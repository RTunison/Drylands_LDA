However, limited information focuses on the combination of rainfall and inflow effects on soil erosion of spoil tips. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify the effects of rainfall intensity, inflow rate and the interaction of rainfall and inflow on the slope erosion of spoil tips. Materials and methods The runoff plot dimensions were 5 mx 1 mx 0.5 m (length x width x depth), and the slopes were set as 32 degrees and 36 degrees. A series of field experiments was conducted to study the effect of rainfall intensity (1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mm min(-1)), inflow rate (8, 10 and 12 L min(-1)) and the interaction between rainfall and inflow on the soil erosion of spoil tips. Results and discussion The results showed that rainfall intensity and inflow rate contributed 22.94-49.87% and 9.24-27.90%, 30.96-50.38% and 13.97-69.73%, respectively, to the runoff and soil loss. The interaction between rainfall and inflow contributed 6.18-38.65% to runoff and 20.72-70.83% to soil loss. The unit stream power, runoff shear stress and stream power can be considered the best hydrodynamic parameter to characterise the dynamic mechanisms of soil erosion under rainfall alone, inflow alone and rainfall + inflow, respectively. The corresponding critical values were 0.013 m s(-1), 4.230 N m(-2) and 0.774 N m(-1) s(-1). A dimensionless model for predicting slope soil erosion of spoil tips under the combination of rainfall and inflow was established based on the comprehensive consideration of rainfall, inflow, topography and runoff factors, which showed satisfactory prediction results (R-2 = 0.887, N-SE = 0.758). Conclusions Inflow rate was the key element affecting the soil erosion of spoil tips. Therefore, in the management of soil erosion in spoil tips, the focus should be on how to effectively regulate runoff from the platform and slope.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				AUG	2022	22	8					2229	2245		10.1007/s11368-022-03205-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-022-03205-z		MAY 2022											WOS:000791625800001

Effect of aggregate breakdown on the unevenly enriched organic carbon process in sediments under a rain-induced overland flow	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Soil organic carbon (SOC) could be enriched in sediments for rain-induced overland flow. However, the features of the enriched SOC distribution in each size of sediment particles and the effect of aggregate breakdown on SOC enrichment features have not been completely investigated. Thus, the SOC concentration of different sizes of sediment aggregates was tested for all samples obtained for 27 simulated rainfall experiments conducted with 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees gradients at rainfall intensities of 45, 90, and 120 mm h(-1), respectively. The changes of SOC composition in aggregates from the original soil to sediments were estimated through the ratios of the variation percentage of the effective and dispersed each size of class sediment particle to that of the original soil particles (Ap). The contribution percentage of aggregate breakdown to the SOC enrichment in sediments (Ca) was also quantified. Results showed that Ca was above 50 % even when under an extremely high rainfall intensity of 120 mm h(-1) on a 15 degrees slope, but Ca decreased with the increase in overall rainfall intensity and slope. When the soil erosion rate is not high enough, Ca decreases with time because of the increase in the soil erosion rate. The absolute values of Aps of all size class particles were increased with the rainfall intensity and slope. However, the absolute values of Aps of clay- or fine silt-sized class particles changing between 0.11 and 0.68 were generally lower than those of coarse silt, fine sand, and coarse sand changing from -3.11 to 1.38, -0.35 to 0.06, and -1.3 to 0, respectively. This result indicates that 0.05-0.25-mm aggregates were more easily broken than other size particles, and the different sizes of particulate organic carbon chippings were more preferred transport than clay/silt-bonded aggregate fragments. The preferred transport of large amounts of 0.25-2-mm-size particulate organic carbon resulted in higher SOC enrichment ratios (ERocs) of 2.58 in 0.25-2-mm particle size class than others. The preferred transport of light particles, for example, mineral-associated and particulate organic carbon chippings exposed by aggregate stripping, caused the uneven enrichment of SOC in sediments. Last, a significantly negative correlation is observed among the mean weight diameter, the enrichment ratio (Er) of each size class particles in sediments, and Ca and ERocs of sediments (P < 0.05). If the rainfall intensity and slope are small, then many aggregates will be broken, and the uneven enrichment of SOC will be enhanced. Overall, our research provides an important reference to further understand the SOC loss mechanisms of soil aggregate induced by water erosion.

Research shows that such buildings are detrimental to their occupants' wellbeing and productivity, sometimes causing them to feel overcooled or overheated. This post-occupancy evaluation illustrates such problems through the case study of a courthouse building in a hot arid environment. A strong association is shown between occupant satisfaction, building ventilation and sense of wellbeing at work. A positive correlation was found between satisfaction with personal control, and overall satisfaction survey results show that workers express a willingness to compromise future salary rises in order to receive operable windows. Key lessons for architects are discussed.

Despite this observation, more than 1.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water. This is particularly true in the Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia regions. OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to assess microbial quality of drinking water and prevalence of water-related diseases in Marigat town, Baringo County, Kenya. METHODS: Samples of drinking water were collected from water sources (boreholes, rivers, and wells) and at the point of use (households) and analyzed for Escherichia coli and total coliform (TC) bacteria using the most probable number method. In situ measurements of pH and temperature were performed using a Wagtech International portable meter. Clinical health records from the local health centers were also reviewed to assess the prevalence rates of some of the water-related diseases. RESULTS: There were significant differences among water sources during dry season for E coli (F-2,F-21 = 3.629, P <.05) and TC (F-2,F-21 = 4.041, P <.05). Similar observations were made during wet season for E coli (F-2,F-21 = 4.090, P <.05) and TC (F-2,F-21 = 1.893, P <.05). Furthermore, there were significant interactions between the water sources and season for E coli (F-2,F-42 = 7.66, P <.01) and TC (F-2,F-42 = 5.494, P <.05). Drinking water in large plastic storage containers (herein referred to as sky-plast) had the highest E coli and TC concentrations. Typhoid was the most prevalent water-related disease during the dry season (10%), whereas diarrhea (3%) was the most prevalent during the wet season. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: All drinking water at abstraction and point of use for Marigat residents are microbiologically contaminated and therefore pose serious health risks to consumers of such water. Thus, there is need for public health awareness campaigns on household water management to curb incidences of water-related diseases. Public health practitioners at county and national levels need to ensure that households have adequate access to potable water and improved sanitation.																			1178-6302					MAR 14	2019	13								1178630219836988	10.1177/1178630219836988	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1178630219836988								30899150					WOS:000462011100001

The morphology, textural properties, magnetic properties, crystal structure and functional groups of the composite were studied. The characterization shows the successful formation of the ternary composite with a high specific surface area (280.39 m(2)/g) and abundant surface functional groups. The magnetic properties of the composite indicate a saturation magnetization of 33.72 emu/g, signifying that the composite can be easily separated with an external magnetic field. The performance of the composite was then investigated through the removal of an anionic azo dye, Acid Blue 113, from aqueous solution. The effect of initial pH of the solution, adsorbent dosage and adsorption contact time was studied. The composite achieved an adsorption capacity of 32.2 mg/g and 96.3% dye removal. Effective dye removal was still achieved after five cycles of adsorption-regeneration, with the dye removal of 74% after the fifth cycle. The analyses of adsorption isotherm and kinetics show that the adsorption process fits pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models, indicating a monolayer chemisorption process. The excellent adsorption performance and reusability of the composite and its magnetic separability signify its potential as an adsorbent for wastewater treatment.

However, little is known about the microbial communities that inhabit deep soil horizons, especially in degraded forest ecosystems. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to investigate the vertical distribution of soil bacterial communities to a depth of 20 m in Pinus tabulaeformis and Robinia pseudoacacia forests on the Loess Plateau, China. We found that bacterial richness declined from the topsoil to a depth of 2 m in P. tabulaeformis forests and declined from the topsoil to a depth of 1 m in R. pseudoacacia forests, and thereafter increased. The relative abundance of alpha-Proteobacteria was higher in subsoils than in topsoils of P. tabulaeformis forests. It was highest at the depth of 20 or 14 m in both forest types, suggesting that alpha-Proteobacteria can survive dry, alkaline, low-nutrient environments. We also found a higher relative abundance of Acidobacteria in topsoils than in subsoils, indicating that Acidobacteria can grow well in nutrient-rich environments. Our results suggest that soil bacterial communities respond to nutrient changes associated with soil depth and plant species. These findings revealed that soil microorganisms persisted in deep and carbon-starved soils, especially for alpha-Proteobacteria, which may be adapted to resource-poor environments in deep soils.

To clarify the effects of species composition and community vertical structure on canopy storage capacity, the artificial wetting and simulated rainfall methods were used to determine the species (C) and community (C-max) water storage, respectively, in three typical grassland communities on the semiarid Loess Plateau. Results indicated that water storage capacity of 31 grassland species ranged from 0.47 to 3.73 g g(-1), with an average of 1.60 g g(-1), and leaf storage capacity was significantly higher than the stem. Plant storage capacity was correlated with leaf traits (including leaf fresh weight, length and area). Canopy storage capacity of three grassland communities (Bothriochloa ischaemum, Artemisia gmelinii and Lespedeza davurica) ranged from 0.77 to 1.09 mm and were positively correlated with community leaf area index (LAI), coverage and leaf dry biomass. Leaf and stem water storage accounted for 57.6% and 42.4% of the total community, respectively. The water storage of Compositae, Gramineae, Leguminosae and other species accounted for 35.5%, 27.0%, 23.4% and 14.1%, respectively. The plants in the community with heights of >40, 20-40 and 0-20 cm contributed 5.8%, 30.3% and 63.9% of the water storage, respectively. The field observed canopy storage capacity was significantly higher than the estimated value through scaling up the individual storage data to the community, revealing complex community structure and species composition may increase actual rainfall interception. These results highlighted the species at 0-20 cm height was the key component affecting canopy water storage, and Compositae species may intercept more rainfall within the community, which imply that reducing the understory or Compositae species composition of grassland community would be helpful for increasing limited rainfall partitioning to soil in the drought area.

Thus, a method to rapidly estimate grassland FVC is highly desired. Although smartphones provide a faster and less expensive method for estimating grassland FVC than satellites and unmaimed aerial vehicles, their accuracy is not well understood. Here, we evaluated the use of smartphones to accurately estimate grassland FVC by taking photos in direct and indirect sunlight at three time points (8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.). We found that smartphone photography could be applied to grassland FVC estimation by extracting a specified percentile of color vegetation index (VIC) to reduce the effect of bright lighting. The 60th percentile value was more suitable for estimating grassland FVC than the 90th percentile, which was proposed in a previous study. We also found that extracting the 60th percentile VIC value from smartphone photos taken at noon under direct sunlight efficiently minimized the influence of lighting on estimated grassland FVC. We propose a model based on the VIC percentile method that can quickly estimate grassland FVC using smartphone photography. This model is very versatile for estimating FVC in semi-arid grasslands. Our findings show that using smartphone photos to quickly estimate grassland FVC is feasible and could provide a practical solution to quickly and accurately estimate grassland FVC.

Optimal utilization of the goat population, is however, impaired by diseases such as brucellosis. Brucellosis is considered as one of the serious diseases incurring considerable loss to the goat industry through reproductive wastages. The situation of brucellosis has not been investigated in goats in Borana pastoral areas despite the frequent occurrence of abortion. This study wasconducted from November 2016 to April 2017, aimed at determining the prevalence of infection with Brucella species, identify the risk factors of infection and understand the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of pastoralists about the disease. Serum samples were collected from a total of 789 goats from three randomly selected pastoral districts. The samples were tested using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA). The study survey results showed that most of the pastoralists (>= 64.2 %) and (>= 81.6 %) had poor knowledge about brucellosis and its zoonotic importance, respectively. From a total of 789 sera samples 137 (17.36 %; 95 % CI: 14.78, 20.19) tested positive for anti-Brucella antibodies. The highest seroprevalence was observed in Elwaya (71/252; 28.17 %; 95 % CI: 22.71, 34.16) followed by Moyale (48/332; 14.46 %; 95 %CI: 10.86, 18.71), whereas the lowest prevalence was observed in Yabello district (15/208; 8.78 %; CI: 5.29, 13.52). The results of multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that sex and age of goats were significantly associated with seroprevalence of brucellosis. The odds of infection was nearly 7 times (OR: 6.97) higher in female goats than in males (P < 0.001). Adult goats were 12 times (OR: 12.19) more likely to be infected than their younger counterparts (P < 0.001). For goats raised in large sized flocks (OR = 2.57; P = 0.028) and for those goats originated from Elwaya district, the risk of infection was significantly higher (OR = 7.91; P < 0.001). The history of occurrence of reproductive problems in female goats is significantly associated with seropositivity to Brucella infection (OR = 5.32; P < 0.001). This study showed that a significant proportion of goats in Borana pastoral districts were infected with Brucella, suggesting its economic implication and zoonotic importance.

We investigated how H2S ameliorates iron (Fe) deficiency in soybean (Glycine maxL.) seedlings. Multidisciplinary approaches including physiological, biochemical and molecular, and transcriptome methods were used to investigate the H2S role in regulating Fe availability in soybean seedlings. Results Our results showed that H2S completely prevented leaf interveinal chlorosis and caused an increase in soybean seedling biomass under Fe deficiency conditions. Moreover, H2S decreased the amount of root-bound apoplastic Fe and increased the Fe content in leaves and roots by regulating the ferric-chelate reductase (FCR) activities and Fe homeostasis- and sulphur metabolism-related gene expression levels, thereby promoting photosynthesis in soybean seedlings. In addition, H2S changed the plant hormone concentrations by modulating plant hormone-related gene expression abundances in soybean seedlings grown in Fe-deficient solution. Furthermore, organic acid biosynthesis and related genes expression also played a vital role in modulating the H2S-mediated alleviation of Fe deficiency in soybean seedlings. Conclusion Our results indicated that Fe deficiency was alleviated by H2S through enhancement of Fe acquisition and assimilation, thereby regulating plant hormones and organic acid synthesis in plants.					zhang, nina/GXH-0962-2022; Chen, Juan/GXF-5536-2022														1471-2229					AUG 20	2020	20	1							383	10.1186/s12870-020-02601-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02601-2								32819279					WOS:000571781600001
J	Wang, J; Wang, XT; Liu, GB; Wang, GL; Wu, Y; Zhang, C				Wang, Jie; Wang, Xiangtao; Liu, Guobin; Wang, Guoliang; Wu, Yang; Zhang, Chao			Fencing as an effective approach for restoration of alpine meadows: Evidence from nutrient limitation of soil microbes	GEODERMA												The effects of restoration on plant communities and soil nutrients have been extensively studied but knowledge of the metabolic requirements of microbial communities is limited, especially in fragile alpine meadow ecosystems. Here, vegetation and soil from four meadows (grazed meadow, fenced meadow, fenced + reseeded meadow, and undegraded meadow) on the Tibetan Plateau were investigated. The nutrient requirements of microbes represented by stoichiometry of extracellular enzyme activities related to soil C, N, and P acquisition (beta-1,4-glucosidase, BG; beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, NAG; leucine aminopeptidase, LAP; and alkaline phosphatase, AP) and their possible environmental drivers were determined. Our results showed that enzymatic C:N:P acquisition in all the meadows deviated from 1:1:1, suggesting that soil enzymatic activity stoichiometry in Tibetan alpine meadows is not homeostatic. Microbial communities in grazed meadows were co-limited by soil N and P levels, and this limitation was closely associated with the stoichiometry of soil nutrients. Activities of BG, NAG + LAP, AP, and their stoichiometry (C:N, C:P, and N:P) in fenced meadows were 38.2%, 32.9%, 51.2%, 16.8%, 19.5% and 2.3% higher than those in grazed meadows. These results indicate that fencing can relieve the N and P limitations for microbial communities in alpine meadows. Seeding the fenced meadow did not increase the soil nutrient content, microbial biomass, or enzyme activity compared with the fenced meadow, possibly owing to the low competition of the seeded species for resources. Changes in extracellular enzyme activity and stoichiometry were better explained by dissolved organic C and microbial biomass N than by plant or other soil properties. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of fencing on the restoration of degraded alpine meadows from the perspective of alleviating microbial nutrient limitations.

The experiment was performed with a completely randomized design with two millet cultivars (Jingu 21 and Zhangza 10) and five K2O rates (0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 kg/hm2) in 2020 and 2021. We found that K promoted K and N absorption; significantly increased dry matter (DM), N, and K accumulation in millet organs; caused dry matter accumulation to peak earlier; and increased the DM accumulation rate. In addition, K accumulation preceded that of DM or N. Relative to the crop cycle, most K (61.07%) accumulated at booting, whereas N accumulated mostly (33.86%) during grain filling. N absorption efficiency increased by 31.87%, and the apparent and agronomic utilization rate of K fertilizer remained high, increasing millet yield, which peaked at a K rate of 180 kg/hm2 for both cultivars, by 29.91% and 31.51% in Jingu 21 and Zhangza 10, respectively, relative to untreated controls. Stepwise regression and path analysis showed that the leaf and spike K accumulation, stem N accumulation, and stem DM were the main factors affecting yield, with DM having the greatest direct effect, followed by leaf K accumulation. The K concentration (0.77-3.04%) in Zhangza 10 was higher than that in Jingu 21 (0.69-2.91%) in untreated plants. Under the same K application rate, N and K accumulation and the harvest index were higher for Zhangza 10 than those for Jingu 21, and the nutrient utilization ability was greater for Zhangza 10. The results demonstrated that rational K fertilizer application can increase K concentration and accumulation in leaves, promote N metabolism and accumulation, increase N and K utilization efficiency, and improve DM accumulation and millet yield.																				2073-4395				SEP	2023	13	9							2200	10.3390/agronomy13092200	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13092200													WOS:001072548600001

The adoption of subsoiling has been recommended to disrupt compacted soil layers and create a reasonable soil structure for crop development. In this paper, the effects of subsoiling depth (30, 35 and 40 cm), period interval (2 or 3 years) and combined pre-sowing tillage practice (rotary cultivation or ploughing) on soil condition improvement was studied on a tidal soil in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain. Seven tillage patterns were designed by combining different subsoiling depths, period intervals and pre-sowing. The evaluation indicators for soil condition improvement were as follows: thickness of the plough layer and hard pan, soil bulk density, cone index, soil three-phase R values, alkali nitrogen content, crop yield, and economic benefits. The results showed that subsoiling can significantly improve the soil structure and physical properties. In all subsoiling treatments, the depth of 35 or 40 cm at a 2-year interval was the most significant. The thickness of the plough layer increased from 13.67 cm before the test to 21.54-23.45 cm in 2018. The thickness of the hard pan decreased from 17.68 cm before the test to 12.09-12.76 cm in 2018, a decrease of about 40.07%. However, the subsoiling combined presowing tillage practice, that is, rotary cultivation or ploughing, was not significant for soil structure and physical properties. For all subsoiling treatments, the soil bulk density, cone index and soil three-phase R values of the 15-25 cm soil layer were significantly lower compared to single rotary cultivation. Subsoiling was observed to increase the soil alkaline nitrogen and water contents. The tillage patterns that had subsoiling at the depth of 35-40 cm at a 2-year interval combined with rotary cultivation had the highest alkali nitrogen and water contents, which increased by 31.08-34.23% compared with that of the single rotary cultivation. Subsoiling can significantly increase the yield both of wheat and corn, as well as the economic benefits. The treatment of subsoiling at the depth of 35 cm at an interval of 2 years combined with rotary cultivation had the highest annual yield and economic benefits. For this treatment, the annual yield and economic benefits increased by 14.55 and 62.87% in 2018, respectively. In conclusion, the tillage patterns that involved subsoiling at a depth of 35 cm at a 2-year interval along with rotary cultivation are suitable for the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain.

Field investigation showed that the NbS (moss-dominated biocrust + intercropping) massively lowered surface soil erosion by 94.5% and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) loss by 94.7 and 96.8% respectively, while promoting rainwater interception by 82.2% relative to bare land (CK). There generally existed positive interactions between biocrust and cropping in the integrated standing biodiversity system. Enhanced plant biomass input into soils substantially promoted soil fungal community diversity and abundance under NbS (p < 0.05). This enabled NbS to evidently improve soil macroaggregate proportion and mean weight diameter. Critically, topsoil carbon storage was increased by 2.5 and 10.7%, compared with CK and pure intercropping (p < 0.05). Conclusively, the standing diversity under such NbS fostered soil C sequestration via water interception and plant-soil-microbe interactions in degraded agricultural soils.					周, 睿/HOA-5317-2023	Zhao, Ze-Ying/0000-0003-2312-6178														2589-0042				JAN 20	2023	26	1							105773	10.1016/j.isci.2022.105773	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2022.105773		DEC 2022						36590166					WOS:000999898800001

Some pastoralists continue to follow more traditional strategies of herd accumulation, while others frequently engage in livestock markets and value addition activities, and others still are dropping out of pastoralism. Using data collected over 6 years from 924 households in northern Kenya and applying a generalized structural dynamic multinomial logit model, this study quantitatively determined the dynamic transitions between livelihood categories conditional on drought incidences. From the results, there were considerable and frequent transitions between livelihood pathways within the panel period (2009-2015). Notably, many households that started in the low-cash income, larger herd size category denoted as hanging in, were transitioning to lower cash income with small herds (dropping out). At the same time, there was a great deal of back and forth between the category with low-cash income and small herd size (dropping out) and the category with higher cash income and small herd size (moving out), indicating that moving out was the only way out of poverty. Also, an increase in vegetation index from a drought season where the index was at a 10% level to a good season where the level was 90% decreased the likelihood of households dropping out from a predicted probability of 37.9 to 28.7% and increased the likelihood of moving up and moving out from 22.2 to 25.0% and 22.6 to 34.3%, respectively, unconditionally. The study findings imply that any livelihood interventions aimed at reducing the impact of drought and alleviating poverty among pastoral households should support the transition to market-oriented, relatively successful pathways and also protect households from falling back into the ranks of poverty by dropping out.

Darrel			Wetting-induced soil CO<sub>2</sub> emission pulses are driven by interactions among soil temperature, carbon, and nitrogen limitation in the Colorado Desert	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Warming-induced changes in precipitation regimes, coupled with anthropogenically enhanced nitrogen (N) deposition, are likely to increase the prevalence, duration, and magnitude of soil respiration pulses following wetting via interactions among temperature and carbon (C) and N availability. Quantifying the importance of these interactive controls on soil respiration is a key challenge as pulses can be large terrestrial sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) over comparatively short timescales. Using an automated sensor system, we measured soil CO2 flux dynamics in the Colorado Desert-a system characterized by pronounced transitions from dry-to-wet soil conditions-through a multi-year series of experimental wetting campaigns. Experimental manipulations included combinations of C and N additions across a range of ambient temperatures and across five sites varying in atmospheric N deposition. We found soil CO2 pulses following wetting were highly predictable from peak instantaneous CO2 flux measurements. CO2 pulses consistently increased with temperature, and temperature at time of wetting positively correlated to CO2 pulse magnitude. Experimentally adding N along the N deposition gradient generated contrasting pulse responses: adding N increased CO2 pulses in low N deposition sites, whereas adding N decreased CO2 pulses in high N deposition sites. At a low N deposition site, simultaneous additions of C and N during wetting led to the highest observed soil CO2 fluxes reported globally at 299.5 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Our results suggest that soils have the capacity to emit high amounts of CO2 within small timeframes following infrequent wetting, and pulse sizes reflect a non-linear combination of soil resource and temperature interactions. Importantly, the largest soil CO2 emissions occurred when multiple resources were amended simultaneously in historically resource-limited desert soils, pointing to regions experiencing simultaneous effects of desertification and urbanization as key locations in future global C balance.

This restricts our ability to understand how changes in soil biodiversity impact soil function and crop productivity. To address this, a 4-year field experiment was conducted in China using three levels of irrigation [high (400 mm), medium (300 mm), and low (200 mm)] and two levels of fertilization [high (600 kg/ha P2O5 + 300 kg/ha urea) and low (300 kg/ha P2O5 + 150 kg/ha urea)] in arid farmland, to investigate maize production, soil properties, bacterial and fungal communities (diversity, compositions, N-cycling potentials, and co-occurrence networks), and their associations. The results showed that irrigation and fertilization had significant effects on bacterial and fungal community diversity, N-cycling potentials, and co-occurrence network patterns during maize growth. The combined treatment of medium irrigation and low fertilization resulted in higher maize yields, bacterial diversity, nitrification, ammoxidation, N-fixation potentials, and network modularity, compared with the other treatments. Strong and positive associations were observed between the soil N-cycling potentials, maize yields, and bacterial diversity; soils supporting a large number of bacterial taxa with co-occurrence network modularity had high soil nutrient levels (organic C and inorganic N) and maize yields. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that bacteria exhibited higher contribution to soil fertility and maize yields than fungi, and irrigation and fertilization indirectly affected microbial functions by altering bacterial diversity and network modularization, which also affected soil fertility and maize yields. These results highlight the importance of microbial diversity and their co-occurrence networks for maintaining soil fertility and crop production and will improve future irrigation and fertilization practices in arid agroecosystems and provide guidance for sustainable crop production.

Decay stages and meteorological factors affect leaf litter's microbial community.? Bacteria and fungi were mainly affected by OC, TN, pH, and water content of leaf litter. ? Bacterial (6.6) and fungal (3.6) Shannon indexes were the largest after 125 days.? Microbial diversity and decay stage directly regulated the litter mass-loss rate.Litter microorganisms play a crucial role in the biological decomposition in forest ecosystems; however, the coupling effect of meteorological and substrate changes on it during the different stages of leaf decomposition in situ remains unclear. Hence, according to meteorological factors dynamics, a one-year field litter of Quercus wutaishanica in situ decomposition experiment was designed for four decay stages in a warm temperate forest. Microbial community composition was characterized using Illumina sequencing of fungal ITS and bacterial 16S genes. Bacterial (6.6) and fungal (3.6) Shannon indexes were the largest after 125 days' litter decomposition (October). The relative abundance of Acidobacteria after 342 days and Bacteroidetes after 125 days were 3 and 24 times higher than after 31 days, respectively. Some non-dominant species (bacteria: Firmicutes, Planctomycotes, and Verrucomicrobia; fungi: Chytridiomycota and Glomeromomycota) may be absent or present at different decomposition stages due to litter properties or meteorological factors. Chemoheterotrophy and aerobic-chemoheterotrophy were the dominant bacterial functional groups, and the dominant fungal functional groups were saprotrophs, pathotrophs, and symbiotrophs. Precipitation and relative humidity significantly affected bacteria. Temperature, sunlight intensity, and net radiation significantly affected fungi. Besides, among the relative contributions of changes in bacterial and fungal community structure, leaf litter properties alone explained the variation of 5.51% and 10.63%. Microbial diversity and decay stage directly affected the litter mass-loss rate, with meteorological factors (precipitation, relative humidity, air temperature, and sunlight intensity) being indirect. Our findings highlight the importance of microbial diversity for leaf litter decomposition and the influence of meteorological factors.																			2662-2289	2662-2297				SEP	2023	5	3							220160	10.1007/s42832-022-0160-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42832-022-0160-4													WOS:000910840400001

However, whether soil acidification stimulates N2O emissions, and if so for what reason contributes to stimulate the emissions is uncertain and how the N2O fractions from fungal (f(fD)) and bacterial (f(bD)) denitrification change with soil pH is unclear. Thus, a pH gradient (6.2, 7.1, 8.7) was set via manipulating cropland soils (initial pH 8.7) in North China to illustrate the effect of soil acidification on fungal and bacterial denitrification after the addition of KNO3 and glucose. For source partitioning, we used and compared SP/delta O-18 mapping approach (SP/delta O-18 MAP) and acetylene inhibition technique combined isotope two endmember mixing model (AIT-IEM). The results showed significantly higher N2O emissions in the acidified soils (pH 6.2 and pH 7.1) compared with the initial soil (pH 8.7). The cumulative N2O emissions during the whole incubation period (15 days) ranged from 7.1 mg N kg(-1) for pH 8.7-18.9 mg N kg(-1) for pH 6.2. With the addition of glucose, relative to treatments without glucose, this emission also increased with the decrement of pH values, and were significantly stimulated. Similarly, the highest N2O emissions and N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratios (rN(2)O) were observed in the pH 6.2 treatment. But the difference was the highest cumulative N2O + N-2 emissions, which were recorded in the pH 7.1 treatment based on SP/delta O-18 MAP. Based on both approaches, f(fD) values slightly increased with the acidification of soil, and bacterial denitrification was the dominant pathway in all treatments. The SP/delta O-18 MAP data indicated that both the rN(2)O and f(fD) were lower compared to AIT-IEM. It has been known for long that low pH may lead to high rN(2)O of denitrification and f(fD), but our documentation of a pervasive pH-control of rN(2)O and f(fD) by utilizing combined SP/delta O-18 MAP and AIT-IEM is new. The results of the evaluated N2O emissions by acidified soils are finely explained by high rN(2)O and enhanced f(fD). We argue that soil pH management should be high on the agenda for mitigating N2O emissions in the future, particularly for regions where long-term excessive nitrogen fertilizer is likely to acidify the soils.																			0269-7491	1873-6424				JUN 15	2022	303								119076	10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119076		MAR 2022						35240268					WOS:000820288200003
J	Liu, DD; She, DL				Liu, Dongdong; She, Dongli			Combined effects of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation of carbonate-derived laterite from karst mountainous lands	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The development of biocrusts and litter cover has been promoted by the vegetation restoration of karst mountainous lands in recent decades. However, the contribution of biocrust and litter to the karst terrestrial water cycle is still unclear. The interactive effects of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation processes were explored by inserting microlysimeters (20 cm radius and 35 cm height) into the karst mountainous lands to collect undisturbed soils. Four moss crust biomass levels (0, 0.32, 0.64 and 0.96 kg m(-2)) and three pine needle biomass levels (0, 0.32 and 0.64 kg m(-2)) were used to estimate the influences of moss crusts and pine needles on evaporation losses and surface temperatures. In addition, the performances of two simplified evaporation concepts considering the interaction effects of moss crusts and pine needles were also assessed. The effect of pine needle cover on reducing evaporation rates was stronger than that of moss crusts. Moreover, the influences of moss crusts on the evaporation rate were obviously restricted by the higher biomass of pine needles, while the effects of pine needles on the evaporation rate were not highly affected by the moss crusts. Furthermore, thermal signatures showed that the pine needles had a much larger positive effect on the surface temperature (pr = 0.50) compared to the effect of the moss crusts (pr = 0.17). There was a significant relationship between the value of Ebare-soil/E-0 and the mean soil water content SWCmean for bare soils. The predictive ability of the one-parameter concept (weighted average vegetation coefficient k(c)) was slightly better than that of the double-parameter concept (moss crust factor k(MC) and pine needle factor k(np)). The key ecohydrological role of ground cover in controlling evaporation cannot be neglected for karst mountainous land management and preventing rocky desertification.

However, the stabilization of SOC and its labile organic C fractions on the Loess Plateau is largely unknown. Our objective was to quantify total SOC concentration and labile organic C fractions in the 0-20 cm soil depth for four land use types on the Loess Plateau, including cropland and three afforested areas (composed of R. pseudoacacia forests, P. tabuliformis forests, and R. pseudoacacia + P. tabuliformis mixed forests). Total SOC concentration, particulate organic C (POC), dissolved organic C (DOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), and potassium permanganate-oxidizable C (KMnO4-C) were measured. Carbon management index (CMI) was also calculated. Afforestation showed a significant positive effect on total SOC and labile organic C fractions, compared with cropland. Afforestation with R. pseudoacacia, P. tabuliformis, and R. pseudoacacia + P. tabuliformis significantly increased POC by 57.4%, 22.2%, and 44.4% in the 0-5 cm soil layer; and similar increases were observed in the 5-10 cm and 10-20 cm layers. Similar trends to those observed for POC in response to afforestation were also seen for DOC, MBC, and KMnO4-C. Afforestation with R. pseudoacacia resulted in the highest total SOC concentrations and labile organic C fractions among the three afforestation treatments. These findings suggested that although afforestation can significantly promote total SOC accumulation, especially with R. pseudoacacia, SOC may become more labile following afforestation in the future.

J	Koda, K; Girmay, G; Berihu, T				Koda, Kazuhisa; Girmay, Gebreyohannes; Berihu, Tesfay			Constructability Criteria for Farmland Reclamation and Vegetable Cultivation Using Micro-Dam Sediments in Tigray, Ethiopia	SUSTAINABILITY												The Ethiopian agriculture sector is characterized by rain-fed smallholder systems. The Ethiopian Government has promoted micro-dam construction in micro-watershed in Tigray for the past two decades. The lack of proper conservation measures to control severe soil erosion at the micro-watershed level, however, has often filled downstream micro-dams in with sediments. Sedimentation has affected the irrigation performance of micro-dams due to their bottom pipes becoming clogged with nutrient-rich soils eroded from upstream farmlands. While there is a growing need for adequate resource management to mitigate severe soil erosion at the watershed-level, it is urgent that methods to make use of the sediments deposited in micro-dam reservoirs to facilitate rural agricultural development are discovered. One practical solution is to use sediments to rehabilitate the bare land excavated for micro-dam embankment construction and turn it into reclaimed farmland. The purpose of this paper is to relate the constructability criteria to the farmland reclamation to solve sedimentation problems. This case study reports the yield of vegetable cultivation on farmland reclaimed using sediments from a micro-dam reservoir in Tigray. This case study highlights the practical potential of such a method to contribute to the livelihoods of farmers through the production of vegetable cash crops. The future research needs cost reduction factors on durability, safety or other related aspects to improve our "Constructability Criteria" approach.

To explore these changeable hydrologic processes, continuous fixed-point observation and water balance models were introduced in nearly-four consecutive hydrological years (2018-2021). The results showed that soil water storage presented a downward fluctuation in each soil layer of all land uses. Moreover, the grassland profile moisture descended slowly and had deeper infiltration depths than others, which might be an ideal land-use type for the reservoir's sustainable utilization in check dams. The results also indicated that surface soil moisture (<50 cm) could rapidly respond to a single rainfall event > 10 mm d-1, whereas deep soil moisture (>50 cm) and shallow groundwater fluctuations were mainly affected by annual cumulative precipitation. Furthermore, a conceptual hydrological model of rainwater falling to the ground, percolating through soil profiles, and reaching groundwater through different vegetation covers in check dams has been proposed. Soil infiltration rates varied under different land use types and depths, ranging from 0.82 to 3.47 cm h-1. The groundwater recharge time from accumulated annual rainfall was 69-250 days, whereas the discharge time due to vegetation water consumption and groundwater lateral movement was 66-774 days. With a decrease in annual rainfall, the recharge time gradually increased, whereas the discharge time gradually decreased. These results inaugurate new perspectives for a deeper understanding of ecohydrological equilibrium in check dams and provide theoretical insights into ecological restoration in semi-arid areas.

Incorporating trade-offs of ESs into land-use decisions has become a major challenge for regional environmental governance, and a deeper understanding of the complex interaction patterns between ESs is a prerequisite for achieving sustainable management of social and ecological systems. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics and trade-off changes in eight ESs on the Loess Plateau during 2000-2015 using multi-source data and integrated explicit assessment methods, with the following results: 1) Grain production was widely distributed, raw material provision and net primary productivity (NPP) showed northwest to southeast stepwise growth, carbon sequestration and soil conservation were concentrated in high vegetation coverage areas in the southeast, oxygen production was similarly distributed to raw material provision, and recreational and cultural services were centered in urbanized areas. 2) There were significant synergies among raw material provision, oxygen production and NPP, with trade-offs existing mainly between water conservation and NPP, oxygen production, and raw material provision, all of which had consistently increasing correlation coefficients. 3) The number of trade-off service pairs increased, and the intensity of trade-offs strengthened where the pairs between grain production and oxygen production, recreation, and NPP changed from synergy to trade-off. It is recommended that the long-term impacts of urban land expansion, slope afforestation, and climatic factors such as precipitation and temperature on water conservation and other services be assessed in an integrated manner in ecosystem management and that appropriate, scientific response strategies be developed. This study provides theoretical and decision-making references for regulating the complex trade-offs of ESs in ecologically fragile regions worldwide.

However, the mechanisms of soil N-cycling and N2O emissions remain poorly understood, especially in alpine ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the soil N-cycling process in four alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau along a degradation gradient using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and amplicon sequencing to elucidate the mechanisms. Compared to non-degraded meadows, meadow degradation reduced N2O emissions by 38.5-140.2%. Meadow degradation reduced the abundance of amoA of ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB), whereas light and moderate degradation increased the abundance of genes nirS, nirK, and nosZ. Lightly degraded meadow exhibited the highest alpha-diversity of both nitrifiers and denitrifiers, but this higher diversity was not accompanied by higher N2O emissions, with only 32.3% of the microbial taxa identified as predictors of N2O emissions, suggesting that functional redundancy exists in the N-cycling process in meadow ecosystems. Nitrosospira and Mesorhizobium from the AOB and nirK communities, respectively, were identified as the key taxa that may contribute to N2O emissions. Soil properties, especially N reaction substrates, including ammonium-N, nitrate-N, dissolved organic N, and total N, were the primary drivers for N2O emissions via mediation of the N-cycling community, especially nitrifiers. Our results emphasised the importance of environmental factors in shaping nitrifying, denitrifying, and N2O emissions, providing insights for the restoration of degraded meadow ecosystems.

Although fish are a healthy source of protein, they can also spread diseases caused by pathogenic micro-organisms they may harbor. Epidemiology of foodborne pathogens is not well studied in Ethiopia. To address this issue to some extent, a cross-sectional study with a simple random sampling approach was conducted from October 2017 to May 2018 with the objectives of to isolate and estimate the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157: H7 in fish, and to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the isolates in selected Lakes of Northern Ethiopia. All the microbial identification and isolation procedures were conducted based on ISO 6887-3:2017 recommendations. Antimicrobial susceptibility test was also performed following the standard procedure of Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion protocol. From the total 410 fish samples examined, six (1.46%) of them were found contaminated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157: H7 strain. The organism was isolated from landing sites (5/293) and local retail markets (1/75). Besides, Escherichia coli O157: H7 was isolated from filleted fish (5/214) and whole fish (1/125); however, it was not isolated from samples of ready to eat fish and working environments of restaurants. The antibiotic susceptibility test revealed that the isolates were resistant to Ampicillin and Streptomycin disks. However, Ciprofloxacin, Gentamicin and Nalidixic acid were found effective in inhibiting the growth of all of the isolates. Since pathogenic Escherichia coli strain was detected from fish, raw and undercooked fish consumption in Ethiopia may result in contracting infections. The occurrence of such pathogenic organisms in fish indicates the need for intervention by stakeholders. Supports like freezers, generators, the establishment of fish processing plants and on job training about proper fish handling practices may play a tremendous role in decreasing the level of contamination of fish in Ethiopia.

However, with the increasing nutrient input into terrestrial ecosystems from human activities, the responses of soil microorganisms to the aboveground vegetation across agricultural-to-natural succession stages are still poorly understand. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes of soil microbial communities in three typical succession stages (the cropland, the grassland, and the brushland, respectively).Materials and methodsA field experiment was carried out in an ecological restoration region. Soil samples were collected from three succession stages (the cropland, the grassland, and the brushland) based on their well-dated successional chronosequence in July 2016. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to identify the bacterial community structures. The responses of soil bacterial communities and its relationships with soil physicochemical properties and enzyme activities were assessed.Results and discussionThe results showed that soil nutrients (soil organic carbon(SOC), total N, and NH4+) and enzyme activities (-1,4-glucosidase and phosphatase) were significantly increased across the conversion from agricultural to natural ecosystem, and the enzyme activities were significantly affected by SOC and total N. It indicated that vegetation restoration greatly improved soil quality and nutrient cycling rates mediated by microbial metabolisms. Furthermore, there were no changes in soil bacterial community structures during the three vegetation succession stages, which implied the stability and adaption of microbial communities under the vegetation succession in semiarid climate. It should be noted that Firmicutes taxa were more sensitive than other taxa during natural vegetation recovery. Structural equation model (SEM) revealed that soil nutrients (soil organic matter (SOM) and total P), element stoichiometry (SOC:total P), and extracellular enzyme activities (urease and alkaline phosphatase) were dominant factors to shape the relative abundance of Firmicutes.ConclusionsFirmicutes can be considered as bio-indicators to monitor soil quality and nutrient turnover during natural vegetation recovery. This study presents better understanding about the connections among soil nutrient cycling, enzyme activities, and soil bacterial communities during vegetation natural restoration, especially in typical ecological critical zone.

Ken; Li, Zhi			Conversion from farmland to orchards has minor effects on nitrogen biological processes in deep loess deposits	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												High nitrate (NO3--N) accumulation has been observed globally in vadose zones due to the overuse of synthetic fertilizer, but its impacts on nitrogen (N) biological processes remain poorly understood, especially after land use conversion from farmlands to deep-rooted apple orchards. In this study, we collected paired soil samples to determine available N contents, NO3--N isotopes, and abundances of N functional genes (NFGs) in 10-m loess profiles under cultivated farmlands and adjacent apple orchards (n = 300). The average NO3--N accumulation under orchards was 4773 kg N ha (1) (10 times higher than farmlands), with the NO3--N profiles resembling a parabolic curve within 0 -4 m below the surface. Regardless of excessive fertilizer application and welldeveloped root systems, the deep-rooted orchards had minor effects on N sources and biological processes in deep loess deposits, as indicated by our estimates of isotopes and NFGs abundances. We hypothesized that the limited and inactive microorganisms in the subsoil are more resistant to environmental disturbances, and that carbon source and ammonium substrate dominated the gene expression and occurrence of NFGs-indicated biological processes. The limited root biomass per unit depth and the inhibition effects of a dry soil horizon on root turnover and exudate release likely contributed to the less perturbed N biological processes under orchards. As the first study to explore N transformation processes in 10-m loess deposits, this study provided insights for complicated N biogeochemical cycles in arid regions with deep unsaturated soils and intensive agricultural land use.

J	Kou, M; Jiao, JY				Kou, Meng; Jiao, Juying			Changes in vegetation and soil properties across 12 years after afforestation in the hilly-gully region of the Loess Plateau	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Vegetation restoration is the primary method used to prevent soil erosion and improve the ecological environment. The objective of this study was to explore how vegetation and soil properties changed over time in natural and artificial vegetation types. We conducted vegetation surveys in four permanent plots over 12 years (2007-2018) and measured soil properties in 2007, 2013, and 2016. The results showed that the change in species composition in natural vegetation was a continuous and progressive process. After approximately ten years of natural herb restoration, trees began to appear and formed sparse forests. In artificial vegetation, the species composition of the undergrowth varied under Robinia pseudoacacia forests during restoration years, and was dominated by Poaceae and annual plants that could tolerate shade and drought. Species composition was stable under Caragana korshinskii shrubs, where the undergrowth was dominated by perennial plants that were similar to natural vegetation. In different vegetation types, species richness, diversity, and herb community cover fluctuated, while the succession rate decreased with the number of restoration years. The soil moisture condition was better in natural vegetation than in artificial vegetation, and could be maintained near the stable field capacity. The soil moisture was supplemented to 280 cm in R. pseudoacacia forests and 320 cm in C. korshinskii shrubs in a year with extreme rainfall, but the dry soil layer returned in the following years. Soil nutrients improved over time, especially in artificial vegetation, which appears to be better than natural vegetation. In general, natural vegetation improved plant community and soil properties. Artificial vegetation only improved soil nutrients, but caused soil desiccation which is difficult to recover. Therefore, the natural vegetation restoration model of sparse forest grassland was better than artificial vegetation model.																				2351-9894				JAN	2022	33								e01989	10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01989	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01989													WOS:000743069700007

However, currently, research with regard to freezing and thawing processes under various vegetation types and the mechanism of soil water movement is lacking. Therefore, the present study explored soil water migration characteristics of two typical vegetation types [arbor land (AL) and shrub land (SL)] on the Loess Plateau during seasonal freezing and thawing processes using bare land (BL) as a control. We used field measured data for hourly soil temperature (ST) and soil water content (SWC) at a depth of 100 cm below the soil surface from November 2017 to March 2018. Freezing and thawing process was divided into three stages based on ST change (initial freezing period, stable freezing period, and thawing period). Compared with previous studies in this area, ST is lower than expected, and SWC migration characteristics are also different. The results revealed that: 1) the maximum freezing depth of AL and SL was 60 cm, which was 30 cm less than that of BL. The freezing date of each soil layer in BL was the earliest and average ST value was the lowest. BL had the highest degree of freezing. The freezing of all soil layers in AL occurred at a later date than that of SL. ST and the minimum soil freezing temperatures were higher than those of SL, and the capacity of AL to resist freezing was higher; 2) the SWCs in AL and BL at depths of 0-10 cm and 10-30 cm decreased, whereas SWCs of AL and BL at a depth of 60 cm increased by 152 and 146%, respectively. The SWCs of SL at soil depths of 0-10 cm, 10-30 cm, and 30-60 cm increased by 46.3, 78.4 and 205%, respectively. The amount and distribution of soil moisture in SL were optimum when compared to those of AL and BL. The results of the present study could provide a scientific basis for vegetation restoration in arid and semi-arid areas of the Loess Plateau.

J	Li, D				Li, Dan			The O'KEYPS Equation and 60 Years Beyond	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY												Some 60 years ago, six researchers obtained a semi-empirical equation that describes how the stability correction function for the mean velocity profile (phi(m)) in the atmospheric surface layer varies with the stability parameter-the famous O'KEYPS equation. Their derivations are essentially based on interpolation of the turbulent eddy viscosity between neutral and convective conditions. Comparing the O'KEYPS equation with new theoretical developments-such as phenomenological and cospectral budget models-suggests that Heisenberg's eddy viscosity provides a unifying framework for interpreting the behaviour of phi(m). The empirical coefficient in the O'KEYPS equation, which is on the order of 10 based on data fitting to observations, is found to be primarily linked to the increase of the size of turbulent eddies as instability increases. The ratio of the sizes of turbulent eddies under convective and neutral conditions is on the order of 1/kappa, where kappa is the von Karman constant, and is modulated by the turbulent Prandtl number.

Based on 3 years of field experiment, this study systematically investigated the soil microorganisms and soil properties in the 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layers. This study found that M//P changed the soil microbial community composition compared to monoculture modes in all the studied soil layers but had the most effects in the 10-20 cm soil layer. Soil organic carbon, available phosphorus and available potassium explained the most variation in the microbial composition, whileProteobacteria, AcidobacteriaandPlanctomyceteswere the phyla that were most affected by environmental factors. Based on the correlations and microbial function analysis, we speculated that: 1) M//P increased the relative abundance ofChlorobi, ParcubacteriaandChlamydiae, which promoted carbon and nitrogen metabolism; 2) M//P increased the relative abundance ofChlamydiae, Saccharibacteria, andParcubacteriaand then enhanced phosphonate and phosphinate metabolism, providing more available phosphorus for crops; 3) some KEGG pathways related to immunity and disease were increased in M//P, which may be related to disease control.					cheng, shu/IZE-4788-2023; GUO, FENG/JRX-3555-2023; Zhang, Jing/ISA-6627-2023; Si, Tong/ACE-9331-2022; zhang, jin/GXV-9154-2022	Zhang, Jing/0009-0003-5039-5688; Si, Tong/0000-0003-4984-9585; xiaoxia, zou/0000-0002-1087-6167													0365-0340	1476-3567				DEC 6	2021	67	14					1986	1999		10.1080/03650340.2020.1818725	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2020.1818725		SEP 2020											WOS:000568927700001

To resolve this challenge, a novel topography meter was used to observe shallow mass movements on the gully slopes of the Loess Plateau under simulated rainfall. The experiment showed that the cumulative shallow mass movement volume logarithmically increased with the rainfall amount. The critical rainfall for shallow mass movement occurrence was about 28 mm at a rainfall intensity of 50 mm h(-1). The results also show that soil water content was a key element controlling the occurrence of the shallow mass movements, and the minimal soil water content for permitting shallow mass movements was about 23.1-25.6% for 10-20 cm deep soil. Shallow mass movement on gully slopes has a significant influence on sediment yield. The sediment concentration and sediment transport rate during mass movement failure were on average 3.6 times and 4.0 times higher than that during pre-failure events, respectively. Our results have important implications for understanding the connectivity of sediment discharge and mass movements on gully slopes in hilly and gully watersheds.

In this study, a split-root system was used to simulate non-uniform root zone salinity. Our hydroponic experiments showed that wheat seedlings under non-uniform salt stress probably use a salt avoidance strategy to ensure growth. RNA sequencing analysis showed that 1648 and 3245 differentially expressed genes were identified in 0/150 and 75/75 salt treatments, respectively, with an intersection of 690 genes. Gene ontology terms representing normal growth were specifically enriched by upregulated genes in the 0/150 treatment and downregulated genes in the 75/75 treatment, and terms representing phytoremediation were specifically enriched by upregulated genes in the 75/75 treatment and downregulated genes in the 0/150 treatment. Differentially expressed genes that are probably associated with salt stress and transcription factors showed significantly higher expression in the 75/75 treatment than in the 0/150 treatment. These findings suggest that a uniform salt treatment causes wheat to initiate a more complex salt tolerance mechanism for salt stress. In addition, the expression of 11 genes annotated as peroxidase was higher in the 0/150 treatment than in the 75/75 treatment, and the enzyme activity showed the same trend, indicating that peroxidase probably played a role in the better performance of wheat plants under non-uniform salt stress. Pot culture experiments showed that wheat plants under non-uniform salt stress produced higher yields than those under uniform stress, further indicating that inducing unequal salt distribution in soil could significantly improve wheat cultivation.																			0008-4220	1918-1833				FEB	2021	101	1					107	118		10.1139/cjps-2020-0021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjps-2020-0021													WOS:000618244700011

Population structure drives cultural diversity in finite populations: A hypothesis for localized community patterns on Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile)	PLOS ONE												Understanding how and why cultural diversity changes in human populations remains a central topic of debate in cultural evolutionary studies. Due to the effects of drift, small and isolated populations face evolutionary challenges in the retention of richness and diversity of cultural information. Such variation, however, can have significant fitness consequences, particularly when environmental conditions change unpredictably, such that knowledge about past environments may be key to long-term persistence. Factors that can shape the outcomes of drift within a population include the semantics of the traits as well as spatially structured social networks. Here, we use cultural transmission simulations to explore how social network structure and interaction affect the rate of trait retention and extinction. Using Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile) as an example, we develop a model-based hypothesis for how the structural constraints of communities living in small, isolated populations had dramatic effects and likely led to preventing the loss of cultural information in both community patterning and technology.

Although operational taxonomic units (OTUs) have been used to classify species, amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) have been shown to be effective in representing microdiversity within OTUs at a finer genetic scale. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the role of microdiversity in influencing the distribution of rhizosphere-associated microbial species across environmental gradients from root surface to bulk soil at the OTU and ASV levels. Here, the microbial community structures of bulk, loosely bound, and tightly bound soil samples from maize rhizosphere were examined at OTU and ASV levels. The results showed that OTU and ASV methods exhibited similar microbial community structures in rhizosphere. Additionally, different ecotypes with varying distributions and habitat preferences were observed within the same bacterial OTU at the ASV level, indicating a rich bacterial microdiversity. In contrast, the fungal community exhibited low microdiversity, with no significant relationship between fungal microdiversity and persistence and variability. Moreover, the ecotypes observed within the bacterial OTUs were found to be positively or negatively associated with environmental factors, such as soil organic carbon (SOC), NO3--N, NH4+-N contents, and pH. Overall, the results showed that the rich microdiversity could sustain the distribution of rhizosphere-associated bacterial species across environmental gradients from root surface to bulk soil. Further genetic analyses of rhizosphere-associated bacterial species could have considerable implications for potential mediation of microdiversity for sustainable crop production.																			1664-462X					OCT 12	2023	14								1266218	10.3389/fpls.2023.1266218	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1266218								37905168					WOS:001087345100001
J	Ben-Zvi, G; Seifan, M; Giladi, I				Ben-Zvi, Gilad; Seifan, Merav; Giladi, Itamar			Ant Guild Identity Determines Seed Fate at the Post-Removal Seed Dispersal Stages of a Desert Perennial	INSECTS												Simple Summary Ants play a dual role in their interaction with plant seeds. Many ant species, mainly harvester ants, consume plant seeds (granivory), whereas other ants, mainly scavengers, provide a beneficial seed dispersal service. Granivory by ants is frequently documented in deserts, but beneficial seed dispersal is rarely studied in such ecosystems. We followed the handling of seeds of Sternbergia clusiana, an ant-dispersed plant, by two guilds of desert ants. We focused on the treatment of seeds within the nest and on the redispersal of seeds after ejection from the nest. Scavenging ants rarely consumed the seed itself, they deposited most seeds away from the nest in apparently suitable microhabitats. In addition, we found that most of the seeds that were relocated by scavenging ants arrived at sites under the canopy of shrubs. Such sites might be beneficial for the establishment and success of plants in the arid environment. Indeed, we found that the subject plant was more likely to be found under shrubs than elsewhere, which suggests that it benefits from being placed there. Such documentation of seed dispersal activity by scavenging ants in arid ecosystems suggests they may be efficient seed dispersers in deserts, as they are in other ecosystems. Ants play a dual role in their interaction with plant seeds. In deserts, the consumption of seeds by granivorous ants is common, whereas mutualistic seed dispersal, often associated with scavenging ants, is rarely documented. We evaluated the contribution of both ant guilds to efficient seed dispersal of an ant-dispersed plant, Sternbergia clusiana, in a desert ecosystem. We presented seed to colonies of three species of desert ants from the Cataglyphis (scavengers) and Messor (granivorous) genera. We recorded seed consumption, ejection from the nest, and seed transportation to potentially beneficial microhabitats. We evaluated microhabitat quality by testing the association between habitat types and the plant at various life stages. As expected, granivores mainly consumed the seeds, whereas scavengers consumed the elaiosome (seed appendage serving as a reward), but left the seeds intact. Moreover, scavenging ants relocated the seeds much further than granivores, mainly to shrub patches. The disproportional distribution of the plant under shrubs at several life stages suggests that this microhabitat is beneficial for the plant. Overall, while granivores seem to mainly harm seed dispersal, we provide the first evidence for the beneficial contribution of scavenging ants in deserts, showing they exhibit the same suite of characteristics that render them efficient seed dispersers in other ecosystems.

The buildup of labile nutrient pools in soils under annual plants may indirectly facilitate succession by other plants, thus aiding the establishment of vegetation patches in deserts. Nutrient accumulation under annual plants can lead to faster nitrogen (N) cycling and increased resource availability. Methods To understand how the establishment of annual plants affects soil nutrient dynamics, we planted patches of a widespread local summer annual plant, unarmed saltwort (Salsola inermis Forssk.) and assessed how these patches influence the soil N cycle and soil N2O emissions. We hypothesized that annual plant establishment would enhance resource accumulation and accelerate soil N cycle rates in the soil beneath the plant patch. Results Our results supported our hypothesis; we measured the highest soil N cycle rates and soil N2O emissions under the plant patch, while they decreased across the patch-to-bare-soil gradient, suggesting an accelerated N cycle within the planted areas. Water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and ammonia accumulation in the surface soil beneath the plants was associated with a large burst in soil N2O emissions within the patch, following dry soil wetting by the first winter rains. Conclusions Our results suggest that the establishment of annual summer-flourishing plants affects soil nutrient dynamics and accumulation, thus creating nutrient-rich microsites for potential succession by other annuals and perennials, processes that may lead to fertility island establishment in the Negev Desert ecosystem.

Crop water and nitrogen productivity in response to long-term diversified crop rotations and management systems	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Diversified crop rotation and management strategies may affect crop water and N productivity. We studied the effect of tillage, crop rotation, and management system on pre-plant and postharvest soil water storage, annualized crop yield, water use, and water and N productivity from 2005 to 2010 in the northern Great Plains, USA. Tillage were conventional tillage and no-tillage; crop rotations were continuous spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (CW), spring wheat-pea (Pisum sativum L.) (WP), spring wheat-forage barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)-pea (WBP), and spring wheat-forage barley-corn (Zea mays L.)-pea (WBCP). Managements were traditional (a combination of recommended seeding rate, broadcast N fertilization, early planting, and short stubble height) and alternate (a combination of increased seeding rate, banded N fertilization, late planting, and tall stubble height) systems. Aboveground biomass was 16-85%, preplant soil water 23-118%, postharvest soil water 38-246%, and water productivity 28-61% greater with WBCP than CW in 3 out of 6 yr. Crop water use and biomass N accumulation varied with tillage, crop rotations, and management systems in various years. Grain yield was 26-41% and grain water productivity 25-32% lower with WBP than other crop rotations. Grain N accumulation was 20-52%, grain N productivity 23-60%, and grain and biomass N removal indices 18-153% greater with WP than CW and WBCP, but biomass N productivity was 98-110% lower with CW than other crop rotations. Diversified crop rotation with longer rotation length increased crop yield, soil water storage, and water productivity, but shorter rotation with legume increased grain and biomass N productivity and N removal.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 1	2021	257								107149	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107149	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107149		SEP 2021											WOS:000703508100005

However, whether different levels of fertilization will affect the response of wheat yields to inter-annual climate variations and long-term climate trends is not clear. In this study, 35-year wheat yields were used to investigate the responses of wheat yield to inter-annual climate variations and long-term climate trends under different fertilization treatments. The first difference method was used to de-trend wheat yields and climate variables and stepwise regression analysis was used to quantify the yield-climate relationship. The experimental design consisted of a control treatment (CK without fertilization) and three fertilizer treatments: nitrogen, phosphorus, and manure (NPM with 120 kg ha(-1) N, 26.2 kg ha(-1) P, and 75 t ha(-1) manure), nitrogen and phosphorus (NP with 120 kg ha(-1) N and 26.2 kg ha(-1) P), and manure (M with 75 t ha(-1) manure). Compared to the CK treatment, the NPM, NP, and M treatments increased wheat yield by an average of 201.9, 161.7, and 130.6% and increased yield inter-annual variability by an average of 191.2, 149.3, and 144.2%, respectively, during the study period (1985-2020). Inter-annual climate fluctuations in the study area explained 45, 38, 27, and 29% of wheat yield variations and 35-year climatic trends contributed to wheat yield decreases of 0.3, 0.7, 1.6, and 1.8% for the NPM, NP, M, and CK treatments, respectively. The results show the impact of inter-annual climate fluctuations on yield increases with the increasing level of fertilization, while the effect of long-term climate trends on yield decreases with the increasing level of fertilization.					li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023; Zhang, Yanyan/JFA-9161-2023; liu, xq/JDW-2596-2023; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; Liu, Gui/JHU-8707-2023; qi, li/JFE-7167-2023; Yang, Ying/ABD-2481-2022; Yang, Ying/ADL-4165-2022; peng, jy/JMB-2297-2023; peng, yan/JCO-1763-2023; Li, Ly/JCD-4746-2023; xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; li, yao/IYJ-1364-2023	Yang, Ying/0000-0002-3469-7681; peng, jy/0000-0001-9665-1059; huang, ming bin/0000-0001-9792-3124														2077-0472				SEP	2022	12	9							1498	10.3390/agriculture12091498	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12091498													WOS:000857429800001

Density is an important structural factor in forest plantations but information on changes in fine roots along a density gradient is limited. In this study, plantations of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis Carr.) with four density classes were analyzed for the influence of soil and leaf traits on fine root growth. Fine root biomass increased with stand density. High fine root biomass was achieved through increases in the fine root production and turnover rate in the high-density black locust plantations and through an increase in fine root production in the pine plantations. In the high-density Chinese pine stand, there was a high fine root turnover which, coupled with high fine root production, contributed to a high fine root biomass. Overall, fine root production and turnover rate were closely related to soil volumetric water content in both kinds of plantations, while fine root biomass, especially the component of necromass, was related to soil nutrient status, which refers to phosphorous content in black locust plantations and nitrogen content in Chinese pine plantations. There was a close linkage between leaf area index and fine root dynamics in the black locust plantations but not in the pine plantations.

However, it remains unclear how N deposition affects SOC decomposition by regulating microbial community composition and function, especially C-cycling functional gene composition. We investigated the effects of N addition (0, 3, 6, and 9 g N m(-2) y(-1)) on the composition of soil microbial C-cycling functional gene, SOC-degrading enzyme activities, and CO2 emissions in a Pinus tabulaeformis forest. Under low N addition (3 or 6 g N m(-2) y(-1)), labile C-degradation gene abundances were significantly increased. Under high N addition (9 g N m(-2) y(-1)), C-cycling functional gene abundance and diversity were significantly decreased. These effects were related to the changes in soil NO3--N, dissolved organic C, total N, and microbial biomass C contents. Furthermore, low N addition stimulated the activities of SOC-degrading enzyme and CO2 emissions, whereas high N addition had the inhibitory effect. C-degradation gene abundances were significantly correlated with the SOC-degrading enzyme activities and CO2 emissions. Increase in CO2 emission rates were related to the high microbial functional potentials for labile C degradation under low N addition, whereas the lower CO2 emission rates were related to the low microbial functional potentials for labile as well as recalcitrant C degradation under high N addition. Our study indicated that N deposition may change SOC decomposition by altering the abundance of labile C and recalcitrant C degradation genes.

A field experiment was conducted in the NCP during 2012-2016 to evaluate the effects of urea, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate applied by drip fertigation (no N as the control, CK) on grain yield, water use efficiency (WUE), N use efficiency (NUE) and N loss in wheat and maize. A total of 250 kg N ha(-1) and 205.5 kg N ha(-1) were split into six and four applications and applied by drip fertigation at key growth stages during the wheat and maize growing seasons, respectively. The results showed that urea and calcium nitrate produced higher yields (p < 0.05) than ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate in the first year of the study in both wheat and maize, whereas in subsequent years, ammonium sulfate increased the yield of wheat by 11.3 %-25.1 %, 13.7 %-46.1 % and 16.4 %-32.7 % compared with urea, ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate, respectively. Urea and ammonium sulfate averagely produced higher maize yields than ammonium nitrate and calcium nitrate, but no significant difference in maize yield was found between urea and ammonium sulfate. Similar trends in WUE and NUE were recorded in both crops. Ammonium sulfate contributed to higher WUE and NUE in wheat compared to the other N fertilizers except in the first year, while urea contributed to higher WUE and NUE in maize. The total apparent N loss in urea was 13.9 %, 15.4 % and 15.8 % lower (p < 0.05) than those in ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate and calcium nitrate after three cycles of the rotation (2012-2015), respectively. Considering both yield and NUE, and based on the results of apparent N loss for the four N fertilizers under field conditions, ammonium sulfate was recommended as the superior N source for wheat under drip fertigation, while urea was the optimal N source for maize under drip fertigation.

J	Wang, ZF; Zheng, FL				Wang, Zongfei; Zheng, Fenli			Ecological stoichiometry of plant leaves, litter and soils in a secondary forest on China's Loess Plateau	PEERJ												Ecological stoichiometry can reveal nutrient cycles in soil and plant ecosystems and their interactions. However, the ecological stoichiometry characteristics of leaf-littersoil system of dominant grasses, shrubs and trees are still unclear as are their intrinsic relationship during vegetation restoration. This study selected three dominant plant types of grasses (Imperata cylindrica (I. cylindrica) and Artemisiasacrorum (A.sacrorum)), shrubs (Sophora viciifolia (S. viciifolia) and Hippophae rhamnoides (H. rhamnoides)) and trees (Quercus liaotungensis (Q. liaotungensis) and Betula platyphylla (B. platyphylla)) in secondary forest areas of the Chinese Loess Plateau to investigate ecological stoichiometric characteristics and their intrinsic relationships in leaf-litter-soil systems. The results indicated that N concentration and N:P ratios in leaf and litter were highest in shrubland; leaf P concentration in grassland was highest and litter in forestland had the highest P concentration. Soil C, N and P concentrations were highest in forestland (P < 0.05) and declined with soil depth. Based on the theory that leaf N:P ratio indicates nutritional limitation of plant growth, this study concluded that grass and shrub growth was limited by N and P element, respectively, and forest growth was limited by both of N and P elements. The relationships between the N concentration in soil, leaf and litter was not significant (P >0.5), but the soil P concentration was significantly correlated with litter P concentration (P < 0.05). These finding enhance understanding of nutrient limitations in different plant communities during vegetation restoration and provide insights for better management of vegetation restoration.																			2167-8359					OCT 14	2020	8								e10084	10.7717/peerj.10084	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10084								33088618					WOS:000577070600002
J	Brooksbank, K; Goodwin, A				Brooksbank, Kim; Goodwin, Adrian			A model of coppice biomass recovery for mallee-form eucalypts	NEW FORESTS												Planting mallee-form eucalypts amongst crops has the potential to remedy environmental degradation caused by land clearing in low rainfall regions, whilst also providing income through carbon-sequestration or periodic coppicing. Management options can be supported by models of biomass and coppice recovery, and this paper presents the first empirical coppice growth model for mallee eucalypts. Uncoppiced and coppiced belt-planted Eucalyptus polybractea, E. loxophleba and E. kochii were harvested and roots excavated to provide estimates of shoot and root biomass for analysis and model development. Allometric models of shoot biomass were appropriate for both uncoppiced and coppiced trees, but models of root/total biomass ratio for coppice depended on site quality and age, and could not be modelled allometrically. Mean root/total biomass proportions for uncoppiced trees were estimated (with standard errors) to be 0.38 (0.009), 0.50 (0.031), and 0.46 (0.021) for E. polybractea, E. loxophleba, and E. kochii respectively and were sensitive to site quality but insensitive to age. The time taken to regain pre-coppice shoot biomass was about half that of full pre-cut root/total biomass ratio recovery, and was affected by coppicing age and site quality. A conceptual model of coppice growth indicated that coppiced stands may produce more total biomass than uncoppiced stands of the same age.																			0169-4286	1573-5095				MAY	2022	53	3					449	468		10.1007/s11056-021-09863-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-021-09863-0		JUL 2021											WOS:000678018200001

For food-insecure rural areas, understanding the nature of precipitation variability and its teleconnection has paramount importance in guiding regional and local-level decisions. In this study, we analyzed the monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation variability and the strength of its teleconnection with the global sea-surface temperature (SST) and El Nino/La Nina Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices in the food-insecure rural areas of Tigray region, Ethiopia. The precipitation, SST, and ENSO indices data for the study were used from 1979 to 2019. A summary of descriptive statistics and Mann-Kendall test methods were applied to detect the existence of trends, and Sen's slope and coefficient of variation are used to analyze the magnitude of the trend and degree of variation in the precipitation pattern. Further, Pearson's correlation is used to determine the effect of ENSO, and SST variations on the precipitation using the canonical correlation analysis. The results revealed that the precipitation over the three districts is characterized by a distinctive bimodal pattern with limited rains in March-May preceding the main rainy season June-September. The limited amount of precipitation, exacerbated by a higher degree of variability, makes the food production in the three districts more uncertain. Besides, there was a very significant decline in the trend of March-May average precipitation and a significant decline in the trend of the annual average precipitation in Hintalo area. The SST of central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, and northeast and northwest equatorial Atlantic Ocean was strongly correlated with the April average precipitation of the three districts. Further, SST of the south, west, and southwest of the equatorial Indian Ocean, and west equatorial Pacific Ocean was associated with July-September average precipitation with greater variation in strength among of the three districts. Moreover, July's average precipitation of the three districts, April's average precipitation of Atsbi and Eirop, and May's precipitation of Hintalo are found significantly associated with the ENSO indices of JFM, FMA, MJJ, and MAM. Therefore, the task of achieving food security in the three districts should incorporate the design of informed food production strategies that can adapt to the limited and variable precipitation based on these SST and ENSO indices.

However, the relative importance of root size and uptake efficiency remains undetermined. A pot experiment was conducted using two wheat varieties with different root sizes to evaluate their capacity for water and nitrogen (N) uptake and their effects on grain production, water-use efficiency (WUE), and N-use efficiency (NUE) under two water treatments combined with three N levels. RESULTSThe leaf water potential and root exudates of changhan58 (CH, small root variety) were higher or similar to those of changwu134 (CW, large root variety) under water/N treatment combinations, indicating that small roots can transport enough water to above the ground. The addition of N improved plant growth, photosynthetic traits, and WUE significantly. There were no significant differences in WUE or grain production between the two cultivars under well-watered conditions. However, they were significantly higher in CH than in CW under water deficit stress. Nitrogen uptake per unit root dry weight, glutaminase, and nitrate reductase activities were significantly higher in CH than in CW, regardless of moisture conditions. Root biomass was positively correlated with evapotranspiration, while the root/shoot ratio was negatively correlated with WUE (P < 0.05) but not with NUE. CONCLUSIONIn a pot experiment, water and N uptake were more strongly associated with resource uptake availability than root size. This may provide guidance in wheat breeding programs for drought-prone regions. & COPY; 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

To probe this phenomenon, we conducted on-site investigations and measurements in the Nanxiaohegou catchment on the Loess Plateau to explore the effects of soil properties and vegetation on shallow loess landslides. Most of the loess landslides on vegetation-covered slopes were small scale with depths ranging from 0.3 m to 1.0 m, corresponding to the topsoil being saturated due to rainfall. Majority of shallow landslides occurred on herbage-covered area, which made up 69% of total landslides. There are significant differences in soil properties between the upper layer (root-soil composite) and the lower layer (loess) of the sliding surface. Our study demonstrated that root plays a leading role in landslide erosion and that the most adverse effect of vegetation on landslides is mainly the increase in soil moisture content in the shallow soil through the root zone creating preferential infiltration flow paths. There are remarkable differences in landslide erosion depths and landslide erosion intensities among different vegetation types. The landslide erosion depth and landslide erosion intensity increased linearly with increasing main root depth, indicating that the vegetation root depth determines the landslide erosion intensity during rainfall. Therefore, the potential implications of vegetation especially the herbage to promote landslide occurrences during rainfall should be given more attention in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Circular, arched, and egg-shaped sections are often used in non-pressure conduits in hydraulic engineering, irrigation, and sewerage works. However, equations governing the critical depth in various sections are complicated implicit transcendental equations. The function model is established for the geometric features of multiple sections using the mathematical transform method and while considering non-dimensional parameters. Then, revised PSO algorithms are implemented in MATLAB, and the right solution's formula for the critical depths in various non-pressure conduit sections is established through optimization. The error analysis results show that the established formula has broad applicability. The maximum relative errors of the formula for critical depths are less than 0.182%, 0.0629%, and 0.170% in circular, arched, and egg-shaped sections, respectively, which are more accurate than those of existing formulas; the form of the formula proposed in this work is also more compact than that of the existing formulas. The results of this research may be useful in design, operation, and maintenance in conduit engineering.																				2073-4441				OCT	2019	11	10							2124	10.3390/w11102124	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11102124													WOS:000495598400168

In this study, the Pb(II) biosorption behavior of Serratia Se1998 isolated from Pb-contaminated soil was investigated through macroscopic and microscopic techniques. A four discrete site non-electrostatic model fit the potentiometric titration data best, suggesting a distribution of phosphodiester, carboxyl, phosphoryl, and amino or hydroxyl groups on the cell surface. The presence of these functional groups was verified by the attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FFIR) spectroscopy, which also indicated that carboxyl and phosphoryl sites participated in Pb(II) binding simultaneously. The negative enthalpy (-9.11 kJ mol(-1) ) and large positive entropy (81.52 J mol(-1) K-1) of Pb(II) binding with the bacteria suggested the formation of inner-sphere complexes by an exothermic process. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis further indicated monodentate inner-sphere binding of Pb(II) through formation of C-O-Pb and P-O-Pb bonds. We inferred that C-O-Pb bonds formed on the flagellar surfaces, establishing a self-protective barrier against exterior metal stressors. This study has important implications for an improved understanding of metal-resistance mechanisms in wild bacteria and provides guidance for the construction of genetically engineered bacteria for remediation purposes.

The risk of soil salinization linked with high water tables could be better managed by using high growing capacity and deep-rooted phreatophytic vegetation via the 'biodrainage' approach. We evaluated the impacts of short rotation willow (SRW; Salix dasyclados Wimm.) plantation on soil and groundwater salinity linked to shallow GWT fluctuations and compared with adjacent annual crop (AC) and pasture (PA) in a field experiment. Groundwater salinity (ECgw) along with depth to GWT and soil salinity (ECsoil at 0-60 cm depth) were measured along transects within each land-use practice in two Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) wetland sites (A and B). The variations in ECgw were significant (p < 0.05) across land-uses; however, inconsistent in both sites. The positive correlation with ECgw, ECsoil, and total dissolved salts (TDS) indicated higher salinity and salt accumulation with increased depth to GWT in both sites. The ECsoil varied significantly (p < 0.05) among land-use practices; however, land-use patterns were not consistent in both sites. Throughout the experimentation, site B consistently exhibited higher ECsoil (two-fold) than site A. We observed a decreasing inclination in ECsoil with increasing SRW biomass at both depths (i.e., 0-30 and 30-60 cm) and vice versa. This study refines our knowledge of SRW plantation-linked potential hydrological alteration and its implication on salinity, which provides a critical context for degraded marginal riparian wetland soil management in the PPR.

InDel markers: An extended marker resource for molecular breeding in chickpea	PLOS ONE												Chickpea is one of the most important food legumes that holds the key to meet rising global food and nutritional demand. In order to deploy molecular breeding approaches in crop improvement programs, user friendly and cost effective marker resources remain prerequisite. The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has resulted in the generation of several thousands of markers as part of several large scale genome sequencing and re-sequencing initiatives. Very recently, PCR based Insertion-deletions (InDels) are becoming a popular gel based genotyping solution because of their co-dominant, inexpensive, and highly polymorphic nature. With an objective to expand marker resources for genomics assisted breeding (GAB) in chickpea, whole genome re-sequencing data generated on five parental lines of one interspecific (ICC 4958 x PI 489777) and two intra-specific (ICC 283 x ICC 8261 and ICC 4958 x ICC 1882) mapping populations, were used for identification of InDels. A total of 231,658 InDels were identified using Dindel software with default parameters. Further, a total of 8,307 InDels with. 20 bp size were selected for development of gel based markers, of which primers could be designed for 7,523 (90.56%) markers. On average, markers appeared at a frequency of 1,038 InDels/LG with a maximum number of markers on CaLG04 (1,952 InDels) and minimum on CaLG08 (360 InDels). In order to validate these InDels, a total of 423 primer pairs were randomly selected and tested on the selected parental lines. A high amplification rate of 80% was observed ranging from 46.06 to 58.01% polymorphism rate across parents on 3% agarose gel. This study clearly reflects the usefulness of available sequence data for the development of genome-wide InDels in chickpea that can further contribute and accelerate a wide range of genetic and molecular breeding activities in chickpea.

This study aims to properly examine the biases of urbanization in the observed sunshine duration series from 1987 to 2016 and explore the related driving factors based on five meteorological stations around Hangzhou City, China. The results inferred a weak and insignificant decreasing trend in annual mean sunshine duration (-0.09 h/d decade(-1)) from 1987 to 2016 in the Hangzhou region, indicating a solar dimming tendency. However, large differences in sunshine duration changes between rural, suburban, and urban stations were observed on the annual, seasonal, and monthly scales, which can be attributed to the varied urbanization effects. Using rural stations as a baseline, we found evident urbanization effects on the annual mean sunshine duration series at urban and suburban stations-particularly in the period of 2002-2016. The effects of urbanization on the annual mean sunshine duration trends during 1987-2016 were estimated to be -0.16 and -0.35 h/d decade(-1) at suburban and urban stations, respectively. For urban stations, the strongest urbanization effect was observed in summer (-0.46 h/d decade(-1)) on the seasonal scale and in June (-0.63 h/d decade(-1)) on the monthly scale. The notable negative impact of urbanization on local solar radiation changes was closely related to the changes in anthropogenic pollutions, which largely reduced the estimations of solar radiation trends in the Hangzhou region. This result highlights the necessity to carefully consider urbanization impacts when analyzing the trend in regional solar radiation and designing cities for sustainable development.

In this study, 28 nationally approved maize hybrids were evaluated across 24 different climatic conditions for two consecutive years (2018-2019). The purpose of this study was to select high-yield with stable genotypes and identify important agronomic traits for maize breeding program improvement. The results of this study showed that the genotype x environment interaction effects of the 12 evaluated agronomic traits was highly significant (P < 0.001). We introduced a novel multi-trait genotype-ideotype distance index (MGIDI) to select genotypes based on multiple agronomic traits. The selection process exhibited by this method is unique and easy to understand, so the MGIDI index will have more and more important applications in future (please indicate what does it mean MET before abbreviating it) METs research. The genotypes selected by the MGIDI index were G22, G10, G12 and G1 as the high yielding and stable genotypes. The parents of these selected genotypes have the ability to play a greater role as the basic germplasm in the breeding process. A new form of (please indicate what does it mean GGE before abbreviating it) GGE technician, geno-type*yield*trait (GYT) biplot, based on multiple traits for genotypes selection was also applied in this study. The GYT biplot ranked genotypes by combining grain yield with other evaluated agronomic traits, and displayed the distribution of their traits, namely strengths and weaknesses.																			0031-9457	1851-5657					2022	91	1					57	81		10.32604/phyton.2022.017308	http://dx.doi.org/10.32604/phyton.2022.017308													WOS:000701521500006
J	Sun, L; Liu, YF; Wang, XT; Liu, Y; Wu, GL				Sun, Lei; Liu, Yi-Fan; Wang, Xiangtao; Liu, Yu; Wu, Gao-Lin			Soil nutrient loss by gully erosion on sloping alpine steppe in the northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	CATENA												Global warming and grazing activities have exacerbated soil erosion in alpine steppe. Gully erosion is a great threat to land degradation in alpine steppe ecosystem. Yet, little is known about the in-situ effects of gully erosion on soil properties at cross section and lengthwise position in alpine steppe ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Here, we used a paired sampling method to compare the soil properties of two erosion gullies (shallow gully and deep gully) at cross section and lengthwise position. The results showed that gully erosion generally induced serious soil nutrient loss and differed between shallow gully and deep gully. However, available phosphorus variation (Delta AP) showed an increase both in shallow gully (from -0.86% to 17.17%) and deep gully (from 8.00% to 45.60%), and pH variation (Delta pH) showed an increase (from -3.40% to 9.01%) in the deep gully. Soil sand content and soil nutrient properties were more sensitive to gully erosion in different cross sections than that in different lengthwise positions, which indicated that the depth of erosion gullies largely determining soil nutrients loss in erosion gullies. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to the ecological restoration of deep erosion gullies to control soil loss and reduce the loss of soil nutrients. These results may conducive to offer a theoretical guidance to achieve the combined goal of gully erosion regulation of alpine steppe ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

J	Han, QG; Ding, YX; Peng, SZ				Han, Qinggong; Ding, Yongxia; Peng, Shouzhang			Sustainable and cost-effective vegetation restoration framework under climate change	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Although potential natural vegetation (PNV) information can be used as references in revegetation projects, previous studies have largely ignored the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of revegetation in light of climate change and funding requirements. To address these issues, this study proposes a sustainable and cost-effective vegetation restoration framework based on the growing potential index (GPI, i.e., normalized gross primary productivity) of the PNV type, mitigating adverse effects of climate change. The framework is simulated with a dynamic vegetation model using China's Loess Plateau (LP) as a case study. The results show that: (1) Among the PNV types, temperate steppe occupied 73.2% of the LP, followed by temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest with 22.3% and temperate evergreen coniferous forest with 3.9%. Several conversions occurred among the PNV types from current to future periods, implying that future climate change will strongly disturb PNV patterns. (2) The GPI of PNV type during 2001-2020 displayed distinct spatial heterogeneity within its pattern; although the GPI of PNV type during 2081-2100 had similar spatial variation to GPI during 2001-2020, spatial statistic information of GPI during 2001-2020 and 2081-2100 showed large differences, suggesting that the growth status of PNV type will be largely affected by future climate change. (3) To mitigate the effects of climate change on vegetation restoration, a PNV pattern undisturbed by climate change from 2021 to 2100 was identified, accounting for 77.8-68.76%, which can be considered as a reference to ensure sustainability. The GPI of the undisturbed PNV types showed a progressive decrease from southeast to northwest and from low to high altitudes. Our results can be used to plan sustainable and cost-effective revegetation projects especially for areas with high growing potential for undisturbed PNV types and may provide insights into other ecological restoration projects globally.

The non-stationary case of the Maxwell-Garnett theory: growth of nanomaterials (2D gold flakes) in solution	NANOSCALE ADVANCES												The solution-based growth mechanism is a common process for nanomaterials. The Maxwell-Garnett theory (for light-matter interactions) describes the solution growth in an effective medium, homogenized by a mean electromagnetic field, which applies when materials are in a stationary phase. However, the charge transitions (inter- and intra-transitions) during the growth of nanomaterials lead to a non-stationary phase and are associated with time-dependent permittivity constant transitions (for nanomaterials). Therefore, time-independence in the standard Maxwell-Garnett theory is lost, resulting in time dependence, epsilon(i)(t). This becomes important when the optical spectrum of a solution needs to be deconvoluted at different reaction times since each peak represents a specific charge/energy transfer with a specific permittivity constant. Based on this, we developed a time-resolved deconvolution approach, f(t) proportional to epsilon(i)(t), which led us to identify the transitions (inter- and intra-transitions) with their dominated growth regimes. Two gold ion peaks were precisely measured (322 nm and 367 nm) for the inter-transition, and three different polyaniline oxidation states (PAOS) for the intra-transition, including A (372 nm), B (680 nm), and C (530 nm). In the initial reaction time regime (0-90 min), the permittivity constant of gold was found to be highly dependent on time, i.e. f(E) proportional to epsilon(i)(t), since charge transfer takes place from the PAOS to gold ions (i.e. inter-transition leads to a reduction reaction). In the second time regime (90-180 min), the permittivity constant of gold changes as the material deforms from 3D to 2D (f(S) proportional to epsilon(3D-2D)), i.e. intra-transition (combined with thermal reduction). Our approach provides a new framework for the time-dependent modelling of (an)isotropic solutions of other nanomaterials and their syntheses.

Is wetter better? Exploring agriculturally-relevant rainfall characteristics over four decades in the Sahel	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The semi-arid Sahel is a global hotspot for poverty and malnutrition. Rainfed agriculture is the main source of food and income, making the well-being of rural population highly sensitive to rainfall variability. Studies have reported an upward trend in annual precipitation in the Sahel since the drought of the 1970s and early '80s, yet farmers have questioned improvements in conditions for agriculture, suggesting that intraseasonal dynamics play a crucial role. Using high-resolution daily precipitation data spanning 1981-2017 and focusing on agriculturally-relevant areas of the Sahel, we re-examined the extent of rainfall increase and investigated whether the increases have been accompanied by changes in two aspects of intraseasonal variability that have relevance for agriculture: rainy season duration and occurrence of prolonged dry spells during vulnerable crop growth stages. We found that annual rainfall increased across 56% of the region, but remained largely the same elsewhere. Rainy season duration increased almost exclusively in areas with upward trends in annual precipitation (23% of them). Association between annual rain and dry spell occurrence was less clear: increasing and decreasing frequencies of false starts (dry spells after first rains) and post-floral dry spells (towards the end of the season) were found to almost equal extent both in areas with positive and those with no significant trend in annual precipitation. Overall, improvements in at least two of the three intraseasonal variables (and no declines in any) were found in 10% of the region, while over a half of the area experienced declines in at least one intraseasonal variable, or no improvement in any. We conclude that rainfall conditions for agriculture have improved overall only in scattered areas across the Sahel since the 1980s, and increased annual rainfall is only weakly, if at all, associated with changes in the agriculturally-relevant intraseasonal rainfall characteristics.

Yield, nutrient uptake, and economic return of faba bean (<i>Vicia</i> <i>faba</i> <i>L</i>.) in calcareous soil as affected by compost types	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH												Compost application is a promising approach to improve soil fertility and the sustainability of plant production, but different types of compost may vary in their efficiency. A field experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of traditional compost, vermicompost, and material composted with additional effective microorganisms (EM) on faba bean yield and related properties. The compost treatments were applied at three nitrogen levels (18, 27, and 36 kg ha(-1)) and compared to mineral fertilizer alone or in combination with compost in a two-factor randomized complete block design with four replicates. The economic effects of the different composts were assessed using partial budget analysis. All three composts resulted in significantly higher grain and biomass yields, as well as nutrient uptake into grain compared to mineral fertilizer. This was reflected in a higher number of nodules and higher residual soil nitrogen in the compost treatments. However, EM and vermicompost were most efficient, with a yield of approximately 3.6 and 3.45 t ha(-1), respectively, compared to traditional compost with a yield of 3.1 t. Similar results were found for other investigated properties. The economic analysis revealed that EM compost application at medium and high nitrogen rates was the most profitable among the treatments, with marginal rates of return varying between approximately 790 and 2800%.																			2666-1543					DEC	2021	6								100237	10.1016/j.jafr.2021.100237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafr.2021.100237		NOV 2021											WOS:000746008200040

Information on tree structure is needed at some points in the process to assess the appropriateness of forest management. The objectives are to examine whether the Structure from Motion (SfM)-based photogrammetry can be used to derive the forest structural parameters, and how the tree structural parameters can vary by location. In this study, the possible applicability of low-cost SfM-based photogrammetry was evaluated for forest management and conservation purposes in the Adi Zaboy watershed of the Northern Ethiopian highlands. In the watershed, dwarf Acacia etbaica was sparsely distributed. Consequently, the full three-dimensional point clouds of the individual trees were generated, which provided a wide variety of tree structural parameters in a non-destructive manner. The R-2 values for tree height, canopy width, and stump diameter were 0.936, 0.891, and 0.808, respectively, and the corresponding RMSE values were 0.128 m, 0.331 m, and 0.886 cm. In addition, differences in forest structure and composition were caused by differences in the environment. The SfM-based photogrammetry would provide fundamental information to meet the demand of sustainable forest management from a morphological point of view, especially in forests of Ethiopian highlands.					birhane, emiru/JBJ-0779-2023	birhane, emiru/0000-0002-8644-5961														2071-1050				MAY	2021	13	9							5282	10.3390/su13095282	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13095282													WOS:000650855000001

This study aims to assess the direction and intensity of PSF, determine the main factors influencing it, and interpret the ecological significance of PSF in companion species within the context of grassland community succession. Three typical companion species, namely Artemisia sacrorum, Artemisia capillaris, and Artemisia giraldii, were planted in soils at three grassland community succession stages (early, middle, and late) on the Loess Plateau. Our results indicate that during both plant growth periods, the shoot biomass of A. sacrorum, A. capillaris, and A. giraldii in early- and late-stage soils was higher than that in the middle-stage soil, suggesting consistent growth of the three companion species during the two growth periods. However, plant growth simultaneously led to a reduction in soil nutrient content and microbial biomass, resulting in an overall decrease in the biomass of the three species, indicating a negative PSF effect in companion species. In conclusion, the negative PSF observed in all three associated species explains the temporary dominance of companion species during succession. This study enhances our understanding of the mechanisms driving PSF in community succession.

In this study, amine-modified lignin (AL) was prepared from industrial alkali lignin (L) for phosphate recovery from water bodies, and then the recovered phosphorus-rich aminated lignin (AL-P) was used as a slow-release N and P fertilizer. Batch adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption process was consistent with the Pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir model. In addition, ion competition and actual aqueous adsorption experiments showed that AL had good adsorption selectivity and removal capacity. The adsorption mechanism included electrostatic adsorption, ionic ligand exchange and cross -linked addition reaction. In the aqueous release experiments, the rate of nitrogen release was constant and the release of phosphorus followed a Fickian diffusion mechanism. Soil column leaching experiments showed that the release of N and P from AL-P in soil followed the Fickian diffusion mechanism.

However, their role in drought resistance has never been studied. In order to investigate the possible role of (Z)-3-hexeny-1-yl acetate (Z-3-HAC, a type of green leaf volatile), various physiology experiments were performed to understand the physiological mechanisms of Z-3-HAC in alleviating wheat drought stress. Drought-resistant wheat seedlings were primed with 100 mu M Z-3-HAC at the four-leaf stage before drought treatment. Morphological analysis showed that the primed seedlings grew better and showed higher biomass accumulation in both shoots and roots under drought stress. Additionally, exogenous Z-3-HAC significantly increased the total root length, total root surface area, and total root volume of the seedlings under drought stress. In primed seedlings, physiological measurements showed that the relative water content (RWC), net photosynthetic rate (P-n), stomatal conductance (G(s)), transpiration rate (T-r), maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) (F-v/F-m), photochemical activity of PSII (F-v'/F-m'), total chlorophyll content, activities of antioxidant enzymes, and osmolyte accumulation were higher than the control under drought conditions. Furthermore, relative electrolyte conductivity (REC), intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i), reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were significantly lower than the non-primed seedlings. Lastly, principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that Z-3-HAC protected wheat seedlings against damage from drought stress mainly through antioxidant and osmoregulatory systems. This study opens a new field of Z-3-HAC application, and provides a new opportunity to improve wheat drought resistance.																			0167-6903	1573-5087				DEC	2022	98	3					477	490		10.1007/s10725-022-00855-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-022-00855-4		AUG 2022											WOS:000836148800002

Perovskite: Name Puzzle and German-Russian Odyssey of Discovery	HELVETICA CHIMICA ACTA												Today the term 'perovskite' is used to designate the crystalline structure of a wide variety of ABX(3) ionic compounds. However, historically this name was used for a specific material, having been coined for a mineral, calcium titanate (CaTiO3). This mineral was discovered in the Ural Mountains, Russia. The first sample of the mineral was transferred from Saint Petersburg to Berlin in 1839 by the Russian mineralogist Alexander Kammerer, who gave the sample for further investigation to the German mineralogist and crystallographer Gustav Rose. Rose determined its properties and chemical composition and named the mineral after the Russian politician and mineralogist Lev Perovski. The present essay describes the background of this discovery as well as the life stories of the personalities involved.

J	Zhang, ZD; Huang, MB; Zhao, XF; Wu, LH				Zhang Zhongdian; Huang Mingbin; Zhao Xiaofang; Wu Lianhai			Adjustments of leaf traits and whole plant leaf area for balancing water supply and demand in <i>Robinia</i> <i>pseudoacacia</i> under different precipitation conditions on the Loess Plateau	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												The adjustments of plant traits for balancing water supply and demand are critical for keeping the survival of forests under drought stress. In this study, we aimed to determine the long-term adjustments of leaf traits and whole plant leaf area (PLA) in Robinia pseudoacacia trees under different precipitation conditions, and to provide physiological information for modelling. We characterized the temporal changes of plant traits with simulated different precipitation conditions using three levels of water supply in a controlled growth chamber. The results indicated that increasing transpiration with R. pseudoacacia growth leaded to a decline in soil moisture under each precipitation conditions. As drought progressed, leaves exhibited a coordinated increase in vein and stomatal densities, higher drought tolerance by increasing cell wall elasticity, and higher water storage capacitance. After 60 days, leaf traits were similar among the treatments while PLA decreased considerably with decreasing water supply. The field observation along a precipitation gradient indicated that PLA decreased by 64% as mean annual precipitation declined from 645.9 mm to 421.9 mm, while leaf traits did not exhibit marked differences among different sites. The variation in PLA along the precipitation gradient could be well estimated with the optimal PLA calculated by long-term simulations of soil water balance. In summary, increasing transpiration with plant growth induced similar patterns of soil desiccation under different precipitation conditions, which further resulted in the convergence in leaf traits. The adjustment of PLA achieved an optimal value to maximize plant growth and to prevent severe drought stress by balancing the water supply and demand. These results provided a way to fill the gap between experiments and modelling studies for large-scale predictions of plant traits, and should be helpful for the sustainable management of plantation forests in the Loess Plateau.

J	Xie, QY; Li, JP				Xie, Qingyan; Li, Jianping			Effect of Indian Ocean-Pacific SST Pattern in Autumn on Winter Wheat ClimaticYield in the North China Plain in the Following Year and a Possible Mechanism	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Ensuring stable crop yield increases to meet rising demand is an important issue globally, particularly when accounting for climate change. In this study, using observations, reanalysis datasets, and the Hodrick and Prescott filter method, we find that changes in a distinct pattern of Indian Ocean-Pacific five-pole (IPFP) SST (sea surface temperature) are strongly linked to the ensuing year's winter wheat climatic yield (the part of yield that fluctuation caused by climatic factors change) in the North China Plain (NCP), which is the main production region of winter wheat in China. Here we define a normalized IPFP index (IPFPI) and demonstrate that the autumn IPFPI (1948-2014) is well correlated with the ensuing year's winter wheat climatic yield (1949-2015), particularly for October (r= 0.69; n= 67; P < 0.001). A composite analysis shows that the October IPFP is correlated with sowing-period and emergence-period climate factors in the NCP. When the October IPFP is in a positive phase, the atmosphere geopotential height fields and water vapor flux are bebefitial to rainfall formation in NCP, and the precipitation and soil moisture are higher in NCP and benefit winter wheat growth, thus increasing the climatic yield. In addition, accumulated rainfall and soil water content might influence winter wheat growth from sowing and emergence (autumn) to the returning green stage (following spring).

Soil water recovery with respect to the soil water content (SWC) following the occurrence of a DSL (i.e., DSL-SWC recovery time) and the effect of the number of planting years of restorative vegetation on soil water recovery have received little attention. The aim of this study was to investigate soil water dynamics after vegetation conversion (include three fields of converting cropland with soybean or millet into alfalfa land, three fields of converting alfalfa land into soybean land or four fields of converting peashrub land into natural grassland) in the Liudaogou watershed in a water-wind erosion crisscross region in the Loess Plateau, China. With this aim in mind, we conducted in-situ field experiments for 3 or 5 years and continuously monitored the SWC in a 0-5 m or 0-8 m profile. The results showed that the SWC increased drastically after alfalfa was converted to soybean, especially after consecutive wet year when the SWC of 0-800 cm profile was recharged up to 0.16 cm(3) cm(-3), which means the DSL-SWC in the 0-800 cm profile recovered within 5 years. The DSL-SWC of the profile improved obviously within 3 years after peashrub was converted to natural grass. The SWC of the two fields was 0.16 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.15 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively. The SWC depletion time was 6.1, 7.5, and 8.4 years in the three fields converted from cropland to alfalfa. Based on our findings, the number of alfalfa planting years should not exceed 8 years. However, planting years of peashrub needs further study because it has excellent drought resistance and a long root system. Taking the advantages and disadvantages of two restoration management methods into account, alfalfa-crop rotations and natural grasslands are the two best choices for ecological restoration in the Loess Plateau, China.

Photosynthesis and nutrient-use efficiency in response to N and P addition in three dominant grassland species on the semiarid Loess Plateau	PHOTOSYNTHETICA												Understanding the ecophysiological and nutrient-use strategies of dominant species is important for clarifying plant growth and an ecological process in their community under unbalanced N and P inputs. This study investigated effects of N and P addition [main plot: 0, 25, 50, and 100 kg(N) ha(-1) year(-1); subplot: 0, 20, 40, and 80 kg(P) ha(-1) year(-1)] on leaf N and P contents (LNCa and LPCa), photosynthetic capacity (P-Nmax) and photosynthetic N- and P-use efficiencies (PNUE and PPUE) in three species (Stipa bungeana, Bothriochloa ischaemum, and Lespedeza davurica) in a semiarid grassland in China. At the assessing time, N addition alone significantly increased LNCa and LNCa/LPCa ratio of Stipa bungeana (C-3 grass) only, while P-Nmax increased significantly in all three species. Under N addition, P addition caused significantly lower LNCa, but higher PNUE and PNmax in Bothriochloa ischaemum (C-4 grass) and Stipa bungeana. The LNCa, P-Nmax, and PNUE of Lespedeza davurica (C-3 legume) increased significantly after P addition regardless of N application. The LNCa/LPCa for optimum PNUE changed with species. The P-Nmax and PNUE of Bothriochloa ischaemum and Stipa bungeana had a peak when LNCa/LPCa attained similar to 11 and similar to 20. Lespedeza davurica tended to retain greater P-Nmax and PNUE at lower LNCa/LPCa. Our results indicated that the C3 grass was more sensitive to N and P addition than the C-4 grass and the C-3 legume in terms of leaf N and P contents and P-Nmax. Such interspecific variations of nutrient use in response to N and/or P addition are favorable for maintaining the diversity and the stability of the grassland community.

J	Liu, DD; She, DL; Mu, XM				Liu, Dongdong; She, Dongli; Mu, Xingmin			Water flow and salt transport in bare saline-sodic soils subjected to evaporation and intermittent irrigation with saline/distilled water	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Sustainable development of coastal reclamation areas is severely restricted by the high soil salt content and irrigation water salinity. We investigated the water flow and salt transport in open soil columns subjected to evaporation and intermittent irrigation with saline/distilled water by long-term wetting-drying cycles. The study included two different soil materials (silt loam and silty clay) with four to five soil sodicity levels. Three groups of experiments with three replicates were imposed: silt loam x 5 sodicity level, silty clay x 5 sodicity level, and 2 soil textures x 5 irrigation water qualities. Three irrigations were conducted in Spring to early Autumn (March 2, June 30, and September 8), whereas the soil columns were subjected to the natural evaporation without rainfall throughout the period September 9 to March 1. The average daily soil evaporation rate significantly decreased with the soil clay content (pr = -0.55; P < 0.001), soil exchangeable sodium percentage (pr = -0.54; P < 0.001), and irrigation water salinity (pr = -0.32; P < 0.001). The soil properties were the major factors responsible for controlling evaporation, whereas the irrigation water salinity was the less important factor. Soil salt distribution was significantly affected by the soil clay content (pr = 0.82; P < 0.001), soil depth (pr = 0.68; P < 0.05), soil exchangeable sodium percentage (pr = 0.85; P < 0.001), and irrigation water salinity (pr = 0.37; P < 0.001). The magnitudes of the steady-state infiltration rate i(c) and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks were largely reduced by wetting-drying cycles, especially for the silty clay. Understanding water flow and salt transport in saline-sodic soils subjected to evaporation and intermittent irrigation with saline/distilled water is important for improving the soil desalination project and strategy.

This study aimed to analyze the effects of mosaic-pattern shrub patch size on runoff and sedimentation in a wind-water erosion crisscross region. The influence of shrub patch size on runoff and sedimentation, and on several soil physical and vegetation factors was evaluated in a sandy Chinese landscape. Based upon the canopy diameter of Artemisia ordosica, a xerophytic shrub, three different patch sizes were set as the treatments, such as small (empty set < 60 cm), medium (60 < empty set < 160 cm) and large (empty set > 160 cm) shrub patches. Bare land served as control conditions. Three runoff plots were established for each shrub size, and runoff (Q) and sediment (SY) yields were monitored under natural rainfall conditions. The results indicated that rainfall distribution was uneven in the study area. Low-intensity (0-5 mm/h) and short-duration (0-5 h) rainfall events accounted for 82.6% and 71.7% of all events, respectively, during the 6-month test period, from May to October 2016. Linear regression indicated that Q and SY increased with increasing rainfall depth at the slope scale. The impact of rainfall erosion on bare land was the greatest. Compared with control plots, Q and SY reduction owing to the small, medium, and large shrub patches was 19.7% and 49.3%, 31.4% and 62.4%, and 35.9% and 94.9%, respectively. These results confirmed the different effects of shrub patches of different sizes on soil quality, runoff and sediment reduction. Besides, this study suggested that shrub patches could modify soil microhabitats on sandy soils, reducing the soil erosion rates and as well as favoring vegetation regeneration.

AGRONOMY-BASEL												Pigeonpea is one of the important pulse crops grown in many states of India and plays a major role in sustainable food and nutritional security for the smallholder farmers. In order to overcome the productivity barrier the Translational Pigeonpea Genomics Consortium (TPGC) was established, representing research institutes from six different states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh) of India. To enhance pigeonpea productivity and production the team has been engaged in deploying modern genomics approaches in breeding and popularizing modern varieties in farmers' fields. For instance, new genetic stock has been developed for trait mapping and molecular breeding initiated for enhancing resistance to fusarium wilt and sterility mosaic disease in 11 mega varieties of pigeonpea. In parallel, genomic segments associated with cleistogamous flower, shriveled seed, pods per plant, seeds per pod, 100 seed weight, and seed protein content have been identified. Furthermore, 100 improved lines were evaluated for yield and desirable traits in multi-location trials in different states. Furthermore, a total of 303 farmers' participatory varietal selection (FPVS) trials have been conducted in 129 villages from 15 districts of six states with 16 released varieties/hybrids. Additionally, one line (GRG 152 or Bheema) from multi-location trials has been identified by the All India Coordinated Research Project on Pigeonpea (AICRP-Pigeonpea) and released for cultivation by the Central Variety Release Committee (CVRC). In summary, the collaborative efforts of several research groups through TPGC is accelerating genetics gains in breeding plots and is expected to deliver them to pigeonpea farmers to enhance their income and improve livelihood.

Compared with biophysical factors, the effects of socio-economic factors on soil erosion have not been well investigated. Here, taking two prefectures (Yan'an and Qingyang) with different socio-economic conditions and ecological restoration intensity on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) as a case, we combined the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), and gray relation analysis to explore the response of soil erosion to socio-economic development. Our results showed that Grain for Green Program (GGP) has effectively controlled soil erosion and increased the vegetation coverage of the study area. For Yan'an, the vegetation coverage was increased by 6.2% and erosion modulus was decreased by 33.9% in 2015 compared with that in 1995. The differences in industrial structure and agricultural input led to different responses of soil erosion to socio-economic development. Economic development and agricultural input accelerated soil erosion in Qingyang but inhibited soil erosion in Yan'an due to different development strategies. Moreover, the increase of the gray relation grade between socio-economic factors and soil erosion in Yan'an indicates that soil erosion is easier to be controlled by the development of the socio-economy. The results indicate that the triple-win situation of economic development, vegetation restoration, and soil conservation can be realized by adjusting the economic structure, strengthening ecological restoration, and agricultural investment. This research emphasizes the important effect of socio-economic development on soil erosion and provides a reference for soil erosion control and ecological restoration for regions suffering from severe soil erosion.

To date, there is not enough comprehensive research on nutrient stock and stoichiometric characteristics of each tissue among different tree species in the semi-arid region on the Loess Plateau. So, six dominant tree species were selected to estimate the forest biomass by allometric equation and to analyze the effects of tissue and species on biomass allocation and nutrient stock by variance analysis in our study. Results showed that forest biomass, nutrient concentration, nutrient stock, and stoichiometric characteristics varied with tissue and species. Betula platyphylla and Pinus tabulaeformis had high total biomass while Populus davidiana had the least total biomass, and the biomass allocation of each tissue generally followed the order of stem > branch > root > foliage. The weighted mean concentrations of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) changed from 432.67, respectively. The relatively high nutrient stocks were observed in Pinus tabulaeformis and Betula platyphylla across organs and in stem across species. The C:N and C:P ratios were higher in stem and root than those in branch and foliage for each species, while the effects of tissue on N:P varied with species. Overall, the N:P ranged from 7.92 for stem (Larix principis-rupprechtii) to 22.18 for foliage (Populus davidiana). Therefore, Pinus tabulaeformis and Betula platyphylla can increase effectively nutrient fixation capacity in the semi-arid region on the Loess Plateau. Also, N or P limitation of tree growth in this region varied with species.

According to the artificial rainfall experiments with a constant rainfall intensity of 90 mm/h and different rainfall duration (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min), the traits of soil PO43-, K+, and Br- release and transport from soil to surface runoff on the loess slope were analysed, and a model describing the chemical concentration change in surface runoff under soil erosion conditions was developed. The runoff coefficient quickly increased in 15 min or so, and then it was stable in the range of 0.60-0.85. The sediment intensity decreased in 30 min and soon increased after severe sheet erosion occurred on the slope. The concentration curve of Br- in surface runoff can be divided into two stages, quickly decreasing in the initial 30 min after the surface runoff occurred, and then stable. The concentration curve of PO43- and K+ in surface runoff can be divided into three stages, quickly decreasing like Br- was decreasing, then stable, and increasing after severe sheet erosion began. Compared with the exponential function, the power function was found more suitable for fitting the change in chemicals in runoff with unsaturated soil; while neither of them could well fit the PO43- and K+ concentration change after severe erosion occurred. The transport of chemicals under complex soil erosion conditions seems to be a dynamic release process between surface runoff and sediment. Based on the convection-dispersion mechanism and desorption kinetics, the polynomial model under soil erosion conditions was created. For adsorbed PO43- and K+, it is more suitable to simulate that process than the power function, while it is not so good for mobile Br-.

This study was conducted for three consecutive growing seasons using two genotypes with contrasting plant architectures as the materials, the upright-leafed compact type Jing 411 and the flat-leafed loose type Jinmai 47. The population-scale transpiration (PT) and soil evaporation (E) were partitioned from the evapotranspiration (ET) using micro-lysimeters, and the canopy traits population density and the canopy temperature depression (CTD) were also monitored during the period from the jointing to early grain filling stage-the largest water requirement period of wheat crops. Jinmai 47 showed a lower E than Jing 411, but a similar PT and ET, though it had a higher population density at the sowing density. The total evapotranspiration (TET) for the whole growing season was also similar in the two genotypes. This indicated that Jinmai 47 performed better in water conservation than Jing 411. With a similar PT and TET, however, Jinmai 47 showed a rather larger CTD and a significantly higher grain yield than Jing 411. If the higher population density and higher leaf net photosynthetic rate could explain its higher grain yield, the higher leaf stomotal conductance and transpiration rate and the higher population density could not explain the similar PT, ET and TET to Jing 411. Presumably, the involvement of the plant architecture disrupted the original higher transpiration-larger CTD relation, and broke up the prevailing saving water-losing yield concept. Thus, the study might suggest the important water saving value of the flat-leafed loose architecture in wheat crops and demonstrate the possibility of conserving irrigation water without causing serious grain yield loss by taking advantage of the distinct plant architecture to establish an appropriate population structure.

J	Chai, XJ; Li, YL; Shang, F				Chai, Xiaojun; Li, Yanlin; Shang, Fei			Numerical Study on Metal Transverse Flow Law and Model of Rolled Strip under Variable Specification in Hot Rolling	METALS												The research on metal transverse flow under variable specification is of great significance for shape calculation and control in hot strip rolling. The finite element software ABAQUS 2016 is used to establish the elastic-plastic deformation model of a hot rolled strip to study the metal transverse flow. The edge transverse strain epsilon e and center transverse strain epsilon c are introduced to characterize metal transverse flow and calculate the strip flatness. The effect on epsilon e, epsilon c and the flatness increment of similarity of profile under different widths, thicknesses and reduction rates is simulated and calculated. The results show that the change in similarity of profile has a linear influence on epsilon e and epsilon c. The strip has the ability of flatness self-correction due to the metal transverse flow. The ksc of the strip with B = 700 mm is 0.87, which is significantly greater than the 0.45 ksc value of the strip with B = 2100 mm. Priority can be given to ensure the crown requirements during narrow strip rolling. The ksc of the strip with H = 50 mm is 0.45, which is higher than the 0.22 ksc value of the strip with H = 6 mm, and the ksc of the strip with epsilon = 50% is 0.52, which is higher than 0.30 ksc value of the strip with epsilon = 10%. It is more reasonable to adjust the crown to a greater extent in the upstream stand to meet the requirement of both flatness and crown for the large entry thickness reduction rate and self-correction ability. A metal transverse flow prediction model based on the full test simulation results is established, which can meet the requirement of crown setting at the exit of each stand and the rapid calculation of online flatness control, and can further make the crown and flatness reach the target values at the finishing exit.																				2075-4701				NOV	2023	13	11							1876	10.3390/met13111876	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met13111876													WOS:001115375100001

Metabolic rate and ecological traits of ectoparasites: a case study with seven flea species from the Negev Desert	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												We studied the relationship between fleas' metabolic rate and their ecological traits, using data on standard metabolic rate (SMR), mean abundance, host specificity, and geographic range size in males and females of seven desert flea species. SMR was measured via mass-specific CO2 emission, whereas host specificity was measured as (a) the mean number of host species used by a flea per region in regions where this flea was recorded; (b) the total number of host species a flea exploited across its geographic range; and (c) the phylogenetic diversity of the flea's hosts. To control for confounding effects of phylogeny when analysing data on multiple species, we applied the Phylogenetic Generalised Least Squares (PGLS) model. We found that the only ecological trait significantly correlating with flea SMR was the phylogenetic diversity of hosts utilized by a flea across its geographic range. The strength of the association between SMR and host phylogenetic diversity was higher in male than in female fleas. We explain the relationship between flea SMR and their host specificity by the necessity of host-opportunistic species to compensate for the high energetic cost of neutralizing multiple defences from multiple hosts by increased SMR.																			0932-0113	1432-1955				OCT	2023	122	10					2317	2324		10.1007/s00436-023-07931-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-023-07931-2		JUL 2023						37522953					WOS:001037959500001
J	Liu, DD; She, DL				Liu, Dongdong; She, Dongli			The effect of fracture properties on preferential flow in carbonate-derived laterite from karst mountainous agroforestry lands	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Karst mountainous agroforestry significantly enhances the formation of soil fractures. However, there are still some uncertainties regarding the effects of these soil fractures on water flow in carbonate-derived laterite. Therefore, a series of laboratory column infiltration and blue dye-tracing experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of fracture burial depth (15, 25, 35 cm), configuration (V: "V" shape; 1: "vertical bar" shape) and inclusions (S: sand grain; R: rock fragment) on preferential flow processes in carbonate-derived laterite. The Green-Ampt model with effective hydraulic conductivity was applied to determine the hydraulic properties of soils containing fractures. The results show that the fracture configuration had a larger influence on the soil infiltration, while the responses of soil infiltration were not sensitive to the fracture burial depth. In the 1R15 treatment, the dye distribution was not uniform, as evidenced by two significantly different staining regions. All three parameters (dye coverage, uniform infiltration depth, and preferential flow fraction) to quantify the contribution of preferential flow showed that the preferential flow fraction was highest in the 1R15 treatment. Furthermore, Brilliant Blue was not a suitable quantitative tracer for water movement in carbonate-derived laterite that contains fractures. The effects of the fracture properties, including configuration and inclusions, on preferential flow cannot be neglected for karst mountainous agroforestry land management.

A diagnostic marker kit for Fusarium wilt and sterility mosaic diseases resistance in pigeonpea	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Fusarium wilt (FW) and sterility mosaic diseases (SMD) are key biotic constraints to pigeonpea production. Occurrence of these two diseases in congenial conditions is reported to cause complete yield loss in susceptible pigeonpea cultivars. Various studies to elucidate genomic architecture of the two traits have revealed significant marker-trait associations for use in breeding programs. However, these DNA markers could not be used effectively in genomics-assisted breeding for developing FW and SMD resistant varieties primarily due to pathogen variability, location or background specificity, lesser phenotypic variance explained by the reported QTL and cost-inefficiency of the genotyping assays. Therefore, in the present study, a novel approach has been used to develop a diagnostic kit for identification of suitable FW and SMD resistant lines. This kit was developed with 10 markers each for FW and SMD resistance. Investigation of the diversity of these loci has shown the role of different alleles in different resistant genotypes. Two genes (C.cajan_03691andC.cajan_18888) for FW resistance and four genes (C.cajan_07858, C.cajan_20995, C.cajan_21801andC.cajan_17341) for SMD resistance have been identified. More importantly, we developed a customized and cost-effective Kompetitive allele-specific PCR genotyping assay for the identified genes in order to encourage their downstream applications in pigeonpea breeding programs. The diagnostic marker kit developed here will offer great strength to pigeonpea varietal development program, since the resistance against these two diseases is essentially required for nominating an improved line in varietal release pipeline.

Do the pattern and strength of species associations in ectoparasite communities conform to biogeographic rules?	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												We tested whether biogeographic patterns characteristic of species diversity and composition may also apply to community assembly by investigating geographic variation in the pattern (PSA) (aggregation versus segregation) and strength of species associations (SSA) in flea and mite communities harbored by small mammalian hosts in Western Siberia. We asked whether (a) there is a relationship between latitude and PSA or SSA and (b) similarities in PSA or SSA follow a distance decay pattern or if they are better explained by variation in environmental factors (altitude, amount of vegetation, precipitation, and air temperature). We used a sign of a co-occurrence metric (the C-score) as an indicator of PSA and its absolute standardized value as a measure of SSA. We analyzed data using logistic and linear models, generalized dissimilarity modeling (GDM), and a logistic version of the multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM). The majority of the C-scores of the observed presence/absence matrices indicated a tendency to species aggregation rather than segregation. No effect of latitude on PSA or SSA was found. The dissimilarity in PSA was affected by environmental dissimilarity in mite compound communities only. A relatively large proportion of the deviance of spatial variation in SSA was explained by the GDMs in infracommunities, but not component communities, and in only three (of seven) and two (of eight) host species of fleas and mites, respectively. The best predictors of dissimilarity in SSA in fleas differed between host species, whereas the same factor (precipitation) was the best predictor of dissimilarity in SSA in mites. We conclude that PSA and SSA in parasite communities rarely conform to biogeographic rules. However, when a biogeographic pattern is detected, its manifestation differs among hosts and between ectoparasite taxa.

This paper aims to address this gap, and argues that it is necessary to take into account past state interventions and policies so as to thoroughly understand the drivers of land degradation problems in these parts of the country. Taking the case of Herero pastoralism as an example, the paper shows how a pre-colonial pastoral system keeping overgrazing at bay, but was radically transformed by the colonial state, and illustrates how current land degradation problems in the former Herero 'homelands' are intrinsically linked to past colonial interventions and policies. The analysis shows, however, that despite the calamities of colonialism and its legacies, key rangeland management practices of Herero pastoralism have not entirely disappeared, thus maintaining livestock rearing in the region as a viable way of life.

J	Kang, HL; Guo, MM; Wang, WL				Kang, Hongliang; Guo, Mingming; Wang, Wenlong			Ephemeral gully erosion in concentrated flow channels induced by rainfall and upslope inflow on steep loessial slopes	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Ephemeral gullies (EGs) play a crucial role in hydrological connectivity, soil erosion, and land degradation. However, little research has focused on flow hydraulics in concentrated flow channels and their effects on EG erosion on steep loessial slopes. A simulated experiment of rainfall (60-120 mm hr(-1)) and upslope inflow (0.45-2.25 m(2) hr(-1)) were conducted on concentrated flow channels with loess at 15 degrees-25 degrees slope gradients. The concentrated flow was turbulent and subcritical in most cases. The flow shear stress, stream power, and unit stream power in the concentrated flow channels varied from 32.65 to 109.40 N m(-2), 10.85 to 38.66 N m(-1) s(-1), and 0.08 to 0.16 m s(-1), respectively. The EG depth, width, and width-depth ratio varied within 14.8-24.6 cm, 18.5-33.8 cm, and 1.13-1.83, respectively. Moreover, the EG depth and width increased in a power function with the runoff rate (R-2 = 0.82-0.83; p < 0.01). The sediment yield rate (Ys) varied within 15.94-94.44 g m(-2) s(-1) under the different treatments and had a good linear relationship with the runoff rate (R-2 = 0.78; p < 0.01). Furthermore, the flow shear stress and stream power can be used to predict Ys by linear functions. The critical runoff rate and shear stress to initiate EG erosion were determined to be 0.09 m(3) hr(-1) and 2.66 N m(-2). However, the coefficient of determination for the linear relationship between Ys and shear stress was low (0.58). The results indicate that the flow shear stress mechanism might not be enough to explain sediment load variation for EG erosion, and headcut erosion mechanism should be taken into account.

On the use of air temperature and precipitation as surrogate predictors in soil respiration modelling	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Soil respiration (R-S), the soil-to-atmosphere CO2 flux that is a major component of the global carbon cycle, is strongly influenced by local soil temperature (T-soil) and water content (SWC). Regional to global-scale R-S modelling thus requires this information at local scales, but few high-quality, wall-to-wall (global) T-soil and SWC data exist. As a result, such modelling efforts commonly use air temperature (T-air) and monthly precipitation (P-m) as surrogate predictors, but their site-scale accuracy and potential bias are unknown. Here, we used monthly data from 880 sites across a wide variety of different environmental conditions (i.e., climate, ecosystem type, elevation, vegetation leaf habit and drainage conditions) to determine the suitability of T-air as a surrogate for T-soil, and data from 507 sites to examine the suitability of P-m as a surrogate for SWC. Site-specific linear and second-order exponential non-linear models were compared using model evaluation metrics (i.e., slope, p-value of slope, root mean square error [RMSE], index of agreement and model efficiency). We found that T-soil and T-air are highly correlated and explain similar R-S variability. In contrast, P-m is not a good surrogate for SWC, even though P-m explains a similar amount of R-S variability to SWC. The wide variability in the site-specific relationships between R-S and SWC means that no single relationship can be used for large-scale modelling. The results from this study support the use of T-air in continental-to-global scale R-S models, and highlight the urgent need for continental-to-global scale SWC datasets for the modelling and evaluation of future soil carbon dynamics under global climate change. Highlights The accuracy of air temperature and precipitation as surrogates in global soil respiration modelling is unknown. Monthly air temperature and soil temperature are strongly correlated and explained similar amounts of variability in soil respiration. Relationships between precipitation and soil water content are extremely variable by region, thus precipitation is a poor surrogate in global modelling. There is a need for accurate multiscale soil moisture datasets to evaluate future soil carbon dynamics.

However, little is known about the response of ecological stoichiometry to plant growth. In this study, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) concentrations were evaluated in plant tissues (trees, shrubs, and herbs), litter, and soil of young (<= 40-year-old), middle-aged (41-60-year-old), near-mature (61-80-year-old), and mature (81-120-year-old) Quercus secondary forests on the Loess Plateau, China. Vegetation composition, plant biomass, and C stock were determined to illustrate their interaction with stoichiometry. Only tree biomass C significantly increased with stand development. Leaf N and trunk P concentrations generally increased, but branch P decreased with growth stage. Fine roots had the highest C and P concentrations at the middle-aged stage. In contrast, shrubs, herbs, litter, and soil C:N:P stoichiometry did not change significantly during stand development. Leaf N and P were positively correlated with soil C, N, P, and their ratios. However, there was no significant correlation between litter and leaves in terms of C:N:P stoichiometry. A redundancy analysis showed that soil N best explained leaf N and P variance, and tree biomass and C stock were related to biotic factors such as tree age and shrub biomass. Hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that, compared with soil or litter variables, stand age only accounted for a relatively small proportion of leaf C, N, and P variation. Thus, secondary Quercus ecosystems might have inherent ability to maintain sensitive responses of metabolically active organs to environmental factors during stand aging. The results of this work help to elucidate the biogeochemical cycling of secondary forest ecosystems in tree development, provide novel insights into the adaptation strategies of plants in different organs and growth stages, and could be used to guide fertilization programs and optimize forest structure.

Although the factors controlling the spatiotemporal distribution of F- contents have been analyzed, their contributions have rarely been quantified. In this study, 510 water samples were collected in the dry and wet seasons in China's Loess Plateau to investigate the spatial and seasonal distribution, controlling factors, and potential health risks of F- in natural water. High -F- waters were mainly distributed in valley areas of the Loess Plateau, and more severe fluoride pollution of streamwater and groundwater was found in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Mineral dissolution, competitive adsorption, adsorption/desorption and cation exchange jointly controlled F- enrichment. Spatiotemporal distribution of high -F- levels was mainly determined by climate and streamwater-groundwater connectivity in the dry season, with contribution rates of 41.7% and 37.6%, and by terrain and anthropogenic activities in the wet season, with contribution rates and 49.9-55.6% and 30.7%, respectively. Fluoride in groundwater through oral intake posed the greatest health risks to infants, followed by children, teenagers and adults in the dry and wet seasons. This study provides a scientific basis for the effective management of high -F- water in arid regions.

Traditional GRN research focuses on the analysis of the regulatory relationships through the average of cellular gene expressions. These methods are difficult to identify the cell heterogeneity of gene expression. Existing methods for inferring GRN using single-cell transcriptional data lack expression information when genes reach steady state, and the high dimensionality of single-cell data leads to high temporal and spatial complexity of the algorithm. In order to solve the problem in traditional GRN inference methods, including the lack of cellular heterogeneity information, single-cell data complexity and lack of steady-state information, we propose a method for GRN inference using single-cell transcription and gene knockout data, called SINgle-cell transcription data-KNOckout data (SIN-KNO), which focuses on combining dynamic and steady-state information of regulatory relationship contained in gene expression. Capturing cell heterogeneity information could help understand the gene expression difference in different cells. So, we could observe gene expression changes more accurately. Gene knockout data could observe the gene expression levels at steady-state of all other genes when one gene is knockout. Classifying the genes before analyzing the single-cell data could determine a large number of non-existent regulation, greatly reducing the number of regulation required for inference. In order to show the efficiency, the proposed method has been compared with several typical methods in this area including GENIE3, JUMP3, and SINCE-RITIES. The results of the evaluation indicate that the proposed method can analyze the diversified information contained in the two types of data, establish a more accurate gene regulation network, and improve the computational efficiency. The method provides a new thinking for dealing with large datasets and high computational complexity of single-cell data in the GRN inference.

However, it remains unclear how the vegetation stem coverage affects the hydraulic parameters and the on-wall and jet flow characteristics at the gully head. A simulation flow scouring experiment was performed to explore the influences of the vegetation stem coverage (5 levels) on the hydraulic parameters and on-wall and jet flow proportions at the gully head under inflow discharges ranging from 3.6-9.6 m3 h-1. The results indicated that the runoff in the upstream area occurred in the supercritical turbulent flow regime, and its velocity decreased while the Manning roughness coefficient and Darcy-Weisbach coefficient increased with increasing vegetation stem diameter. The runoff velocity at the gully brink decreased with increasing vegetation stem diameter and increased as a linear function of the inflow discharge (R2 = 0.849-0.997). With increasing vegetation stem diameter, the proportion of on-wall flow increased, and the proportion of jet flow decreased. The on-wall and jet flow proportions ranged from 7% to 92% and 8% to 93%, respectively, under inflow discharges from 3.6-9.6 m3 h 1, thereby attaining the highest correlation with the runoff velocity, Reynolds number, and runoff kinetic energy and following a significant logarithmic function. The vegetation stem influences the hy-draulic parameters of the upstream area and gully head and thus influences the on-wall/jet flow proportion. This study could help elucidate the effect of vegetation on the hydraulic mechanism of headcut erosion and provide a theoretical foundation for improving gully headcut erosion models.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				AUG	2023	229								107201	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107201		MAY 2023											WOS:001007156700001

In recent years, reports from Israel and other countries suggest that cracking incidence has increased, which might indicate that climate change intensifies the phenomena. The study aims to develop a machine learning (ML) model for predicting the effect of climate measures (i.e., temperature, radiation, and humidity with daily resolution) along with management and environmental characteristics in two citrus mandarins, 'Nova' and 'Ori', one is prone to cracking and the other is less sensitive. ML model was developed based on data from approximately 250 citrus orchards across Israel collected over three seasons from 2019 to 2021. Our approach uses TSFRESH to extract and select features and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain the factor's intensity using trained classification and regression models based on the H2O-AutoML package. Gathered data skewed toward a low cracking percentage better predicted low and medium cracking levels, with a classification accuracy of 76% and regression mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.78%. Our study reaffirms the genetic background's primary role in cracking. Notably, our analysis unveils fresh insights into cracking causes needing further exploration. The 40% quantile temperature (23.5 degrees C) is a novel finding as a learned threshold. 'Nova' may elevate cracking by 10%, 'Ori' could reduce it by 4%. Additionally, tree age exhibits a linear correlation when trees over 20 years correlate with up to 4% less cracking. These insights are crucial for comprehending, addressing, and managing the phenomenon at a significant spatial scale. The model, with further data support, may provide farmers with an effective tool for treating the severity of cracking incidence by developing a spatial-temporal decision-support system as a protocol to reduce the phenomenon on a regional scale and selecting regions that are relevant for citrus plantations.

J	Cheng, LP; Si, BC; Wang, YP; Liu, WZ				Cheng, Liping; Si, Bingcheng; Wang, Yaping; Liu, Wenzhao			Groundwater recharge mechanisms on the Loess Plateau of China: New evidence for the significance of village ponds	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Numerous studies have been conducted to understand the mechanism of groundwater recharge for water resources management. But the roles of wide-spread village ponds on the Chinese Loess Plateau on groundwater recharge remains uncertain. Here, to evaluate the groundwater recharge under village ponds, we measured environmental tracers (H-2, O-18, Cl-) in rainwater, groundwater, and pore waters of the deep unsaturated zone under three land-cover types (cropland, a village pond, and two apple orchards with stand ages of 10 and 27 years). The results show that shallow groundwater is recharged by both diffusive recharge and focused recharge. Specifically, diffusive recharge occurs beneath farmlands, grasslands, orchards and similar land-cover types, but diminishes in old orchards due to deep root water uptake. The diffusive recharge beneath crop field had an infiltration velocity of 10.3-12.5 cm yr(-1); the resulting recharge rate was 30-33 mm yr(-1), accounting for 5-6% of the annual precipitation. However, focused recharge occurs mainly beneath village ponds with low-lying terrain, and had an infiltration velocity of 26 cm d(-1) during the rainy season; the resulting mean recharge rate was 134 mm yr(-1) in the catchment of the pond, accounting for 23.1% of the annual precipitation. Given that the water table is generally more than 30 m below the soil surface, it takes hundreds of years for rainwater to reach the water table via the diffusive recharge but only days to months via the focused recharge. Diffusive recharge contributed 55-68% to the total recharge while focused recharge contributed 32-45%. However, the conversion of croplands to apple orchards and the decrease in the number of village ponds are occurring, which diminishes diffusive recharge, and reduces focused recharge, respectively. These findings are critical to understanding hydrological processes and protecting groundwater resources. We should preserve, reclaim, and construct village ponds to ensure groundwater recharge, in addition to optimizing areal ratio of large farmland to apple orchards in the region for the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources.					cheng, Liping/GYU-6861-2022; Si, Bing Cheng/H-8745-2012	Si, Bing Cheng/0000-0002-7497-5033; Cheng, Liping/0000-0001-5016-0887													0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 1	2021	257								107148	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107148		SEP 2021											WOS:000703508100008

Implication of blanket NPK application on nutrient balance of maize based on soil and tissue diagnosis approaches in the savannas of northern Nigeria	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Improper nutrient management reduces the yield and affects the nutrient status of crops. This study aimed to diagnose the nutrients limitation in maize. A three-year multi-location (348 sites) nutrient experiments were conducted in randomized block design to analyse nutrients limitation for maize production under conventional fertilizer recommendation system in Nigeria using DRIS, and to identify soil factors that influence DRIS indices using random forest model. DRIS indices for nutrients were calculated from the results of ear leaf samples collected from the experimental plots. The DRIS indices were summed, and used to cluster plots using k-means cluster algorithm. The results show large differences in average yield between the clusters. The clusters also differed based on frequency with which nutrients are most limiting. B was the most limiting in cluster one and three, Mn in cluster two and K in cluster four. Random forest results show that soil pH, B and Mg had the largest influence on DRIS indices in cluster one. DRIS indices were most influenced by soil N and B in cluster two. To a lesser extent, the soil Fe, K, Mg and S contents also influenced DRIS indices in cluster two. Soil K, B and Zn were the most significant factors influencing the DRIS indices in cluster four. Bulk Density, Fe, Na, ECEC, and organic carbon had a moderate influence on the indices in this cluster. Nutrient limitation in plants can be diagnose using the DRIS. Soil properties have a definite influence on maize nutrient status.

As an important component of soil particles, soil inorganic carbon (SIC) contains little information on its redistribution during splash erosion. In this study, two soils, purple soil and loess, were selected and placed in a soil tray with a diameter of 20 cm at the center of a splash tray, and a rainfall simulator was used to simulate three raindrop energies in experiments to investigate the migration of soil particles and SIC. The results showed differences in the amount and selective migration of splashed material between the soils, which was evident in the obvious sorting of the particle size of purple soil with distance and the insignificant change of loess soil. The SIC sorting characteristic performed differently in the two soils, that is, the SIC content of purple soil increased with particle size, while that of loess was the opposite. The enrichment and depletion of SIC during splash erosion varied with soil type, and differed from the general enrichment of soil organic carbon (SOC). The SIC enrichment ratio (ERIC) of purple soil was generally > 1, whereas the ERIC values of loess were < 1. In addition, multiple linear regression (MLR) models were established to predict the SIC content of splashed material. Rainfall splash plays an important role in SIC migration and may further affect the carbon cycle. These preliminary results provide a basis for further study of SIC response to rainfall splash.

This study proposes an approach for generating MZs using time-series clustering (TSC) to also enable time-specific management. TSC was applied to daily remote sensing retrievals in a California vineyard during four growing seasons (2015-2018) using three datasets: evapotranspiration (ET), leaf area index (LAI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Distinct MZs were delineated based on similarities in pixel-level temporal dynamics for each dataset, using dissimilarity index to determine the optimal number of clusters and compare TSC results. The differences between the cluster centers were calculated, along with the ratio between the centers' differences and the range of each dataset, denoting the degree of difference between MZs centers. Similarity between MZs from each factor was quantified using Cramer's V and Frechet distances. Finally, an aggregated (multi-factor) MZ map was generated using multivariate clustering. The resulting MZs were compared to a 2016 yield map to determine the significance of differences between means and distribution among MZs. The findings show that LAI TSC achieved the best cluster separation. The NDVI and LAI MZs maps were nearly identical (Cramer's V of 0.97), while ET showed weaker similarities to NDVI and LAI (0.61 and 0.62, respectively). Similar findings were observed for the Frechet distances. The yield values were found to be significantly different among MZs for all TSC maps. TSC may be further utilized for defining within-field spatial variability and temporal dynamics for precision irrigation practices that account for spatial and temporal variability.

However, how this interaction affects vegetation succession and how soil nutrient recovery is driven by vegetation restoration and rhizosphere processes are still largely unknown. In this study, a well-documented grassland restoration chronosequence on the Loess Plateau, China (fields at 0, 7, 12, 17, 22, and 32 years after farmland abandonment and a natural grassland reference) was selected. The species richness and diversity reached maximum values between 17 and 22 years after farmland abandonment, whereas the plant total above and belowground biomasses simultaneously peaked at 22 years and then remained stable. In the dominant plant rhizosphere and bulk soil concentrations of total glomalin-related soil protein (including both old and recently produced fungal proteins) substantially increased from 3.58 to 4.87 g kg(-1) and from 2.67 to 3.86 g kg(-1), respectively, between 12 and 32 years after farmland abandonment. The concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in the plant rhizosphere and bulk soil significantly increased between 17 and 32 years and reached the levels of the natural grassland. The aboveground plant biomass, soil SOC, and TN concentrations were positively correlated with the glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) concentration (p < .05). Our study suggested that interactions among plant-mycorrhizae association, plant diversity, and biomass promote GRSP and nutrient accumulation in the plant rhizosphere and bulk soil, and GRSP largely contributes to SOC stabilization and the accumulation of SOC and TN.

Sigrun			Supplementing grass-based cattle feeds with legume leaves and its effects on manure quality and value as a soil improver for an Anthropic Ferralsol in Rwanda	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Combined use of lime, animal manure and inorganic fertilisers is effective in replenishing the fertility of degraded acid soils. However, many smallholder farmers lack access to sufficient amounts of these inputs to improve the fertility and reduce the aluminium toxicity of Ferralsols. Organic manures are available but often have low nutrient content, which limits their ability to supply nutrients to soils. In a two-factor field experiment over four seasons on an Anthropic Ferralsol in Southern Province, Rwanda, we assessed (i) the effect of cattle manure on soil properties at a reduced rate affordable to smallholder farmers compared with that of NPK fertiliser applied, with and without lime also at a reduced rate, and (ii) the effect of supplementing grass in a basal cattle diet with legume leaves on manure quality and its effect on soil properties. Manure from cattle fed only the grassChloris gayana(grass-only manure) and from cattle fedC. gayanasupplemented withAcacia angustissimaleaves (grass+legume manure) was applied at 5 t dry matter ha(-1)(25% of the recommended rate) at the beginning of each growing season. NPK was applied as split doses supplying a total rate of 70 kg N ha(-1). Lime was applied annually at a rate of 2.0 t CaO ha(-1), which was 25% of the rate required to neutralise total acidity at the site. All amendments were applied only to the soil surrounding the maize plants (planting stations), which is estimated at 25% of the plot area. Maize stover was left on plots after harvest and planting stations were retained over all growing seasons. All treatments altered soil properties at the planting stations. Lime generally increased pH but there was no significant difference between lime plus manure treatments and non-limed manure treatments. Soil organic carbon concentration and cation exchange capacity were higher in manure and NPK treatments than in non-fertilised treatments. The manure treatment increased soil water-holding capacity compared with the NPK and non-fertilised treatments. There was no significant difference in total N, Ca2+, Mg(2+)and K(+)between the NPK and manure treatments. Micro-dosing animal manure can thus replace mineral fertiliser plus lime for soil fertility replenishment in smallholder farming. Grass+legume manure contained higher concentrations of total N, Ca, Mg, K and Na than grass-only manure, but its effect on soil properties did not differ significantly from that of grass-only manure.

Design, Development and Evaluation of Lever type Maize Sheller	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH												An investigation was carried out to design, develop and evaluate the performance of manually operated Lever type Maize Sheller (LMS). It consisted of a handle, guiding rod, supporting rod, spring loaded ram, maize cob guiding cylinder, shelling blade, buffer, collection chamber, shutter and frame. Performance of developed LMS was statistically compared with Tubular Maize Sheller (TMS) in terms of throughput capacity, shelling capacity, shelling efficiency, unshelled seeds and damaged seeds percentage at different maize cob length. The overall throughput capacity and shelling capacity was found to be 44.63 kg cobs/h and 33.90 kg seeds/h with LMS which was almost 3 times more as compare to TMS. The overall shelling efficiency of 96.34% and 99.45% was observed with LMS and TMS respectively. The unshelled seeds of 3.66% with LMS and 0.55% with TMS were observed. The seed damage during operation with LMS was around 5%, while it was nil in case of TMS. The total savings on shelling hundred kg seeds with LMS was found as. 202 and. 424 on comparing with TMS and bare hand method of shelling respectively. The performance evaluation and economic analysis reveals that the adoption of developed Lever type Maize Sheller can be economical and technically feasible.

We assessed the stand structure and estimated the total stem volume of a 30-year-old Eucalyptus globulus forest in the highlands ( >3000 m altitude) of northern Ethiopia. Census data were collected from 186 trees, of which 28 trees were destructively sampled. The forest stand density was 581 trees ha(-1), mean +/- SD diameter at breast height was 21.2 +/- 6.4 cm, and mean +/- SD predicted tree height was 22.0 +/- 4.2 m. The estimated stem volume was 269.7 m(3) ha(-1). An allometric model to predict tree height was derived using the measured diameter at breast height of the sampled trees. Moreover, an allometric model was developed to estimate stem volume for standing trees in order to describe the relationship between the stem volume and diameter at breast height squared X tree height (incorporated as a compound variable), using data on 38 trees for which height could be measured reliably. The findings suggest that the diameter at breast height alone can be used to estimate stem volume, and thus may be useful for simple forest monitoring in the study region. This study is one of the few to assess the stand structure and stem volume of a high-altitude Eucalyptus plantation.																			0021-3551						2020	54	2					185	191																WOS:000528781600010
J	Mao, XG; Liu, XM; Zhou, X				Mao, Xuegang; Liu, Xiuming; Zhou, Xia			Permo-Triassic aeolian red clay of southwestern England and its palaeoenvironmental implications	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Late Permian and Triassic red mudstones are widely distributed and exposed in southwestern England. This homogenous, massive mudstone succession has been extensively studied for its palaeoenvironmental potential. However, its origin and palaeoenvironment remain under debate. The Triassic Mercia mudstone was early proposed to be aeolian loessic clay based on collapse nature when wetted or loaded and its similarities with aeolian clay in Quaternary Australia, but lacks experimental confirmation and is not generally accepted. In comparison with aeolian red clay in China, here we confirmed that the Triassic Mercia mudstone, together with the Upper Permian Aylesbeare mudstone, was dominated by aeolian clay. This was based on lines of evidence regarding sedimentary structure, particle grain size, geochemistry, micromorphology, and pedogenic features. The results showed that the Mercia mudstone and the Aylesbeare mudstone had sedimentary structures and grain size distributions that were similar to the aeolian red clay in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The major chemical elements correlated well with the aeolian red clay, with the exception of minor discrepancies in CaO and K2O. The similarity in the rare earth element (REE) distribution of the Mercia mudstone and the Aylesbeare mustone with aeolian red clay inferred their similar origin. Widespread pedogenic features indicated the universal development of palaeovertisols forming in alternating wet/dry climates. It was hypothesised that Permo-Triassic southwestern England was dominated by aeolian dust accumulation in a seasonal wet/dry climate, whereas perennial lakes or longstanding rivers across the study area might not exist.

One possible remedy is the application of biochar-containing compost. In this study, cucumber quality and the abundance of ARGs in soil-cucumber systems under different compost treatments, namely, traditional pig manure and corn straw compost (PC); pig manure, corn straw, and large particle size biochar (5-10 mm) compost (PCLB); and pig manure, corn straw, and small particle size biochar (<2 mm) compost (PCSB); were investigated. The results showed that, under PCSB, the yield, vitamin C and soluble protein content of the cucumbers were the highest, while the absolute abundance of intI2 was reduced in the soil. The amount of available potassium in the soil contributed the most to changes in cucumber yield and quality. The total absolute abundance of ARGs in the soil was highest in PC, followed by PCLB, PCSB, and CK (control treatment without fertilization) treatments. Compared to CK treatments, PCLB and PCSB applications to the soil decreased the abundance of sul1 and tetG by 42-57% and 38-80%, respectively, in the cucumbers. In summary, the PCSB application was more beneficial in increasing soil nutrient content; improving cucumber yield, vitamin C, and soluble protein content; and reducing the risk of input and transport of ARGs in the soil-cucumber system.																				2071-1050				JUN	2023	15	12							9563	10.3390/su15129563	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15129563													WOS:001017766700001
J	Lu, SN; Yao, C; Wu, FQ				Lu, Shuning; Yao, Chong; Wu, Faqi			Effects of Counter Tillage and Slope Gradient on Nutrient Losses on Sloping Farmland	SUSTAINABILITY												Counter tillage is a typical cultivation practice on the Loess Plateau, which can influence the soil erosion process by intercepting runoff and increasing infiltration. However, few studies have investigated the mechanisms of nutrient losses associated with counter tillage. This study was conducted to reveal the effects of counter tillage and slope gradient on the soil nutrient loss mechanism on sloping farmland. In this study, the rainfall simulation was conducted with a rainfall intensity of 90 mm.h(-1) and with five slope gradients (5.24%, 8.75%, 17.63%, 26.79%, 36.40%). The runoff plots involved the counter tillage (CT) and traditional plow (CK), in order to investigate the characteristics of soil erosion and available phosphorus (AP), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) losses. The soil erosion characteristics included the time until runoff generation, RR (runoff rate), and SR (sediment rate); the nutrient loss characteristics included nutrient loss concentrations, nutrient loss and nutrient loss rate in runoff or sediment. The results indicated that the RR and SR with a slope gradient of 5.24 similar to 26.79% on CT decreased by 11.77 similar to 94.92% and 20.69 similar to 99.27%, respectively, compared with that of CK. As the slope gradient increased (36.40%), a break in the ridge occurred and the reduction in the RR and SR was weakened; this was likely to be close to that of the CK. Nutrient losses differed significantly between different slope gradients and tillage practices. Nutrient losses increased with an increasing slope gradient. The nutrient losses of AP, NH4+-N, and NO3--N in runoff, with the slope gradient of 36.40%, increased 75.75%, 76.34%, 75.63%; meanwhile, in sediment, it increased 32.93, 30.70, 32.18 times, compared with the slope gradient of 5.24% on CT. The CT with the slope gradient of 5.24 similar to 26.79% had a good effect in controlling nutrient losses; however, for the slope gradient of 36.40%, the effects of CT in controlling nutrient losses decreased. The nutrient loss rate and RR or SR satisfied a linear positive correlation. The reduction benefits of nutrient losses on CT in runoff and sediment can reach 57.7% to 100% and 45.5% to 100%, respectively. In conclusion, CT is an effective tillage practice to control soil erosion and nutrient losses. This study can provide a reference for soil erosion and nutrient loss control on sloping farmland on the Loess Plateau.																				2071-1050				FEB	2023	15	3							2019	10.3390/su15032019	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15032019													WOS:000930746200001

A rich body of theoretical work provides distinct predictions regarding the distribution of dispersal abilities in relation to fragmentation gradient. Yet, empirical data remains elusive in general, and it is lacking for anthropogeni-cinduced landscapes in particular. We collected 9884 seeds of a wind-dispersed annual species Geropogon hybridus (Asteraceae) from 807 individual plants of 55 populations spanning three landscapes in a fragmented agroecosystem and measured four major dispersal-related traits at the landscape, population, plant and seed levels. Contrary to previous studies that were based on island or urban landscapes and where fragmentation was associated with reduced dispersal, we revealed increased seed dispersal ability in the more fragmented patches. However, the specific relationships between dispersal-related traits and fragmentation characteristics varied with ecological scale. The discrepancy between our results and those from previous studies may be explained by the milder contrast between the fragmented patches and the surrounding matrix in our system, which is a common feature in many agroecosystems. The findings add to the accumulating evidence that different selection pressures and constraints act on seed dispersal evolution under the global land use change.

However, factors determining variations in fungal diversity and their biogeographic patterns in this rigorously affected landscape area remain poorly understood. Therefore, we performed Illumina MiSeq high throughput sequencing of the fungal specific, internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region from 24 representative soils covering forest, grassland and agricultural lands from 8 distinct landscapes. Using this technique, we demonstrate that fungal members belonging to phylum Ascomycota dominated in all soils investigated in this study with an average relative abundance higher than 80%. High fungal richness in the Loess Plateau soils is ascribed to the retrieval of 1,822,499 quality sequences belonging to 13,533 different phylotypes. However, this richness/phylotype number decreased (from 779 to 561) with increasing longitudinal gradient through 107 degrees 39' to 109 degrees 36'. Interestingly, higher fungal diversity (in terms of presence of diverse fungal taxa) occurred as microbial biomass carbon (MBC) concentration decreased (approximately from 500 to 100 mg kg(-1)) in soils. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that geographic distance contributed more to fungal community variation (38.3%) than soil properties (22.2%) at the landscape level (similar to 400 km). As indicated by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), among soil properties, concentrations of MBC primarily affected (significantly corrected with NMDS 1; r = 0.620; p < 0.01) fungal community structure in the current study. This study therefore constitutes an essential set of information and recommends usage of information on fungal community structure as a potential ecological indicator of the Loess Plateau region.

Straw returning can increase soil fertility with a consequent reduction in fertilizer, but the effects of fertilizer reduction coupled with straw returning on crop endophytic microbes and crop disease are poorly understood. Therefore, using metagenomic sequencing methods we investigated the responses of soil fertility, diversity, the function of root endophytic bacteria, and the occurrence of wheat crown rot due to the application of fertilizer (no, moderate and excessive fertilizer) coupled with or without straw returning after 7 years of treatments. The results showed that, after excessive fertilization, the wheat crown rot became severe, registering a disease index of 23. Compared with excessive fertilization, moderate fertilization coupled with straw returning significantly reduced the incidence of wheat crown rot, the disease index was reduced by 38.50%, and the richness and diversity of endophytic bacteria were increased by 61.20 and 11.93%, respectively, but the soil fertility was not significantly affected. In addition, moderate fertilization coupled with straw returning changed the community structure of endophytic bacteria and increased the relative abundance of carbohydrate metabolism and nitrogen fixation-related genes by 4.72 and 9.32%, respectively. Our results indicated that fertilizer reduction coupled with straw returning reduced the occurrence of wheat crown rot, increased the diversity of endophytic bacteria, and changed the community structure and function of endophytic bacteria, which will provide a better understanding of the interaction of fertilization coupled with straw returning, endophytic bacteria and wheat crown rot.

In this study, Old World bluestems (native C-4 grass) and switchgrass were sowed at five mixture ratios (8:0, 6:2, 4:4, 2:6 and 0:8) under two soil water levels (80% field capacity (FC) and 40% FC) and two nitrogen (N) treatments (0 and 100 mg N/kg dry soil, termed N-0-unfertilized and N-1-fertilized treatments, respectively) in a pot experiment in 2012. Biomass, root morphological traits and relative competitive abilities of these two species were analyzed. Results showed that biomass of both species was significantly greater under 80% FC or N fertilization, and switchgrass had a relatively larger root:shoot ratio (RSR). Total root length (TRL) and root surface area (RSA) of switchgrass were significantly higher under 80% FC irrespective of N treatment, while those of Old World bluestems were only significantly higher under N fertilization. N had no significant effect on TRL and RSA of switchgrass, while RSA of Old World bluestems significantly increased under 80% FC and N fertilization. Under 40% FC and N-0-unfertilized treatment, the aggressivity of Old World bluestems was larger than zero at 2:6 and 4:4 mixture ratios of two species, whereas it was close to zero at 6:2 mixture ratio. Root competitive ability of switchgrass significantly increased under 80% FC or N fertilization. The aggressivity of Old World bluestems was negative at 6:2 mixture ratio under 80% FC and N fertilization, while it was positive at 2:6 mixture ratio. Switchgrass may become more aggressive when N deposition or rainfall increases, while a proper mixture ratio with appropriate water and N management could help with grassland management in the semi-arid Loess Plateau.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				JUL	2021	13	7					730	743		10.1007/s40333-021-0010-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-021-0010-8													WOS:000685300400006

However, the main drivers for soil delta N-15 in different natural land use types are not clear enough. To investigate the main drivers for soil delta N-15 in different land uses, we measured delta N-15 in the top 10 cm of the soil along a precipitation gradient with various land uses on the Loess Plateau of China, which covers a total area of 620,000 km(2) and is one of the most erodible area in the world, to determine effects of climatic, soil and vegetation factors on soil delta N-15 and the relationships between them using the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method. Soil delta N-15 ranged from 1 parts per thousand to 9 parts per thousand on the Loess Plateau with an average of 5.8 parts per thousand in forest lands, 5.6 parts per thousand in shrub lands, and 4.8 parts per thousand in grasslands. Calculated variable influence on projection by PLSR showed that both soil properties (including soil organic carbon content, total nitrogen content and soil texture) and mean annual precipitation influenced soil delta N-15 strongly. In addition, site elevation also influenced soil delta N-15 strongly in forest lands. The dominant controls of soil delta N-15 varied among three land use types on the Chinese Loess Plateau, and PLSR would be a reasonable tool to predict soil delta N-15.

M.; Li, Feng-Min; Yuan, Zi-Qiang			The prolonged effect of film mulch and P application on lucerne forage yield in a semiarid environment	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												IntroductionLimited water and soil phosphorus (P) availability often hampers lucerne productivity in semiarid regions. Plastic film mulch and P application typically enhance young lucerne (2-3 years) productivity by increasing soil water use and P availability. However, the prolonged impact of film mulch and P application on lucerne productivity as the stand ages remains unclear.MethodsThis study conducted a 9-year field experiment on the semiarid Loess Plateau to investigate how film mulch and P application affect lucerne forage yield, soil water content, and soil fertility. The field experiment used a split-plot design with randomized blocks, in which the whole plots were with (M1) and without plastic film mulch (M0), and the split plots were four P rates (0 (P0), 9.7 (P1), 19.2 (P2), and 28.8 (P3) kg P ha-1).Results and discussionThe M1 treatment produced significantly higher lucerne forage yields than the M0 treatment during the first five years, but the yield-increasing effect of film mulch gradually diminished over time, with no effect in Years 6-8, and lower yields than the M0 treatment in Year 9. Phosphorus fertilization significantly increased forage yield after Year 3 in the M0 treatment, but only in Years 3-5 in the M1 treatment. In Years 2-5, film mulch significantly increased soil organic carbon, total nitrogen (N), inorganic N, and microbial biomass carbon in P0, P1, and P2 but not in P3. However, in Years 7-9, film mulch significantly decreased soil available potassium (K), organic carbon mineralization, lucerne density, and shoot K concentration, but did not reduce soil N and P availability at any level P of application. Moreover, plastic film mulch significantly increased the soil water content at 0-300 cm deep from Year 7 onwards. In conclusion, film mulch ceased to enhance lucerne production beyond year 6, which could not be attributed to soil water content, N or P availability but was partially associated with reduced soil K availability. Consequently, future research should focus on soil K availability, and K addition should be considered after five years in lucerne pastures mulched with plastic film in semiarid areas.																			1664-462X					DEC 11	2023	14								1331704	10.3389/fpls.2023.1331704	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1331704								38146272					WOS:001129254200001

Dark host specificity in two ectoparasite taxa: repeatability, parasite traits, and environmental effects	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												We applied the concept of dark diversity (species that may potentially inhabit a locality but are absent) to the host spectrum of a parasite and defined it as dark host specificity (DHS). We studied the trait-associated and geographic patterns of dark host specificity in fleas and gamasid mites parasitic on small mammals, asking the following questions: (a) Is dark host specificity repeatable across populations of the same species? (b) Is it associated with morphological and/or ecological species traits? (c) What are the factors associated with geographical variation in the DHS among populations of the same species? The DHS was repeatable within species with a large proportion of variance among samples, accounted for by differences between species. The average DHS of fleas, but not mites, was affected by parasite traits, with the DHS being higher in fleas with larger geographic ranges, higher characteristic abundance levels, and summer reproduction peaks. In the majority of ectoparasites, the regional DHS decreased with an increase in either structural or phylogenetic host specificity. The associations between the DHS and the environmental or host-associated characteristics of a region were revealed in a few species (eight of 22 fleas and three of 12 mites). The DHS decreased with (a) an increase in air temperature in two fleas, (b) a decrease in precipitation in two fleas, and (c) an increase in regional host species richness (in three fleas and three mites). Overall, our results suggest that dark host specificity in arthropod ectoparasites is a species-specific character associated, to a large extent, with the breadth of their host-related niches, while the influences of parasite traits and local environmental conditions are minor.

As a low-cost and environmentally friendly technology, activated water has the potential to increase crop yields and improve water and fertilizer use efficiency, but much research is still needed to make this technology widely available in the field. Hydroponic experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of magnetized water, aerated water, and magnetized aerated water on rice and wheat seedling and root growth. The results showed that aerated water irrigation significantly increased plant height by 5.1-9.6%, leaf area by 21.1%, and aboveground biomass by 14.8-16.3%, respectively. Aerated water irrigation also significantly promoted rice root biomass, maximum root length, total root length, total root surface area, and especially the proportion of roots less than 0.5 mm in diameter, indicating that aerated water enhances the growth of rice seedlings mainly by promoting root growth, especially fine root (D <= 0.5 mm) growth. The maximum root length and total root volume of wheat roots under magnetized water irrigation treatment were increased by 7.7-8.6% and 17.2%, respectively, resulting in a significant increase in aboveground dry biomass by 13.6%. Magnetized water and magnetized aerated water irrigation also promoted the growth of rice seedlings and roots. In contrast, aerated water and magnetized aerated water irrigation exhibited an inhibitory effect on the growth of wheat seedlings and roots. Therefore, activated water has different effects on different crops in hydroponics, and more research is needed in the future to determine the conditions for the application of activated water in agriculture.																				2073-4395				MAY	2022	12	5							1068	10.3390/agronomy12051068	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12051068													WOS:000802384300001

Temporal variation of metacommunity structure in arthropod ectoparasites harboured by small mammals: the effects of scale and climatic fluctuations	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												We applied the elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) approach and studied the temporal dynamics of metacommunity structure in arthropod ectoparasites (fleas, gamasid mites and ixodid ticks) harboured by six small mammalian hosts sampled for three decades in the same locality in Western Siberia at three hierarchical scales (inframetacommunities, component metacommunities and a compound metacommunity). All metacommunities were positively coherent. Inframetacommunity structures varied across sampling periods in all host species. The main structural pattern in an inframetacommunity of the same host varied across sampling times but was mostly characterized by clumped species distributions (Clementsian, Gleasonian and their quasi-versions). Component metacommunities in five of the six host species were characterized by either a Clementsian or a quasi-Clementsian distribution. In four of the six host species, this pattern was driven by mite distribution. The temporal structure of compound metacommunity was characterized by a Clementsian pattern. In contrast to the majority of component metacommunities, this pattern was driven by fleas, whereas the temporal structure of gamasid mite compound metacommunities demonstrated a Gleasonian distribution. The temporal gradient in infracommunity composition was not associated with temporal changes in either air temperature or precipitation, whereas the precipitation gradient was positively correlated with the structure of component (in five host species) and compound metacommunities. In conclusion, the best-fit metacommunity structure of ectoparasites varies temporally due to temporal changes in distribution patterns that can be associated with year-to-year climatic variation, affecting both hosts and parasites.

Recent studies have shown that it is the soil internal forces that induce aggregate breakdown and subsequent splash erosion. However, little is known about the size characteristics of soil aggregate breakdown and corresponding effects on splash erosion. In this study, Cinnamon soil and Heilu soil were adopted to investigate the effects of soil internal forces on the characteristics of aggregate fragments and splash erosion through wet sieving and rainfall simulation. The results showed the following. (1) With a decrease in electrolyte concentration in soil solution, soil net repulsive force increased; meanwhile, aggregate stability decreased and splash erosion rate increased. Additionally, when the electrolyte concentration was less than 10(-2) mol L-1, soil net repulsive force hardly changed, and aggregate stability and splash erosion rate accordingly varied very little. (2) With the increase in the soil net repulsive force, the content of fragments <0.053 mm released from aggregates increased, whereas the content of fragments >0.25 mm decreased, thus suggesting that the aggregates tended to break into fine fractions as soil net repulsive forces increased. (3) Regression analyses showed that soil splash erosion rate decreased linearly with increases in the aggregate stability; moreover, correlation analyses showed that splash erosion rate was significantly and positively correlated with the fragments with a diameter of <0.053 mm, and negatively correlated with the fragments with a diameter of >0.25 mm. This study suggests that soil internal forces induce the aggregate crush and determine the size distribution of fragments available for mobilization by the raindrop impact force. Also, the raindrop impact force is the driving mechanism leading to the movement of fragments. This study provides new insights into the mechanism responsible for splash erosion and could be valuable for controlling soil erosion. Highlights Soil aggregates breakdown dynamics and splash erosion were quantitatively investigated. Soil internal forces determined the size distribution of fragments after aggregates breakdown. The movement of soil fragments largely depended on raindrop impact force. Splash erosion was driven by the soil internal forces and raindrop impact force.

Background and Objectives: The secondary succession of Loess Plateau forests is of great significance in global climate change, but their carbon storage dynamics are poorly understood. The study objectives were to clarify the pattern of changes and contribution level of carbon stocks in various components of ecosystem during succession. Materials and Methods: We selected 18 plots for Pinus tabuliformis Carr. forest at the early stage of succession, 19 for pine-broadleaved mixed forest at the middle stage, and 12 for Quercus-broadleaved mixed forest at the climax stage to determine the tree, shrub, herb, fine root, litter, coarse wood debris (CWD), and soil carbon stocks. Results: Ecosystem carbon stocks increased from 160.73 to 231.14 Mgha(-1) with the succession stages. Vegetation (including tree, shrub and herb) and soil were the two largest carbon pools, and carbon was mainly sequestrated in tree biomass and shallow soil (0-50 cm). In the early stage, soil contributed more carbon stocks to the ecosystem than vegetation, but with succession, the soil contribution decreased while vegetation contribution increased, finally reaching a balance (46.78% each) at the climax stage. Fine root, litter, and CWD contributed little (average 6.59%) to ecosystem carbon stocks and were mainly involved in the turnover of vegetation biomass to soil carbon. Conclusions: Our results provide direct evidence for carbon sequestration of secondary forests on the Loess Plateau. The dynamic results of carbon storage provide an important basis for forest restoration management under climate change.

No-tillage, straw mulching, or planting green manure can improve soil water storage or soil quality. However, further research is needed to optimize these soil and fertilizer management strategies to maximize yield and effectively utilize resources.Objective: The present study aimed to determine the optimal soil and fertilizer management strategies to maximize wheat growth and water/nitrogen utilization efficiency, while minimizing nitrogen fertilizer input.Methods: Five different soil and fertilizer treatments were tested on the Loess Plateau between 2009 and 2021, including traditional tillage followed by bare soil (CK), no-till with straw mulching (NTSM), no-till with straw mulching followed by leguminous green manure (OPT), and reductions in N fertilizer inputs of 10% (OPT10) and 20% (OPT20) under OPT.Results: The average results from 12 years of research revealed that the soil water content (SWC) and NO3--N content in the 0-20 cm soil depth under OPT were higher by 4.3% and 13.4% compared to CK (P < 0.01), and the length and surface area of the wheat roots were higher by 20.9% and 11.0% (P < 0.01), respectively. Optimized soil and fertilizer management delayed leaf senescence and enhanced the antioxidant and photosynthetic capacities of the wheat crop. Compared with CK, the net photosynthetic rate and superoxide dismutase activity were 38.6% and 11.6% higher under OPT, respectively, and no significant differences were observed between OPT and OPT10. Optimized soil and fertilizer management promoted wheat yield formation, water and fertilizer use efficiency, and OPT obtained the highest yield (4497.3 kg ha(- 1)), N uptake (138.7 kg ha(- 1)), and water use efficiency (WUE, 13.3 kg ha(- 1)). Compared with CK, OPT increased the wheat yield, N uptake, WUE, and WP by 21.5%, 16.7%, 16.6%, and 12.6%, respectively, and there were no significant differences between OPT10 and OPT.Conclusions: Optimizing the soil and fertilizer management strategies increased the soil water and NO3--N contents, delayed leaf senescence, enhanced the leaf antioxidant and photosynthetic capacities, promoted wheat yield formation and efficient resource utilization.

Yet, it remains unclear how and which plant traits regulate the assembly process and thus affect ecosystem structure and function under climate changes. Here, we selected six steppe sites with snow fences along a precipitation gradient in inner Mongolia. We measured traits including plant height and leaf carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations. We incorporated intraspecific trait variation to quantify the strength of external filters (assembly processes outside the community at a larger spatial scale), the strength of internal filters (assembly processes within the local community), and functional redundancy (the number of species having a similar function to an ecosystem). We applied these assembly rules to explain the changes in biodiversity and productivity in response to changing precipitation. We found that increased rainfall reduced plant carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorous (P) concentrations, but did not affect plant height. High snowfall increased phosphorous concentration, but did not affect other traits. Latent variable models identified climate (rainfall) and soil nutrient conditions (soil total N and P content) were more important than external filtering processes in predicting species richness. However, external filtering processes were the most important predictor of productivity. More specifically, we found with the increase in steppe productivity, the strength of the external filtering on leaf N increased and on plant height decreased, leading to leaf N converging into a small range but broadening the range of plant height. The internal filters had no significant effects on species richness or productivity. Additionally, we found that low precipitation reduced functional redundancy. We emphasize that intraspecific trait-variation drives plant productivity and richness responses to precipitation changes by regulating community assemblage. Our finding also underlines the importance to separate the contributions of different functional traits in regulating the responses of ecosystem structure and function to climate changes.

Tzvel. Design/methodology/approach The study established seven N concentration gradients (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 g N m(-2)) to simulate the continuous increase in N deposition for the cultivation of L. chinensis seedlings and assess the response mechanism of the cloned L. chinensis plant at different N levels by analyzing the aboveground and belowground plant appearance traits, parent ramets and daughter ramets of resource allocation and biomass allocation. Findings The results of this study showed that the different N treatment levels could promote clonal growth and had certain regularity under the seven treatments. The addition of N could significantly increase the ramet number, rhizome length, rhizome spacer length, biomass of mother ramets, daughter ramets and belowground L. chinensis population when the N addition was greater than 4 g m(-2); however, the clonal growth ability of L. chinensis decreased and the rhizome length, ramet number, stem and leaf biomass of daughter ramets and stem biomass of mother ramets significantly decreased when the N addition was greater than 32 g N m(-2). Originality/value With global warming, atmospheric N deposition is increasing and it is of great significance to explore the response mechanism of different N levels for the growth of clone plants. This study provides basic data and a theoretical basis for the survival prediction of cloned plants under the background of a global climate change strategy and has important theoretical and practical significance for the scientific management of grasslands in the future.					jin, li/IWU-4648-2023														1756-8692	1756-8706				DEC 7	2020	12	5			SI		557	569		10.1108/IJCCSM-06-2020-0066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJCCSM-06-2020-0066		SEP 2020											WOS:000574449500001

In arid regions, water is the major limiting factor affecting the microbial activity and nutrient conversion. However, the effects of soil water availability on the ecological strategies and the C, N functional metabolism of desert mi-croorganisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that soil water availability and rhizosphere effect might alter the strategy for soil C, N utilization in the arid regions. To test the hypothesis, rhizosphere and bulk soil along a gradient of soil water availability in a dry area of northwestern China were analyzed. The soil samples were collected from Reaumuria songarica, Nitraria tangutorum, and Alhagi sparsifolia and were subjected to meta-genomic sequencing with a HiSeq system. The relative abundance of Gemmatimonas and Gemmatirosa increased with the increased soil water content, whereas the relative abundance of Microvirga and Nocardioides was decreased. The relative abundance of Azospirillum and Bradyrhizobium did not change with the water content as these microbial communities use limited-water, are drought-tolerant, and use inert strategies to adapt to different levels of water availability. The genes encoding ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) were more abundantly expressed in low water than in high to medium water availability (P < 0.05). The abundance of nitrate reduction genes decreased significantly with the increase in soil water availability, whereas that of denitrification genes increased. The relative abundance of the dissimilatory nitrate reduction process in the rhizosphere soil (44.83%) was significantly higher than that in the bulk soil (39.21%). It can be inferred that soil microorganisms adopt the nitrogen utilization strategy by increasing the ammonium nitrogen to mitigate reduced water availability and provide a nitrogen-rich environment to plant roots.

In recent years, the application of bio-fertilizer and stress-modulating nanoparticles (NPs) is known as one of the eco-friendly strategies for improving plants quantity and quality under stressful conditions. In order to achieve the desirable essential oil (EO) quality and quantity of thyme in water deficit conditions, a 2-year field experiment was carried out as a split plot based on the randomized complete block design (RCBD), with 12 treatments and three replications. The treatments included different irrigation levels, containing irrigation at 80% field capacity (FC80) as no stress, 60% FC as moderate water stress (FC60) and 40% FC as severe water stress (FC40), as well as four different fertilizer sources, including non-application of fertilizer (control), application of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), chitosan NPs (CHT) and co-application of AMF+CHT NPs. The results demonstrated that the dry yield of thyme decreased by 13% and 40.3% under FC60 and FC40 water stress conditions. However, co-application of AMF+CHT NPs enhanced the dry yield of thyme by 21.7% in comparison to the control (non-application of fertilizer). The maximum EO content (2.03%) and EO yield (10.04 g 7 g m(-2)) of thyme were obtained under moderate water stress (FC60) fertilized with AMF+CHT NPs. Co-application of AMF+CHT NPs enhanced the EO content and EO yield of thyme by 17.1% and 42.7%, respectively. Based on the GC-MS and GC-FID analysis, 38 constituents were identified in the thyme EO, with the major constituents being thymol (35.64-41.31%), p-cymene (16.35-19.38%), ?-terpinene (12.61-13.98%) and carvacrol (2.78-3.93%) respectively. The highest content of thymol and ?-terpinene was obtained under moderate water stress (FC60) fertilized with AMF+CHT NPs. In addition, the highest content of p-cymene and carvacrol was observed in the severe water stress (FC40) fertilized with AMF+CHT NPs. The present research suggests that the co-application of AMF+CHT NPs represents a sustainable and eco-friendly strategy for improving the EO quantity and quality of thyme under water stress conditions.

Quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from managed biofuel plantations in a semi-arid landscape of Southern India	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Jatropha curcas L. and Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre, are promising biofuel species in peninsular India. We quantified greenhouse gas fluxes from managed 9 year old plantations of these species for all seasons in three consecutive years (2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015) using manually-operated closed chamber method. CH4, N2O and CO2 were analysed by using Varian 450-GC based on Gas Chromotography. The mean soil CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in the Jatropha curcas plantation recorded were 7.720 t ha(-1) y(-1), 0.023 t ha(-1) y(-1) and 0.017 t ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. While in Pongamia pinnata soil CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions were recorded to be 7.633 t ha(-1) y(-1), 0.008 t ha(-1) y(-1) and 0.019 t ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Our results indicate that Jatropha curcas has higher GHG emissions than Pongamia pinnata. A pronounced seasonal variability was observed in CH4, N2O and CO2 flux rates. The highest emissions for Jatropha curcas occur during rainy season, whereas for Pongamia pinnata it occurs during winter. Soil moisture and temperature being the most influencing factors for CO2 fluxes from soil. We conclude that these plantation has an effect on soil-atmosphere GHG exchanges and can act as a good source of mitigation of greenhouse gases.

During peak harvesting season, unavailability of labourers and need of timeliness of operation, burning of straw in field have been a conventional practice. Mechanization in this field has been low but loading/ unloading of loose straw is a tedious work. These operations can be performed efficiently using a tractor operated pneumatic loader and with less effort. Present study was aimed at optimizing the working of pneumatic loader at varying suction, delivery length and power take-off (PTO) speeds for wheat, soybean and pigeon pea straws. The optimized suction and delivery lengths for all the three straws were obtained as 2 and 10 m, respectively. The PTO speeds of 302, 366, and 373 rpm were identified as optimum for wheat, soybean, and pigeon pea straws, respectively. The operational cost of the machine with tractor was calculated as Rs. 228 for loading one tonne straw which resulted in heavy savings.

Evaluation confirmed a wide range of variability revealing significant response of main effects (lines, irrigations and years and their respective digenic and trigenic interactions). These lines were subjected to different stress regimes over years leading to identification of fifteen elite lines which performed well under droughtstress showing inbuilt drought tolerance. A set of 32 SSR markers, having genome-wide coverage, were chosen for genotyping the inbred lines. These markers generated a total of 239 polymorphic alleles with an average of 7.47 alleles per locus. The minimum and maximum PIC value was 0.886 and 0.608 with a mean of 0.782. The coefficient of genetic dissimilarity ranged from 0.215 to 0.148. DARwin derived cluster analysis grouped 15 elite maize lines in three major clusters with five lines each in cluster-III and II and four lines in cluster-I with KDM-361A as root. Molecular diversity however, confirmed diverse genetic nature of six lines (KDM-372, KDM-343A, KDM-331, KDM-961, KDM-1051 and KDM-1156) showing drought tolerance. Exploitation of identified elite lines in a crossing program involving all possible combinations would help to develop hybrids with inbuilt mechanism to drought tolerance. Markers viz., umc-1766, umc-1478 and phi-061 recorded PIC >8 and alleles per locus more than 9 and therefore, discriminated the set of lines more efficiently. Genotyping data complemented by morpho-physiological parameters were used to identify a number of pair-wise combinations for the development of mapping population segregating for drought tolerance and potential heterotic pairs for the development of drought tolerant hybrids.

(Poaceae), is widely distributed throughout Asia, causing frequent outbreaks and considerable yield losses. Mutants of the rice strain Samba Mahsuri (MSM) represent unique plant material and are explored here for the first time for resistance to the rice leaf folder. Stringent rapid field screening for two consecutive seasons led to the identification of 10 lines as moderately resistant, with low damage area as well as low damage score. Upon assessment of various morphological traits potentially contributing to the resistance, damage area was negatively correlated with leaf length and positively with leaf width. Among the biochemical traits, leaf nitrogen content was positively correlated with leaf folder damage whereas silica was negatively correlated. Oviposition preference by leaf folder adult moths and larval settling preference were low on MSM 139 and MSM 127. We also observed that leaf folder larvae took more time for leaf selection (3.1 min) and making a primary fold (41.5 min), with more head swings (846) in moderately resistant MSM lines. Similarly, in these lines, leaf folders showed a low intrinsic rate of increase (r(m) = 0.15 females per female per day), low weekly multiplication rate (2.85), and low net reproductive rate (R-0 = 137.5 females per female per generation) with increased generation time (T = 32.8 days) and doubling time (4.5 days), indicating their relatively poor population growth potential. Overall, the moderately resistant mutant lines we identified showed reduced ovipositional preference and larval settling preference, extended larval developmental period with low survival, reduced primary fold length, and an increased number of binds and head swings with a low intrinsic rate of increase resulting in reduced population build-up. These lines possessing a good genetic makeup have a great potential to be used in breeding programs for the development of leaf folder resistant varieties.

In this study, we assessed the effects on SOC fraction distribution and stability from four aspects of soil microbiological properties: soil microbial biomass (SMB), soil microbial activity, structure diversity, and functional diversity of soil microbial community in a Pinus tabuliformis plantation, which received four N addition levels (0 g N m(-2) y(-1) (N0), 3 g N m(-2) y(-1) (N3, low N addition), 6 g N m(-2) y(-1) (N6, mid-N addition), and 9 g N m(-2)y(-1) (N9, high N addition)) for 2 years. The N inputs did significantly affect some soil microbiological properties, like SMB, soil phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), and soil microbial functional diversity. Mid- and high N addition decreased the richness (HPLFA) and evenness (EPLFA) index of the soil microbial community, from 3.24 to 2.91 and 0.93 to 0.87, respectively. In addition, the low N addition promoted the carbon management index (CMI) to 141.35, i.e., higher than the CMIs in the mid- and high-level treatments. The SOC stability also showed significant differences among N addition treatments, and SOC could be the most stable at the mid-N addition level. Regarding the effects of the four soil microbiological attributes on the CMI and stability, SMB and soil respiration positively impacted the CMI, but did not significantly affect the stability. In addition, E-PLFA had positive effects, but EBIOLOG had negative effects on CMI and lability. Our findings indicate that soil microbiological properties are essential in SOC fractional distributions and stability. Further identification and study of soil microbial species used to change SOC fractions would help to clarify the detailed mechanisms involved.

To determine the effects of long-term fertilization on crop yield and carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) stoichiometry in soil, a study was conducted on the terraced fields of the Loess Plateau from 2007 to 2019. Nine fertilization treatments were included: no fertilizer; organic fertilizer (O); organic and nitrogen fertilizers (ON); organic, nitrogen, and phosphorus fertilizers (ONP); organic and phosphorus fertilizers (OP); phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers; potash and nitrogen fertilizers; potash, nitrogen, and phosphorus fertilizers; and potash and phosphorus fertilizers. Under these treatments except for CK and PK, crop yields initially decreased but later increased. The nutrient content and C:N:P stoichiometry increased in soil depth of 0-20 cm. The soil available nutrients did not change significantly with the duration of fertilization. The O, ON, ONP, and OP had the most evident effect on the enhancement of soil nutrient content, whereas O and ON had the most evident effect on the increase in soil organic carbon (SOC):total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN):TP. In soil depth of 0-20 cm, crop yield, SOC:TN, SOC:TN, SOC:TP, and TN:TP significantly correlated with soil nutrients. This study indicated that long-term fertilization can effectively improve crop yield, soil fertility, and soil C:N:P stoichiometry. Meanwhile, the single application of an organic fertilizer or the combination of organic and nitrogen fertilizers can improve the condition of nitrogen limitation in arid and semi-arid areas.

Drivers of compositional turnover are related to species' commonness in flea assemblages from four biogeographic realms: zeta diversity and multi-site generalised dissimilarity modelling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												We investigated drivers of species turnover in fleas parasitic on small mammals in four biogeographic realms using novel methodology (zeta diversity, and Multi-Site Generalised Dissimilarity Modelling). We asked whether (i) flea turnover was better explained by host turnover or environmental variables; (ii) different factors drive the turnover of rare and widespread fleas; (iii) the factors affecting the turnover of rare or widespread fleas differ between realms; and (iv) environmental variables drive flea turnover directly or via their effects on hosts. Dissimilarity in host species composition was the most important factor affecting flea turnover in all realms. In the Afrotropics, the Nearctic, and the Neotropics, this was true mainly for rare species, whereas the zeta diversity of the Palearctic hosts exerted a strong effect on the turnover of both rare and widespread fleas. Dissimilarity in temperature contributed the most to the turnover of rare fleas in the Neotropics and the Palearctic, whereas the turnover of widespread species in these realms was strongly affected by dissimilarity in precipitation. In the Nearctic, dissimilarity in precipitation or temperature mostly affected the turnover of rare fleas or common species, respectively. In the Afrotropics, dissimilarity in the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and temperature affected the turnover of all species, independently of their level of commonness, while dissimilarity in rainfall was important for the turnover of rare fleas. The responses of flea assemblages to environmental factors represented a combination of direct responses and responses mediated via effects on host turnover. We conclude that host turnover is a more important factor than environmental dissimilarity in its effect on flea species turnover. However, the relative effects of host composition and environment, as well as those of temperature, precipitation and the amount of vegetation, on flea turnover differ (i) between realms and (ii) between rare and common fleas.

However, the relationship between sowing date and water uptake in intercropping is not yet well understood. A two-year field trial was conducted to explore the impacts of sowing date on water uptake patterns of maize and soybean across different seasons using stable isotopes & delta;18O and & delta;2H in plant and soil water along with MixSIAR modeling. Three sowing times with intercropping systems (two-row maize and four-row soybean) were used: M2S4 (maize sowed at the same time as soybean), M2s4 (soybean sowed 4 weeks later than maize), and m2S4 (maize sowed 4 weeks later than soybean). Maize water absorption depths in intercrop systems were 0-20 cm (47.2 %), 20-150 cm (56.5 %), and 70-200 cm (72.9 %) for M2S4, 0-20 cm (45.1 %), 70-200 cm (59.8 %), and 70-150 cm (59.2 %) for M2s4, and 0-20 cm (51.7 %), 20-150 cm (58.5 %), and 20-150 cm (63.1 %) for m2S4 at jointing, silking, and maturity stages, respectively. Soybean water uptake depth was 0-20 cm for intercrops with different sowing dates. Delayed sowing of intercropped soybean or maize had no effect on the soybean water uptake depth. With delayed soybean sowing, the main water absorption depth during the growth period of intercropped maize was first deeper and then shallower. With delayed maize sowing, the water absorption depth of intercropped maize became shallower in the late growth stage. Land (1.01-1.34) and water (0.93-1.33) equivalent ratios indicated variations in the impact of intercropping sowing dates on yield and water use effi-ciency with the greatest ratios observed in M2s4 intercrop. The M2s4 model is considered to be the optimal planting time for intercropping systems on the Loess Plateau.

However, quantifying the influence of revegetation on the erosion caused by concentrated runoff in extreme rainstorms is still challenging. To evaluate this influence, scouring-erosion experiments were implemented in situ on the vegetated hillslope plots (GR) and bare hillslope plots (CK). The runoff -reducing effects of grass (GRR) averaged 31%, 20% and 8%, and the erosion-reducing effects of grass (GER) averaged 93%, 95% and 93% on the 5 degrees-plots, 10 degrees-plots and 18 degrees-plots, respectively. The ratios of GRR to GER were 0.09-0.33, implying that the ability of vegetation to reduce erosion was greater than its ability to reduce runoff. The GRR and GER obviously decreased as the inflow rate increased, and the GRR decreased as the hillslope gradient increased, but there were no obvious differences in the GER between hillslope gradients. Vegetation could decrease the ability of the concentrated flow to carry and transport sediment and increase the energy consumption of the concentrated flow in response to hydraulic resistance. Vegetation also significantly reduced the degree of rill development. The degree of rill dissection on the GR (0.054-0.087 m2 m-2) was lower than that on the CK (0.061-0.184 m2 m-2). Our findings provide an essential reference for ecological environment and vegetation restoration on loess hillslopes.(c) 2022 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research.

Through seedling and ramet monitoring and adult surveying on 12 three-year-old landslide scars on the hilly and gullied Loess Plateau, China, we characterized seedling and ramet recruitment in terms of their trade-offs, processes and amounts, and we also assessed compositional correspondence between the adult and young (all seedlings and ramets combined) layers. We found that when seedling recruitment was employed in tandem with ramet recruitment, which might maximize colonists' fitness. Moreover, seedlings and ramets emerged constantly and were followed by low mortality rates. However, there were problems of emergence limitation and constant death, and, as a result, seedlings and ramets remained at low densities. Therefore, there appeared to be a slow and limited recruitment process of plant colonists on the scars. In addition, there was a high degree of compositional uncoupling between the adult and young layers, implying future potential changes of plant communities driven by Poa sphondylodes Trin., Stipa bungeana Trin., Ixeridium sonchifolium (Maxim.) Shih, Astragalus discolor Bunge ex Maxim. and Artemisia scoparia Waldst. et Kit. on shady scars and I. sonchifolium (Maxim.) Shih on sunny scars. We also proposed that the first three species can be used to restore landslide scars in the study area.

However, the extent to which plant resistance is associated with the nitrogen (N) supply in symbiont is still uncertain. This study investigates the effect of urea or/and rhizobium (Sinorhizobium meliloti) application on the growth of Medicago sativa and resistance in metals contaminated soil (mainly with Cu). The results show that Cu uptake in plant shoots increased by 41.7%, 69%, and 89.3% with urea treatment, rhizobium inoculation, and their combined treatment, respectively, compared to the control group level. In plant roots, the corresponding values were 1.9-, 1.7-, and 1.5-fold higher than the control group values, respectively. Statistical analysis identified that N content was the dominant variable contributing to Cu uptake in plants. Additionally, a negative correlation was observed between plant oxidative stress and N content, indicating that N plays a key role in plant resistance. Oxidative damage decreased after rhizobium inoculation as the activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase in roots and peroxidase in plant shoots) were stimulated, enhancing plant resistance and promoting plant growth. Our results suggest that individual rhizobium inoculation, without urea treatment, is the most recommended approach for effective phytoremediation of contaminated land.

Here, we used two different biochars, apple tree branch biochar and maize stalk biochar, and simulated the aging process by using freeze-thaw cycles, dry-wet cycles, and chemical oxidation methods. We investigated the changes in the physicochemical properties and Pb adsorption behavior of the biochars before and after aging treatments. The characterization results showed that the biochar surface structure changed after aging treatments. In general, the specific surface areas (SSAs) of the two biochars increased after chemical oxidation treatment but decreased after the other two treatments. The elemental content analyses indicated a decrease in the C content and increase in 0 content after artificial aging. In addition, the content of oxygen-containing functional groups in most biochars is increasing after treatment. The increase or decrease in SSA resulted in an increase or decrease in adsorption sites, respectively, thereby enhancing or reducing the adsorption capacity of the biochar. Furthermore, oxygen-containing functional groups enhanced the Pb adsorption capacity of biochar by complexation of free carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups with Pb. Our research indicated that aging can lead to changes in the Pb adsorption capacity of biochar and that these changes vary depending on the type of aging and biochar. Our results will help to provide a better understanding of the changes in physicochemical properties and Pb adsorption capacity of biochar during the aging process in soil toward making full use of biochar for soil amendment.

J	Zhang, Q; Fan, J; Jia, ML; Shi, CC				Zhang, Qian; Fan, Jun; Jia, Mulin; Shi, Changchun			Impacts of long-term abandonment of alfalfa plantations on soil physicochemical properties and plant diversity in an agricultural pastoral ecotone	PLANT AND SOIL												Background and aimsThe abandonment of alfalfa fields is increasing in a semi-arid region. To determine the change of soil physicochemical properties and plant diversity in abandoned alfalfa fields for a long-term is essential for vegetation restoration. This study surveyed alfalfa fields of different planting ages in 2003 (1-30 years), 2014 (12-41 years), and 2022 (20-49 years) to explore the change in various indicators using a space-for-time method.ResultsThe results suggested that abandoned alfalfa fields converted into natural grasslands after 15 years, where the abundances of Gramineae and Asteraceae (59.1-84.0%) increased, whereas those of legumes decreased (16.5-9.4%). As the plant composition changed, the soil water content (SWC) decreased by 19.0% 1-15 years after abandonment, but increased by 54.5% 15-49 years after abandonment. The plant diversity (Margalef, Pielou, Simpson, and Shannon-Wiener indices), and soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) contents increased by 0.5% to 51.5% with the number of years alfalfa planting. Furthermore, the plant composition significantly affected the SWC through the soil physicochemical characteristics and plant diversity.ConclusionsThis study demonstrated that the longest time of alfalfa planting was 15 years. Furthermore, the plant composition changed from alfalfa to local grasses due to the natural succession of abandoned alfalfa fields, with increases in SWC, SOC, TN, and plant diversity in the semi-arid region.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				2023 SEP 1	2023										10.1007/s11104-023-06246-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06246-6		SEP 2023											WOS:001059898900003

M.; Chen, Yinglong			Nitrogen supply improved plant growth and Cd translocation in maize at the silking and physiological maturity under moderate Cd stress	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Soil cadmium (Cd) contamination is a serious problem on agricultural land. Adequate nitrogen (N) may help ameliorate plant fitness under Cd stress. This study examined the role of N application in improving maize tolerance to Cd stress. Two maize genotypes, Zhongkell (larger root system) and Shengrui999 (smaller root system), were grown in a loessal soil amended with Cd (CdO, no added Cd; Cd1, 20 mg kg(-1) soil as CdCl2 center dot 2.5 H2O) and N (NO, no added N; N1, 100 mg kg(-1) soil as urea) under greenhouse, and plants were assessed at silking and maturity stages. Maize plants exhibited moderate Cd stress with significantly reduced grain yield, especially under low N (N1). Roots accumulated more Cd than above-ground parts. Grain Cd concentration was the least (0.05-0.06 mu g g(-1)) among all organs which is below the safety threshold. Leaf Cd concentrations (0.24-1.18 mg kg(-1)) were also under the toxicity threshold. Nitrogen addition significantly improved plant growth, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis traits, and tissue Cd contents, and reduced Cd concentration in soil compared to NO treatment. Nitrogen promoted Cd bioconcentration and translocation factors in stem and leaves. Cadmium stress reduced N fertilizer agronomic efficiency at maturity. At maturity, root Cd content was positively correlated with root N and calcium accumulation, and stem Cd content was positively correlated with stem N content (both P <= 0.05). Genotypes with different root system size differed in response to Cd toxicity and / or N deficit. The small-rooted genotype Shengrui999 was more tolerant to moderate Cd stress than the large-rooted Zhongkell. Addition of N ameliorated Cd stress in both maize genotypes by improving plant growth performance, and regulating Cd translocation among plant organs.

The use of nitrate to facilitate plant excess anion uptake has shown the potential to increase soil pH. A column experiment was carried out to demonstrate this root-induced alkalization in various depths in an acid soil with pH 4.28 (0.01 M CaCl2). It consisted of two types of nitrogen (N) fertilizers (urea and Ca(NO3)(2), both at 5 atom% N-15 enrichment) banded at a depth of 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm or 20-30 cm, with phosphorus (P) fertilizer (NaH2PO4) at 150 mg P per column either applied to the N layers (N+P) or evenly mixed into the remaining layers without N addition (N-P). Aluminium-tolerant wheat (ET8) was used as test plants, receiving an initial N dose of 60 mg kg(-1) soil at sowing and an additional dose of 30 mg kg(-1) every 10 days from 40 days after sowing. Plants had a total N supply of 90 mg N kg(-1) at 50 days and 180 mg N kg(-1) at 80 days after sowing. The N+P treatments increased plant N uptake and increased rhizosphere and bulk soil pH. Nitrate placement increased pH of treated layers by up to 0.4 and 0.2 units in the rhizosphere and bulk soils, respectively, compared with the control at Day 80. Rhizosphere alkalization was greater with deeper N+P treatments as these encouraged the proliferation of deeper roots in the treated layer. The form of N and the application method of P fertilizer had no effect on shoot biomass over 80 days of growth. The N+P treatments had 7% higher N-15 recovery of fertilizer in plants than the N-P treatments. The current study also showed that P fertilizer enhanced rhizosphere alkalization induced by calcium nitrate. The results suggest that the use of nitrate fertilizer with P treatments can facilitate alkalization of acid subsoils. Highlights Phosphorus facilitates amelioration of subsurface soil acidity with nitrate fertilizer Placement of nitrate induces alkalization of acid soil at various depths Combined addition of nitrate and P at depth enhances nitrate uptake by wheat Balanced nutrient supply enhances excess anion uptake and rhizosphere alkalization					Li, Guangdi/B-8515-2011	Li, Guangdi/0000-0002-4841-3803; Weng, Zhe (Han)/0000-0002-9567-095X; Sale, Peter/0000-0002-2426-3724													1351-0754	1365-2389				JAN	2022	73	1								10.1111/ejss.13153	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.13153		AUG 2021											WOS:000684022300001

Photocatalysis is considered to be one of the most promising technologies to solve the problems of energy shortage and environmental pollution in the future. It has been used to degrade organic pollutants. However,there are still many problems in the application of photocatalysts,such as low photon efficiency, high recombination rate of photoinduced electron hole pairs or poor stability. In order to expand the industrial application of photocatalytic technology, the modification of photocatalyst is an important direction to improve the utilization of solar energy. ZnO has the advantages of good photosensitivity,non toxicity,high electron mobility and low cost,but it is a wide band gap semiconductor,only responds to ultraviolet light,and the photon utilization is low. Bismuth oxyhalide BiOX(X= Cl,Br,I)has attracted extensive attention because of its special structure and excellent photocatalytic performance. As a typical bismuth halide oxide photocatalyst,BiOBr has a suitable band gap(2.61 eV),which makes it have the characteristics of good activity and stable photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation. Therefore, it has become one of the materials that can not be ignored in the field of photocatalytic degradation of water pollution. However,the photocatalytic effect of pure BiOBr is poor. The combination of BiOBr and ZnO to form ZnO/BiOBr heterojunction can improve the photocatalytic activity of single component semiconductor photocatalytic materials and broaden the application range of ZnO and BiOBr. In previous studies,the binary composite ZnO/ BiOBr was synthesized by hydrothermal method,and the dye degradation experiment was carried out to improve the photocatalytic degradation activity of single component. SHASHA Y et al. prepared ZnO/BiOBr complex by two-step hydrothermal method and showed excellent catalytic activity for the photodegradation of Methyl Orange(MO). GENG Y G et al. synthesized flower like ZnO/ BiOBr by hydrothermal method,showing good photocatalytic degradation ability for Methyl Blue (MB). MENG X C et al. synthesized binary heterojunction ZnO/BiOBr by hydrothermal method. The photodegradation ability of Rhodamine B(RhB)was obviously better than that of single component. In previous studies,ZnO/ BiOBr binary composites were synthesized by hydrothermal method,and some were synthesized by two- step method. This subject tried to synthesize ZnO/ BiOBr with different morphology in one step by adding some ethylene glycol solvent. Although the photocatalytic activity could not be compared with previous studies due to different reaction conditions and degradation substrates,ZnO/ BiOBr(1:2) with high catalytic degradation activity was selected in this work. ZnO/BiOBr composite photocatalysts with different ratios of ZnO and BiOBr(1:1,1:2,1:3,2:1,2:3,3:1 and 3:2)were prepared. When the molar ratio of ZnO to BiOBr was 1:2,the photocatalytic degradation performance of ZnO/BiOBr composite was the best. Under visible light for 120 min,the removal rate of Rhodamine B (RhB)(20 mg/L) was 98.89% and the degradation rate constant was 0.040 50 min-1, which was 4 times that of pure BiOBr. The binary composites ZnO/BiOBr were detected through X- ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, high resolution TEM, UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy, photoluminescence analysis and electron spin resonance spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscope analysis found that ZnO and BiOBr were successfully compounded. The scanning electron microscope analysis results showed that the the binary composite ZnO/BiOBr with different molar ratios showed flake structures of different sizes,and granular ZnO could not be seen on the surface of flake structures. Among them,the flake structure size of ZnO/BiOBr(1:2)sample was the largest. UV- vis diffuse reflectance analysis showed that compared with pure ZnO,the band gap decreased significantly after BiOBr and ZnO were combined,indicating that the utilization range of spectrum was improved,which was beneficial to the improvement of photocatalytic performance. Photoluminescence analysis showed that the peak intensity of ZnO/BiOBr (1:2) binary composite was between pure ZnO and BiOBr,indicating that the addition of BiOBr improved the utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes in pure ZnO. The results of reuse experiment showed that after repeatedly degrading Rhodamine B(RhB)5 times,ZnO/BiOBr(1:2) still maintained high activity,and the degradation rate of Rhodamine B decreased by 9%,indicating that the composite photocatalyst ZnO/ BOBr(1:2)had good stability. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy results showed that a large number of center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH radicals were indeed produced in ZnO/BiOBr(1:2) photocatalytic system. Therefore,it could be preliminarily concluded that center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH radicals were important active species in ZnO/BiOBr (1: 2) photocatalytic reaction system. Combined with the theoretical analysis of semiconductor energy band,the existence of center dot O-2(-) and center dot OH radicals was confirmed again,and the organics were degraded into small molecular substances through their oxidation. The photocatalytic degradation mechanism showed that the interface electric field was formed in the photocatalytic process of ZnO/BiOBr (1:2) to inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. All results suggested that the ZnO/BiOBr(1:2) composite with high photocatalytic degradation efficiency,excellent recyclability and stability can meet a potentially promising application for photocatalytic degradation of waste water.

Methods The correlations between root traits and the amount of carbon (C) allocated to different orders of roots were tested using C-13 pulse labeling. The amount of C-13 was measured by quantifying the CO2 emitted from respiring roots of Pinus tabuliformis excised 0, 1, 3, 9, 21, 81 and 120 days after labeling. Results 1) Moderate drought stress significantly increased the root to shoot biomass ratio, the biomass ratio of the first three orders to the 4th- and 5th-order roots, and the cumulative root length and root area of the 1st-order roots. 2) 120 days after labeling, C-13 amount allocated to 1st- and 2nd-order roots was significantly higher in all drought stress treatments than adequate water supply treatment, with the exception of C-13 in 1st-order roots undergoing the severe drought stress treatment. Root respiration was significantly and positively correlated with C-13 in the 1st- and 2nd-order roots in all drought stress treatments. 3) The C-13 ratios of all the droughted treatments vs water supply treatment were significantly higher in the 1st- and 2nd-order roots than in the 4th- and 5th-order roots, with the exception of the 1st-order roots in the most severe drought treatment. Conclusions Drought stress elevated C demand in lower-order roots by increasing the lower-order root respiration rate and by expanding the photosynthate allocation to the fine roots to enhance their structural growth.

Park; Zhang, Yao			Exceptional heat and atmospheric dryness amplified losses of primary production during the 2020 US Southwest hot drought	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Earth's ecosystems are increasingly threatened by "hot drought," which occurs when hot air temperatures coincide with precipitation deficits, intensifying the hydrological, physiological, and ecological effects of drought by enhancing evaporative losses of soil moisture (SM) and increasing plant stress due to higher vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Drought-induced reductions in gross primary production (GPP) exert a major influence on the terrestrial carbon sink, but the extent to which hotter and atmospherically drier conditions will amplify the effects of precipitation deficits on Earth's carbon cycle remains largely unknown. During summer and autumn 2020, the U.S. Southwest experienced one of the most intense hot droughts on record, with record-low precipitation and record-high air temperature and VPD across the region. Here, we use this natural experiment to evaluate the effects of hot drought on GPP and further decompose those negative GPP anomalies into their constituent meteorological and hydrological drivers. We found a 122 Tg C (>25%) reduction in GPP below the 2015-2019 mean, by far the lowest regional GPP over the Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite record. Roughly half of the estimated GPP loss was attributable to low SM (likely a combination of record-low precipitation and warming-enhanced evaporative depletion), but record-breaking VPD amplified the reduction of GPP, contributing roughly 40% of the GPP anomaly. Both air temperature and VPD are very likely to continue increasing over the next century, likely leading to more frequent and intense hot droughts and substantially enhancing drought-induced GPP reductions.

However, the patterns and drivers of soil microbial metabolism in the alpine grassland at different altitudes under warming remain poorly understood. Here, according to soil enzymatic stoichiometry, we observed that microbial metabolism was limited by C and phosphorus (P) in the alpine grassland ecosystem, eastern Tibetan Plateau, and microbial C limitation increased with altitude from 3800 to 4200 m despite the topsoil (0-5 cm) or subsoil (5-10 cm). Experimental warming significantly decreased microbial C limitation in the topsoil, but not the subsoil. The significantly negative correlation between microbial C and P limitation in both topsoil and subsoil suggests that the alleviation of C limitation after warming may aggravate the microbial P limitation. Furthermore, the contents and ratio of nutrients and microbial biomass mainly affected microbial C and P limitation in the alpine grassland, respectively.

This study provides an insight into the microbial regulation of nutrient cycles global warming, which is helpful for ecosystem C cycling in alpine grassland.

Contribution of land use to the interannual variability of the land carbon cycle	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Understanding the driving mechanisms of the interannual variability (IAV) of the net land carbon balance (S-net) is important to predict future climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. Past studies showed that the IAV of S-net was correlated with tropical climate variation and controlled by semiarid vegetation. But today's land ecosystems are also under extensive human land use and management. Here, we report a previously hidden role of land use in driving the IAV of S-net by using an improved biosphere model. We found that managed land accounted for 30-45% of the IAV of S-net over 1959-2015, while the contribution of intact land is reduced by more than half compared with previous assessments of the global carbon budget. Given the importance of land use in modulating future land climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, climate mitigation efforts should strive to reduce land-use emissions and enhance the climate resilience of carbon sinks over managed land. Terrestrial carbon uptake as high inter-annual variability which can be used to help understand future responses to climate change. Here the authors' modeling reveals a large portion of this variability is driven by human land use changes and management, and not captured by other models.

They function mainly as translational repressors in mammals. Therefore, how to identify miRNAs is one of the most important problems in medical treatment. Many known pre-miRNAs have a hairpin ring structure containing more structural features, and it is difficult to identify mature miRNAs because of their short length. Therefore, most research focuses on the identification of pre-miRNAs. Most computational models rely on manual feature extraction to identify pre-miRNAs and do not consider the sequential and spatial characteristics of pre-miRNAs, resulting in a loss of information. As the number of unidentified pre-miRNAs is far greater than that of known pre-miRNAs, there is a dataset imbalance problem, which leads to a degradation of the performance of pre-miRNA identification methods. In order to overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose a pre-miRNA identification algorithm based on a cascaded CNN-LSTM framework, called CL-PMI. We used a convolutional neural network to automatically extract features and obtain pre-miRNA spatial information. We also employed long short-term memory (LSTM) to capture time characteristics of pre-miRNAs and improve attention mechanisms for long-term dependence modeling. Focal loss was used to improve the dataset imbalance. Compared with existing methods, CL-PMI achieved better performance on all datasets. The results demonstrate that this method can effectively identify pre-miRNAs by simultaneously considering their spatial and sequential information, as well as dealing with imbalance in the datasets.

Previous studies mostly focused on the impact of shrub encroachment on vegetation communities, but few studies were focused on the impact of shrub encroachment on soil pH. This study shed light on this topic by measuring soil moisture and water holding capacity under different levels of shrub encroachment (shrub coverage ranging from 8% to 90%) in alpine meadows located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Results showed that the intensification of shrub encroachment increased soil saturated water content, soil capillary moisture capacity and soil field capacity, but decreased soil moisture at the uppermost soil layer (0-10 cm). The increase of soil saturated water content and soil capillary moisture capacity increased soil pH. The intensification of shrub encroachment increased soil pH at soil depth of 0-10 cm, but decreased soil pH at soil depth of 20-30 cm. Overall, shrub encroachment could increase soil water and salt upward transport by reducing soil moisture and enhancing soil capillary moisture capacity, resulting in an increase of soil pH. These findings are conducive to better understand the impact of shrub encroachment on the redistribution of soil salinity in alpine meadows, and can provide a theoretical basis for predicting the changes of alpine meadow community facing future climatic change and human activities.

Colonization of a novel host by fleas: changes in egg production and egg size	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												We studied the success of fleas, Synosternus cleopatrae and Xenopsylla ramesis, in switching to a novel host by establishing experimental lines maintained on different hosts for 18 generations. Fleas fed on principal (P-line) or novel hosts, either sympatric with (S-line) or allopatric to (A-line) a flea and its principal host, then we assessed their reproductive performance via the number and size of eggs. We compared reproductive performance between hosts within a line and between lines within a host asking: (a) whether fleas adapt to a novel host species after multiple generations; (b) if yes, whether the pattern of adaptation differs between novel host species sympatric with or allopatric to a flea and its principal host; and (c) adaptation to a novel host is accompanied with a loss of success in exploitation of an original host. Fleas from the S- and A-lines increased their egg production on a novel host (except X. ramesis from the S-line). S. cleopatrae from the S-line but not the A-line increased egg size on a novel host, whereas X. ramesis from the A-line but not the S-line produced larger eggs from a novel host. We found no indication of a loss of reproductive performance on the original host while adapting to a novel host. We conclude that fleas are able to switch rapidly to a new host with the pattern of a switch to either sympatric or an allopatric host depending on the identities of both flea and host species.					van der Mescht, Luther/J-8349-2019; Krasnov, Boris R./ABG-8403-2021; Khokhlova, Irina/F-2235-2012	van der Mescht, Luther/0000-0001-8813-9549; Krasnov, Boris R./0000-0002-0382-3331; Khokhlova, Irina/0000-0003-0169-7770													0932-0113	1432-1955				FEB	2021	120	2					451	459		10.1007/s00436-021-07052-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07052-8		JAN 2021						33447886					WOS:000607762000001

The exploration of high-resolution, multispectral optical satellite data for vegetable mapping is hindered by heavy rainfall, clouds, and year-round fog/snow cover. Hyperspectral imaging is restricted in the region that borders several international countries because of security concerns. In the global literature on spectroscopy, information on vegetable crops cultivated in the Himalayan ecosystem is marginal or never covered. Thus, we used a portable Field Spec Handheld2 (ASD) spectroradiometer for spectral characterization of 28 important vegetables, from 10 different families. During the summer and winter seasons of 2020-2022, they were grown without stress and in good health in the experimental field at Umiam, Meghalaya. The ground radiometer was able to achieve a spectral resolution of <3 nm in the 325 to 1075 nm wavelength range. At critical growth stages, data were acquired on cloudless days in 1100 and 1300 nm, with a height of 1 m above the crop and a field of view (FOV) <25. Cropspecific sensitive wavebands were identified and estimated 12 vegetation indices (VI) that relate to biophysical and biochemical properties for crop discrimination. The near infrared region (NIR: 700-1070 nm) was effective for crop discrimination. Of the 10 families, the mean NDVI values varied in the following descending order: Umbelliferae(0.878) > Malvaceae(0.863) > Cucurbitaceae(0.802) > Lamiaceae(0.732) > Solanaceae(0.721) > Leguminosae(0.651) > Cruciferae (0.607) > Amarantha ceae(0.604) > Zingiberaceae(0.595) > Liliaceae(0.531). Among vegetables, the highest NDVI was reported for Fenugreek (0.922) and the lowest for Broccoli (0.421). The position on the red edge (700-750 nm) varied greatly. Similarly, crop families had varying VI values for chlorophyll, carotenoid, xanthophyll and anthocyanin pigments. The ranges of these indices were defined as healthy or stressed crops for the region. From the multi-season spectral signature, a spectral crop library (CSL) for all vegetables was developed under clearly defined conditions (e.g. growth stage, time and year, soil, cultivar type, and climate). The CSL generated from the study provides a reference spectral source for spatial mapping and quantitative spectral modelling to assess crop conditions and prescribe measures. This will be a crucial step in promoting precision agriculture in the eastern Himalayas and other similar ecosystems.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				NOV	2023	77								102263	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102263	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102263		AUG 2023											WOS:001063146700001

Feeding performance on a novel host: no adaptation over generations and differential patterns in two flea species	PARASITOLOGY												To model the colonization of a novel host by fleas, Synosternus cleopatrae and Xenopsylla ramesis, we established experimental lines maintained for 15 generations on a principal or a novel host (either co-occurring with a flea or not). We compared the blood meal size and the energy expended for digestion by fleas from the 15(th) generation of each line on these hosts between hosts within a line and between lines within a host asking (a) whether fleas adapt to a novel host (increased blood consumption/decreased energy expended for digestion); (b) if yes, whether this adaptation leads to the loss of ability to exploit an original host, and (c) whether the success of adaptation to a novel host depends on its ecological co-occurrence with a flea. The blood consumption and digestion energetics of fleas fed on the principal host differed from those on other hosts. The effect of the principal host on feeding performance differed between fleas, with S. cleopatrae consuming less blood and expending more energy for digestion on the principal than on any other host, whereas the opposite was true for X. ramesis. No changes in feeding performance on a novel host over generations were found. We propose several explanations for the lack of adaptation to a novel host over time. We explain the poor performance of S. cleopatrae on its principal host via its immune response mounting pattern. We argue that the principal host of a parasite is not necessarily the host on which the parasite demonstrates the best performance.					van der Mescht, Luther/J-8349-2019; Krasnov, Boris R./ABG-8403-2021; Khokhlova, Irina/F-2235-2012	van der Mescht, Luther/0000-0001-8813-9549; Krasnov, Boris R./0000-0002-0382-3331; Khokhlova, Irina/0000-0003-0169-7770; Warburton, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8125-2741													0031-1820	1469-8161				MAY	2020	147	6					721	728	PII S0031182020000244	10.1017/S0031182020000244	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182020000244								32046805					WOS:000531549800013
J	Wang, D; Wang, L; Zhang, R				Wang, Di; Wang, Li; Zhang, Rui			Measurement and modeling of canopy interception losses by two differently aged apple orchards in a subhumid region of the Yellow River Basin	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Canopy interception (Ic) of rainwater is an important component of hydrological cycles, and its measurement and modeling are essential for understanding water balances and formulating scientific strategies of management in different ecosystems. Large areas of traditional agricultural crops have been replaced with apple orchards in the Yellow River Basin, while few studies were conducted to quantify and model canopy interception for apple orchards with different ages. In this work, we measured rainfall, stemflow and throughfall and calculated Ic for young and mature apple orchards from May to September 2013-2016 in Changwu County on the Loess Plateau in the Yellow River Basin. The revised Gash model was applied to the two orchards. The results revealed that annual Ic for the young (range 22.2-29.2 mm) and mature (range 26.8-39.7 mm) orchards varied between years. During the past four years, cumulative modeled Ic was 7.6 +/- 1.0 and 10.5 +/- 0.9% higher than cumulative measured Ic for the young and mature orchards, respectively. Evaluation parameters the mean root mean square error and bias values (0.1719 mm and 0.0372 mm, respectively) between the measured and modeled Ic implied that the revised model performed better for the young orchard. For both orchards, the revised model was most sensitive to the ratio of mean evaporation rate to mean rainfall intensity and canopy storage capacity each year. The good agreement between the measured and modeled Ic indicated that the revised model was suitable for predicting Ic for apple orchards with different ages under our climatic conditions or similar conditions.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				JUL 1	2022	269								107667	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107667	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107667		APR 2022											WOS:000794146600005

Effects of ectoparasite infestation during pregnancy on physiological stress and reproductive output in a rodent-flea system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												Biotic and abiotic stressors impose various fitness costs on individuals across a variety of taxa. In verte-brates, these stressors typically trigger complex neuroendocrine responses that stimulate glucocorticoid (GC) secretion from the adrenal cortex. Short-term elevation of GCs can be adaptive as it shifts energy toward physiological processes that cope with acute stressors; however, chronic increases in GC levels could have detrimental effects on fitness. Parasitism can be considered an important biotic stressor in nature and a possible cause of reproductive failure that could substantially affect an individual's fitness. Thus, we aimed to test the effects of parasitism and maternal stress, as measured by GCs, during preg-nancy and the relationship between these variables and measures of reproductive output using a rodent-flea system. Female Egyptian spiny mice (Acomys cahirinus) were randomly assigned to flea (Parapulex chephrenis) infested or uninfested treatments before and during pregnancy. The offspring of these females were flea-free. Feces were collected at five time points during the experiment to determine maternal fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGCM) concentrations. Overall, infested females had lower FGCM levels during gestation but higher FGCM levels post-parturition and larger mass changes than uninfested females. Additionally, models related to pup quality and quantity often included some mea-sure of maternal investment or body condition moderating relationships between infestation and stress. This suggests that flea parasitism or high GC levels alone might not significantly impact host reproduc-tion but rather females can experience different effects depending on their level of investment, which could be limited by body condition and/or the number of pups present in a litter.

Area of study: A rice-wheat rotation area in central China. Material and methods: A 35-yr long-term fertilizer experiment was conducted with 9 treatments: unfertilized (Control), N, P, and K fertilizers, manure (M) and M combined with N, P, and K fertilizers treatments. Soil total N input amount, total N concentration, total N storage amount and N sequestration rate in soil were calculated. Main results: The soil total N input amount, N concentration, N storage amount and N sequestration rate were significantly influenced by M and chemical fertilizers. In total, 0.017-0.021 g N/kg soil accumulated in the organic M plots, whereas only 0.005-0.007 g in chemical fertilizer alone plots. The highest soil total N storage amount was 6.09 t/ha in the M alone plot, and the lowest value was 4.46 t N/ha in the N fertilizer alone plot. The highest N sequestration rate in soil was 0.061 t N/ha/yr in the high amount M plus NPK fertilizers plot, and the lowest value was 0.002 t N/ha/yr in the N fertilizer alone plot. A significant nonlinear regression relationship existed between the total N sequestration rate in soil and annual total N input amount. Moreover, the average soil total N concentration was significantly positively correlated with the average grain yield of crop and soil organic C concentration. The soil total N sequestration rate in M alone or M combined with inorganic fertilizer treatments were increased compared with inorganic fertilizer alone treatments. Research highlights: Considering crop yields and total N sequestration rate in soil, the use of manure combined with inorganic fertilizer should be recommended in the rice-wheat cropping system.																			1695-971X	2171-9292					2020	18	1							e1102	10.5424/sjar/2020181-15691	http://dx.doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2020181-15691													WOS:000540720000021

The model consists of four coupled reaction-diffusion equations, and its steady localized solutions therefore obey an eight-dimensional spatial dynamical system in one spatial dimension (1D). Stationary localized structures within the model are found to be associated with a subcritical Turing instability and organized within a distinct type of foliated snaking bifurcation structure. This behavior is in turn associated with the presence of an exchange point in parameter space at which the complex leading spatial eigenvalues of the uniform concentration state are overtaken by a pair of real eigenvalues; this point plays the role of a Belyakov-Devaney point in this system. The primary foliated snaking structure consists of periodic spike or peak trains with N identical equidistant peaks, N=1,2, ..., together with cross-links consisting of nonidentical, nonequidistant peaks. The structure is complicated by a multitude of multipulse states, some of which are also computed, and spans the parameter range from the primary Turing bifurcation all the way to the fold of the N=1 state. These states form a complex template from which localized physical structures develop in the transverse direction in 2D.

LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Although afforestation of nitrogen-fixing shrubs, especially Caragana korshinskii in semiarid areas, is expected to improve ecosystem restoration and carbon sequestration, water shortage induced by these thirsty shrubs may negate potential benefits. Yet there is poor understating of the persistence of soil carbon sequestration in nitrogen-fixing shrub plantations. Here, we selected three C. korshinskii plantations with different ages (10, 20, and 30 years) on the Loess Plateau to evaluate the persistence of soil carbon sink. We examined dynamics of soil carbon, total nitrogen, and soil water, as well as their relationships along the plantation ages. The results showed that soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) were tightly coupled. SOC, STN, and soil water stocks (0-100 cm) were significantly decreased by 23.9%, 19.9%, and 29.2% from 10 to 30 years, respectively. The reduction of SOC and STN was likely caused by lowered intercanopy herbaceous productivity due to soil drying and intensified competition from shrubs. We present evidence that the positive carbon sequestration by afforestation of leguminous shrub in short term may be further weakened by water shortage, making our ability to restore degraded land in semiarid regions more challenging than previously thought. Therefore, it is essential to improve management of afforestation land such as thinning for maintaining SOC sequestration persistently in water-limited areas.

Frost response in wheat and early detection using proximal sensors	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE												Frost can significantly reduce production of field crops grown in Mediterranean-type environments, where significant economic losses for Australian wheat occur annually. If non-destructive sensors could make rapid, spatial assessment of frost damage, this could limit economic losses through timely management decisions. This paper reports on a methodology for imposing frost treatments to wheat under field conditions and the utility of canopy reflectance data for detecting early crop damage. Purpose-built chambers using stepped additions of dry ice allowed for a range of frost scenarios to be tested when applied at wheat heading and anthesis. For frost treatments applied at anthesis, grain number and yield were reduced by 8.8% and 7.2%, respectively, for every degree Celsius below zero (down to -4 degrees C). This effect was additive over two consecutive nights. For cold load equivalent, there was a 2.2% and 1.9% reduction in grain number and yield, respectively, per degrees C hr (below 0 degrees C). For wheat, spectral indices PRI and NDVI (reflectance) and FRF_G and SFR_G (fluorescence) showed significant relationships, with cold load applied for heading treatments. Next steps include targeting frost intensities equivalent to cold loads between 20 and 80 degrees C hr and testing the utility of these proposed indices in a commercial paddock setting.

Taking Lhasa River Basin as a representative, investigating the spatial variation and influencing factors in this area will help to understand the current status and mechanism of gully erosion. However, gully erosion factor analysis has not been carried out at the regional scale. Therefore, three machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression, were used to analyze 2224 samples and 18 influencing factors and detect the gully erosion susceptibility in the Lhasa River Basin. Seventy percent of the samples were used to train the model and rank the influencing factors by importance, and 30% were used to assess the prediction ability of the model. Approximately 15%-20% of the study area has a high or very high gully erosion susceptibility. The slopes of the lower Lhasa River and the Nyenchen Tanglha valleys were identified as areas with a high gully erosion susceptibility. The RF model exhibits the best performance, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.969 and 0.894 for the training and testing datasets, respectively. The main factors affecting the occurrence of gully erosion were determined to be the elevation, normalized difference vegetation index, relief, human footprint, mean annual temperature, and distance to the residential area. Elevation has the greatest effect on gully erosion, which can be explained as elevation indirectly controls gully erosion by affecting human activities and rainfall. The findings of this study provide insights into the effects of human activities, climate and permafrost on soil erosion and can serve as a basis for regional land use planning and gully erosion prevention and control in the Tibetan Plateau.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2024	235								107695	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107695		NOV 2023											WOS:001120010700001

Labile litter represents the major source for soil microbial products, which promote soil aggregation and long-term carbon (C) stabilization. The present study investigated the changes in carbohydrate monosaccharides and their origins (i.e., microbial-derived or plant derived carbohydrates) following the afforestation of cropland in the Loess Plateau region by Robinia pseudoacacia. Carbohydrate monosaccharides were determined in the soil fractions and plant organs in cropland and four R. pseudoacacia forests aged 5, 12, 25, and 32 years. The distributions of the soil aggregates and their stability were also measured. Forest expansion on cropland significantly increased the total organic C in the 0-10 cm soil layer by 31.8%. Glucose was the dominant monosaccharide in the plants and all soil fractions from all R. pseudoacacia forests, followed by galactose, xylose, and mannose. Following 32 years of afforestation, the ratios of microbial-derived carbohydrates relative to plant-derived carbohydrates (such as R(Rhamnose + Fucose)/ ((Arabinose + Xylose))) significantly increased by 131%, 149%, and 86% in the particulate organic matter, stable aggregate, and silt and clay fractions, respectively. Significant and positive correlations were found between the aggregate stability indexes and microbial-derived monosaccharides, thereby indicating that microbial-derived monosaccharides may play key roles in the stabilization of soil aggregates. These results suggest that following forest expansion on cropland, the increasing amounts of microbially-derived compounds corresponding to the increased allocation of soil C to stable aggregates may promote soil aggregation.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				APR	2022	211								106019	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106019		JAN 2022											WOS:000790443800003

Here, we aimed to systematically and comprehensively evaluate soil enzyme activity, SOC stability, and the associated driving factors in different vegetation zones after cropland abandonment on the Loess Plateau, China. We selected grasslands with different recovery times along a rainfall gradient encompassing the steppe zone (SZ), forest-steppe zone (FSZ), and forest zone (FZ). We measured and compared the changes in soil enzyme activity (saccharase, polyphenol oxidase, urease, phosphatase, and catalase) and SOC stability as a function of recovery time; we also evaluated the relationships between these two parameters. In SZ and FSZ, soil enzyme activity, fractions of oxidizable carbon (including very labile [C1], labile [C2], and less labile [C3]), and the carbon management index (CMI) increased with recovery time, whereas the SOC stability index (SI) decreased. Conversely, in FZ, polyphenol oxidase activity increased linearly, urease and catalase activities decreased linearly, and the change in saccharase activity was represented by a cubic equation regression. SI showed no obvious changes with recovery time, whereas C1, C2, and C3 initially decreased and then increased. Redundancy analysis showed that, in FSZ and FZ, soil enzyme activity, C1, C2, C3, and SI were influenced by vegetation diversity, coverage, and soil nutrient levels. In comparison, in SZ, these parameters were mainly influenced by soil nutrient levels. Soil enzyme activity was strongly correlated with C1 and C3 in SZ and FSZ, but not in FZ. Overall, in SZ and FSZ, soil enzyme activity increased with recovery time, whereas SOC stability decreased. In contrast, both parameters were relatively stable in FZ, which had higher mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature.						xue, sha/0000-0002-4452-8726; Xu, Hongwei/0000-0002-3628-3378													0341-8162	1872-6887				JAN	2021	196								104812	10.1016/j.catena.2020.104812	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.104812													WOS:000583955200003

The default vegetation parameters from Global Land Cover 2000, currently incorporated into global climate models and used in regional climate model RegCM, are not realistic for China, which may have contributed to serious bias in surface climate simulation. In this study, a new set of vegetation parameters considering the Plant Functional Type (PFT) fractions and the corresponding monthly leaf area index (PFT_LAI), were developed based on the land cover and MODIS LAI data sets. The regional climate model RegCM4.5 coupled with the land surface model CLM4.5 were utilized to test the performance of the new vegetation parameters by comparing simulations with observations using different surface parameters. The surface energy balance was analysed to examine the effects of changed vegetation parameters on regional climate. The results showed that the new parameters were more accurate than the GLC2000 parameters when describing the distribution of crops, grassland, and forests over China. The improved vegetation parameters reduced model biases for winter air temperature and precipitation over southern China by 0.9 degrees C and 8%, respectively, and reduced the winter temperature and summer precipitation biases over northeastern China by approximately 0.7 degrees C and 8%, respectively. More accurate surface albedo are the main reasons for reductions in model bias. However, certain biases, such as the cold and dry bias over the Tibetan Plateau, still remained in the simulation results using our new vegetation data.

In one spatial dimension, these states are organized in a foliated snaking structure owing to peak-peak repulsion but are shown to be all linearly unstable, with the number of unstable modes increasing with the number of peaks present. Despite this, in two spatial dimensions, direct numerical simulations reveal the presence of stable single- and multi-spot states whose properties depend on the repulsion from nearby spots as well as the shape of the domain and the boundary conditions imposed thereon. Front propagation is shown to trigger the growth of new spots while destabilizing others. The results indicate that multi-variable models may support new types of behavior that are absent from typical two-variable models. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

This study quantified the distribution and variation of soil water storage in a Pinus sylvestris (P. sylvestris) plantation under various stand ages (20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 years) along 0-1000 cm soil profile in the Mu Us sandy lands (North China). Results indicated that the 20-yr forests mainly consumed the soil water of the 0-200 cm depth soil profile, the 30-yr and 40-yr forests mainly consumed the soil water of the depth of 0-400 cm, whereas the oldest (50-60-yr) pines mainly consumed the soil water located at the deepest soil profile (500-700 cm). Variation of soil water storage (oSWS) was decreased with stand ages, reaching the minimum value in the 30-40-yr stands, and then gradually increased in the 50-60-yr stands. The oSWS was relatively uniform on the 50-yr and 60-yr stands. this pattern was associated with soil desiccation and soil-water depletion. The lower oSWS indicated lower soil water storage which was associated with soil desiccation and soil-water depletion. These findings proved that planted forest gradually aggravated soil water consumption along the increasing forest age, caused a serious soil water deficit in the 200-700 cm depth soil layer, which may be exceeding the water environmental carrying capacity. Therefore, we suggest that forest should be thinned on the periods with the highest oSWS, which would maintain long-term forest sustainability by minimizing soil desiccation for planted forest management in semi-arid sandy lands.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the fermentation quality, chemical composition, and in vitro rumen digestion characteristics of silages produced with mixtures of sweet sorghum (SS) and korshinsk pea shrub (KP) in six different ratios of fresh weights: 100:0 (0%KP), 80:20 (20%KP), 60:40 (40%KP), 40:60 (60%KP), 20:80 (80%KP), and 0:100 (100%KP). As the proportion of KP increased in the silages, the contents of lactic acid, acetic acid, starch, total phenolics, hydrolysable tannins, and condensed tannins decreased (p < 0.05), while the pH value and the contents of neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, ether extract, crude protein, and ash increased (p < 0.05). The silages were evaluated in 48 h incubations with rumen liquor. The in vitro dry matter digestibility, in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility, and in vitro gas production decreased as the proportion of KP increased (p < 0.05). This study suggests that ensiling SS-KP at a ratio of 80:20 is a practical method for preserving such low-DM forages (SS) and that these silage mixtures offer an opportunity to optimize the nutrient supply for ruminant production.																			1344-3941	1740-0929				JAN	2022	93	1							e13700	10.1111/asj.13700	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.13700								35355360					WOS:000775334800001

To date, most studies testing the MCH have been interspecific and results have been equivocal. We tested the MCH intraspecifically on Cerastes vipera, a species with a relatively short tail and suitable for testing the MCH. The relative tail length and length of the hemipenes pocket in Cerastes vipera were measured in preserved museum-maintained males (n = 35) and in free-ranging males and females (n = 277). Males exhibited relatively longer tails than females, which was explained fully by the length of the hemipenes pocket. The relatively short tail of C. vipera presents a constraint to the reproductive structures in males, as the length of the hemipenes pocket occupies a greater proportion in shorter- than longer-tailed individuals. This is the first report presenting these intraspecific findings in support of the MCH. Whether these relations are widespread among snake families, within Viperidae, or specifically within C. vipera warrants further studies.																			2045-2322					MAR 17	2023	13	1							4447	10.1038/s41598-023-31624-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31624-6								36932218					WOS:000955841200014

PE patterns are influenced by microorganisms utilising various substrates. However, the varied functional traits of keystone taxa and structure traits of the bacterial community associated with the PEs patterns remain elusive. Therefore, we established a microcosm by adding C4 maize residue (C4 plants have a different 13C signature than C3 plants) to C3 soil amended for 120 d to observe the dynamics of PEs. High-throughput sequencing techniques were used to detect the succession of bacteria; keystone taxa were identified using network analysis. Negative PE (early stage) and positive PE (late stage) were observed during residue decomposition. At the end of the incubation, residue with N resulted in a positive PE, while residue alone had a minimal effect on the decomposition of native SOC. Furthermore, the bacterial community structure displayed distinct successions during residue decomposition. Correspondingly, network analysis revealed differences in the keystone taxa between the early and late stages. Bacillus, Streptomyces, Arthrobacter, and Agromyces were the keystone taxa during the early stage, whereas BD2-11 terrestrial, Bacteroidales, Sphingomonadaceae, and Xanthomonadales were the keystone taxa at the late stage. These putative keystone taxa have different functional traits as drivers of community function, thus linking them to either negative or positive PE. In addition, network modules of bacterial communities differed in the early versus late stages and showed different module-trait relationships during PE. Therefore, the different modules are aggregated in response to distinct PE patterns. This study provides deeper insights into the network structure of bacterial community corresponding to PE patterns and highlights the importance of keystone taxa in PE.

Nitrogen fertilization significantly affects soil and straw quality, which may significantly affect straw decomposition; however, comprehensive studies considering both factors are lacking. To evaluate the decomposability of crop residues under nitrogen fertilization, we conducted three subexperiments involving straw decomposition in situ, decomposition of the same straw in soils with different nitrogen fertilization regimes and decomposition of different straw types in the same soil with nitrogen fertilization and investigated the changes in soil respiration and wheat straw physicochemical properties. Nitrogen fertilization promoted straw decomposition: 180 and 360 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) increased the weight loss rate by 9.95% and 11.15%, respectively, but the difference between the two was not significant. The carbon emissions under 360 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) were significantly higher than those under 180 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Straw chemical characteristics exhibited different sensitivities to nitrogen fertilization; hemicellulose responded positively to 180 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), while carbon and cellulose had obvious responses to only 360 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). The soil temperature, soil moisture, straw nitrogen content, and straw C/N ratio were the main factors affecting decomposition. Excessive nitrogen fails to promote nutrient return during straw decomposition and may also increase carbon emissions from farmland soil and aggravate the greenhouse effect. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding nutrient cycling in farmland ecosystems under reasonable fertilization regimes and for improving farmland soil quality and nitrogen fertilization.					贾, 晓宇/AHB-0724-2022; Yan, Weiming/CAG-9069-2022	贾, 晓宇/0000-0001-6011-1472; Yan, Weiming/0000-0001-5509-0806; Liu, Jin/0000-0002-1467-6445													0718-9508	0718-9516				DEC	2021	21	4					3110	3121		10.1007/s42729-021-00592-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42729-021-00592-z		AUG 2021											WOS:000691653900002

Combining slope engineering measures for revegetation is considered an effective eco-rehabilitation practice used to restore degraded slopes. However, a single slope measure is insufficient to efficiently utilize runoff and sediments to improve soil water, nitrogen, and organic matter for revegetation. In this study, four treatments were implemented on a hilly slope in a temperate continental semiarid area slope engineered with fish-scale pits (semicircle-shaped pit, 1.0 m in diameter, 0.5 m in radius, and 0.2 m deep), namely: with gravel mulching (GM), straw mulching (SM), infiltration hole (IH), and without other measures (CK). The effects of the combined measures on soil water, nitrogen, and organic matter contents were analyzed over 4 years. The results showed that the soil water storage (0-100 cm) showed no significant differences among all treatments; however, the soil (100-260 cm) of GM/SM/IH treatment increased by 11.65%/8.62%/7.10% compared with CK (p < 0.05). The soil organic matter and nitrogen (0-100 cm) under IH were 73.34%/81.29%/98.32% and 77.37%/80.27%/85.31% higher than CK/SM/GM, respectively (p < 0.05). Overall, IH is the most effective measure for increasing nitrogen and organic matter, and it is equally effective with GM and SM to increase the water replenishment of deep soils in semiarid areas. Our findings provide the combined measures to combat soil water, nitrogen, and organic matter deficits for slope revegetation in arid and semiarid areas.

Mapping gully features from remote sensing imagery is crucial for assisting in understanding gully erosion mechanisms, predicting its development processes and assessing its environmental and socio-economic effects over large areas, especially under the increasing global climate extremes and intensive human activities. However, the potential of using increasingly available high-resolution remote sensing imagery to detect and delineate gullies has been less evaluated. Hence, 130 gullies occurred along a transect were selected from a typical watershed in the hilly and gully region of the Chinese Loess Plateau, and visually interpreted from a Pleiades-1B satellite image (panchromatic-sharpened image at 0.5 m resolution fused with 2.0 m multi-spectral bands). The interpreted gullies were compared with their measured data obtained in the field using a differential global positioning system (GPS). Results showed that gullies could generally be accurately interpreted from the image, with an average relative error of gully area and gully perimeter being 11.1% and 8.9%, respectively, and 74.2% and 82.3% of the relative errors for gully area and gully perimeter were within 15%. But involving field measurements of gullies in present imagery-based gully studies is still recommended. To judge whether gullies were mapped accurately further, a standard adopting one-pixel tolerance along the mapped gully edges was proposed and proved to be practical. Correlation analysis indicated that larger gullies could be interpreted more accurately but increasing gully shape complexity would decrease interpreting accuracy. Overall lower vegetation coverage in winter due to the withering and falling of vegetation rarely affected gully interpreting. Furthermore, gully detectability on remote sensing imagery in this region was lower than the other places of the world, due to the overall broken topography in the Loess Plateau, thus images with higher resolution than normally perceived are needed when mapping erosion features here. Taking these influencing factors (gully dimension and shape complexity, vegetation coverage, topography) into account will be favorable to select appropriate imagery and gullies (as study objects) in future imagery-based gully studies. Finally, two linear regression models were built to correct gully area (A(ip), m(2)) and gully perimeter (P-ip, m) visually extracted, by connecting them with the measured area (A(ms), m(2)) and perimeter (P-ms, m). The correction models were <mml:semantics>Ams=1.021Aip+0.139</mml:semantics> and <mml:semantics>Pms=0.949Pip+0.722</mml:semantics>, respectively. These models could be helpful for improving the accuracy of interpreting results, and further accurately estimating gully development and developing more effective automated gully extraction methods on the Loess Plateau of China.

Applying soil amendments is a practical strategy in agricultural production to improve soil environment. Weathered coal (WC) is an organic amendment that can be used to improve soil quality. However, the effects of WC application on soil organic carbon pool stability, and its differences from the effects of biochar (BC, a common amendment) application remains unclear. In this study, BC was selected as a comparison to further evaluate the potential of WC based on a 3-year field experiment, in which WC and BC were individually applied into a loamy clay soil at 0%, 1%, and 3% (w/w) rates. Soil organic carbon and its fractions (including particulate organic carbon and mineral-bound organic carbon), soil aggregate fractions and its stability, and the organic carbon content in aggregates were examined. The results showed that both WC and BC significantly increased soil total organic carbon, particulate and mineral-bound organic carbon (P < 0.05). The mineral-bound organic carbon content in WC treatment was significantly higher than that in BC treatment (by 32% under the 3% rate) (P < 0.05), whereas, there were no significant differences in soil total organic carbon content. Both WC and BC increased the soil organic carbon content in all aggregate fractions. While only the WC improved the soil aggregate stability, and which was 15% (under 1% rate) and 28% (under 3% rate) higher in WC treatments than in BC treatments (P < 0.05). The proportion of mineral-bound organic carbon to soil total organic carbon content and the soil aggregate stability were obviously related the soil C/N, and the WC treatments had a higher proportion of mineral-bound organic carbon and soil aggregate stability than BC treatments under the same soil C/ N. The results indicated that the application of WC may be more effective than BC in increasing mineral and aggregate protection for soil organic carbon and thus improving soil carbon pool stability. Additionally, the purchase cost of WC was clearly lower than that of BC. Combined with the low cost and the benefits in soil structure and carbon pool stability, the application of WC appeared to have advantages over BC. Our findings provide robust evidence that WC is more effective than BC in improving soil carbon pool stability.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				OCT	2023	438								116639	10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116639	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116639		AUG 2023											WOS:001064418300001

In this study, dynamics in the abundance and structure of metabolically active Anaeromyxobacter community based on RNA level were investigated by a 40-d anaerobic incubation of paddy soils amended with glucose at 0.1 and 0.5 mol C kg(-1) soil, respectively. Compared with the control treatment, glucose additions generally showed obvious inhibitory effect on the Anaeromyxobacter growth; glucose addition at low concentration decreased the abundance of Anaeromyxobacter by 3.56 x 10(6) to 4.06 x 10(7) copies g(-1) soil within the first 5 d of incubation, whereas a remarkable decrease by 4.54 x 10(6) to 7.71 x 10(7) copies g(-1) soil occurred after paddy soils were amended with high glucose concentration. Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans-like OTU_1 (where OTU stands for operational taxonomic unit) was dominant in the metabolically active Anaeromyxobacter community and showed significant and positive relationship with Fe(III) reduction process. The structure of Anaeromyxobacter community was greatly altered by glucose additions, and divergences mainly occurred after 5 d of incubation. Additionally, glucose additions could enhance interactions within the Anaeromyxobacter community, especially for positive correlations. In general, glucose addition could greatly inhibit the abundance and alter the structure of Anaeromyxobacter community by jointly decreasing soil pH; however, it could promote the final Fe(III) reduction by enhancing the utilization of Anaeromyxobacter to crystalline Fe oxide.

This study investigated the abundance of MPs in facility, farmland, grassland, and orchard soils in the Qaidam basin and Hehuang valley of Qinghai Province and analyzed its shape, size, color, and polymer composition distribution characteristics from 105 sites. The average abundance of MPs in facility, farmland, and grassland soils in the Hehuang valley were 2795.7, 1860.5, and 910.9 items kg-1, which were 1.33, 4.84, and 1.50 times higher than those in the Qaidam basin, respectively. Orchard soils had 1322.2 items kgxfffd; 1 MPs. Soil MPs abundance in grassland and farmland was positively correlated with precipitation and 0 cm ground temperature; and negatively correlated with average wind speed (p < 0.05). Both the particle size of < 1 mm and pellet-shape MPs abundance showed a positive correlation with SOC (p < 0.05). Land-use patterns had the most significant affecting force (51.35%) on soil MPs abundance (p < 0.0001). Hence, land-use patterns, regional climate, and soil properties influence the distribution characteristics of soil MPs; besides, the land-use patterns were dominant.					haohao, li/HLG-9330-2023														0304-3894	1873-3336				MAR 15	2022	426								127806	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127806	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127806		JAN 2022						34802828					WOS:000752501900001

Here, by evaluating the effectiveness of the two-tier model, this study focused on the socioeconomic and environmental co-benefits of the solar PV industry in sandy ecosystems. The results showed that the ecosystem services provided by the combined system land were 24 times higher than those provide by natural recovering land. The combined system could achieve $5258.86 x 10(4) in benefits per year, including $3897.48 x 10(4) from electricity and $1361.38 x 10(4) from ecosystem services value. The ecosystem services value could reach 34.93% of the electricity benefits value and become a vital part of the total valuation. The results indicated that electricity benefits and considerable ecosystem value could be generated from the combined systems. These combined systems have great potential for combating desertification and should be considered appropriate public investment projects with high economic and social rates of return in arid areas.

However, the underlying species-specific nutrient use strategy and stoichiometric homeostasis in driving community structure and stability changes remain unclear. A split-plot N and P addition experiment (main-plot: 0, 25, 50, and 100 kgN hm(-2) a(-1); subplot: 0, 20, 40, and 80 kgP(2)O(5) hm(-2) a(-1)) was conducted during 2017-2019 in two typical grasslands (perennial grass and perennial forb) communities in the Loess Plateau. The stoichiometric homeostasis of 10 main component species, species dominance, stability changes, and their contribution to community stability were investigated. Perennial legume and perennial clonal species tend to perform higher stoichiometric homeostasis than non-clonal and annual forb. Large shifts in species with high homeostasis vs. low homeostasis caused by N and P addition showed consistently profound impacts on community homeostasis and stability in both communities. In both two communities, species dominance performed significantly positive relationships with homeostasis under no N and P addition. P alone or combined with 25 kgN hm(-2) a(-1) addition strengthened species dominance-homeostasis relationship and increased community homeostasis due to increased perennial legumes. Under 50 and 100 kgN hm(-2) a(-1) combined with P addition, species dominance-homeostasis relationships were weakened, and community homeostasis decreased significantly in both communities, which was due to that increased annual and non-clonal forb suppressed perennial legume and clonal species. Our results demonstrated that trait-based classifications of species-level homeostasis offer a reliable tool in predicting species performance and community stability under N and P addition, and conserving species with high homeostasis is important to enhance semiarid grassland ecosystem function stability on the Loess Plateau.					zhang, xinyu/JKI-8403-2023; Wang, Han/JJF-2614-2023; Yang, Lili/JTT-5215-2023; Zhang, Wei/JKI-3565-2023; Zhang, Yuting/JRW-3937-2023	Yang, Lili/0009-0008-2926-484X; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2023	30	22			SI		61913	61926		10.1007/s11356-023-26479-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-26479-3		MAR 2023						36933129					WOS:000954375300003

These bedforms have no terrestrial counterpart and several hypotheses for origins have been proposed. This work reports results of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) experiments with ANSYS Fluent under terrestrial and Martian boundary layer conditions, using the k - omega SST turbulence model to evaluate shear stress along a topographic profile of large Martian ripples at different boundary layer wind speeds. Results indicate that, compared with Earth conditions: (1) boundary-layer flow along large ripples under Martian conditions is less turbulent due to higher kinematic viscosity; (2) reverse-flow vortex regions from crests at ripple lee flanks are larger; and (3) shear stresses at crests of large ripples are relatively low, so ripple flattening is less likely at high wind speeds. These results indicate Martian ripples formed by the saltation impact splash mechanism should be less constrained by shear stress effects limiting growth of exposed ripple crests, because the low-density Martian atmosphere applies relatively low wind-related shear stress to ripple surfaces. Other origins for the large Martian ripples are not excluded, however. On Earth, very large ripples with crests unprotected by very coarse grains do not develop due to higher wind-related shear stresses.

While previous studies have found the restoration age to be a major factor controlling SOC change, potential effects of vegetation type and plant species have been largely neglected. Here, we compiled a database of 331 measurements of SOC changes following cropland restoration across the entire Loess Plateau. Results from stepwise multiple linear regressions indicated dominant contributions by restoration age, vegetation type or plant species, and/or their interactions in post-restoration SOC accumulation, accounting for 67-86% of the variation in SOC sequestration being explained by the model. Of the four restoration types examined, managed grassland was found to have the highest SOC sequestration rate (0.41 Mg C hm(-2) yr(-1)), followed by plantation (0.27 Mg C hm(-2) yr(-1)) and shrubland (0.25 Mg C hm(-2) yr(-1)), with the lowest value found for naturally recovered grassland (0.13 Mg C hm(-2) yr(-1)). The different SOC sequestration capacities for these vegetation types were further confirmed by an independent mechanistic modeling approach based on SOC turnover rate. Our results highlight the critical role of plant type in determining SOC sequestration following revegetation over cropland. Such management-relevant information should be considered in future restoration efforts.

However, the variation in the hydraulic characteristics of the headcut erosion process is still not clear in the gully region of the Loess Plateau. A series of rainfall combined scouring experiments (flow discharges ranging from 3.6 to 7.2 m(3) hr(-1), with 0.8 mm min(-1) rainfall intensity) were conducted on experimental plots to clarify the variation in the hydraulic parameters induced by gully head and erosion processes under different flow discharges. The results showed that concentrated flows in the catchment area and gully bed were turbulent (Reynolds number ranging from 1,876 to 6,693) and transformed between supercritical and subcritical (Froude number ranging from 0.96 to 3.73). The hydraulic parameters, such as the flow velocity, Reynolds number, shear stress, stream power, Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, and unit stream power in the catchment area were 0.45-0.59 m s(-1), 2086-6693, 1.96-5.33 Pa, 0.89-2.86 W m(-2), 0.08-0.16, and 0.023-0.031 m s(-1), respectively. When the concentrated flows dropped from the gully head, the hydraulic parameters in the gully bed decreased by 3.39-26.07%, 1.49-29.99%, 65.19-67.14%, 67.25-74.96%, 28.53-61.31%, and 67.82-77.14%, respectively, which contributed to the flow energy consumption at the gully head. As flow discharge increased, Reynolds number, shear stress, and stream power increased, while flow velocity, Froude number, unit stream power, and Darcy-Weisbach friction factor did not. The flow energy consumption at the gully head was 9.66-10.13, 13.25-13.74, 15.68-16.41, and 19.28-20.25 J s(-1), respectively, under different flow discharges and accounted for 60.58-68.50% of the flow energy consumption of the experimental plots. Generally, the sediment discharges increased rapidly at the initial stage, then increased slowly, and finally reached a steady state condition, which showed a significant declining logarithmic trend with experimental duration (P<.01) and increased with increasing flow discharge. Accordingly, the flow energy consumption was significantly correlated with the sediment yield. These findings could improve our understanding of the hydraulic properties and flow energy characteristics of headcut erosion.

J	Zhao, W; Zhang, R; Cao, H; Tan, WF				Zhao, Wei; Zhang, Rui; Cao, Hua; Tan, Wenfeng			Factor contribution to soil organic and inorganic carbon accumulation in the Loess Plateau: Structural equation modeling	GEODERMA												The effects of climate, soil characteristics and management on soil carbon accumulation have been extensively investigated. However, the relative importance of these factors remains unclear, especially in arid and semiarid regions. Here we evaluated the contribution of the environmental variables (geographical location, climate, soil type, and land use type) to soil organic and inorganic carbon accumulation in the 0-100 cm soil layers across the Loess Plateau in China. A structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to distinguish direct from indirect effects of factors on soil carbon accumulation based on covariance structures. The results showed that environmental temperature and moisture were the primary controls of soil organic carbon density (SOCD) variation. The total effects (the sum of direct and indirect effect) of soil type and land use on SOCD were less than half of those of environmental temperature and moisture. In addition, the direct and negative effect of environmental temperature on SOCD increased, and the direct and positive effect of environmental moisture on SOCD decreased with soil depth. For the soil inorganic carbon densities in the 0-100 cm soil layers, soil organic carbon (SOC) content acted as the most important factor controlling the variations in soil inorganic carbon density (SICD). Environmental temperature and moisture mainly affected indirectly SICD by mediating through its impacts on soil type, SOC content, or soil pH. Less than 40% of variation in soil carbon accumulation for 0-100 cm soil depth is explained in the model. The unexplained variance highlights the need for the data on soil physicochemical properties, quality of organic carbon inputs, and soil microorganisms.					zhao, wei/X-9123-2019; Tan, Wenfeng F./G-5736-2011	zhao, wei/0000-0002-6035-1836; 													0016-7061	1872-6259				OCT 15	2019	352						116	125		10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.06.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.06.005													WOS:000485207300012

Most of limited preceding works on analysis of climate change induced salinization of the river ecosystems have employed simplistic empirical models. Accordingly, this paper deals with developing a conceptual module for primary salinity modelling in framework of a physically-based hydrological model, i.e. Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), for analyzing climate change impacts on catchment-scale primary hydro-salinity. The developed methodology is applied to saline Shour River located south of Iran, which recently has been facing water shortage and restriction due to the river's salinity. The model is validated according to historical records of the river's discharge and salinity using Sequential Uncertainty FItting ver. 2 (SUFI2) algorithm, where acceptable Nash-Sutcliff values of 0.73 (0.76) and 0.56 (0.65) is respectively achieved for discharge and total dissolved solids (TDS) in calibration (validation) period. The calibrated model is then utilized for climate change scenarios analysis where climate time series projected under conditions of A2, B1 and A1B scenarios are introduced to the model. The results indicates how time series of river salinity increases for both near future, years 2046-2064, and far future, years 2081-2099, with respect to current condition.

We studied the 30 yr effect of crop rotations on soil N fractions at 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths in the Loess Plateau of China. Crop rotations were continuous winter wheat (Triticurn aestivwn L.) (W), corn (Zea mays L.)-winter wheat-winter wheat-millet (Eleusine coracana L.) (CWWM), pea (Piswn sativwn L.)-winter wheat-winter wheat-millet (PWWM), and sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.)-winter wheat-winter wheat-sainfoin (SWWS); pea-winter wheat-winter wheat-corn (PWWC); alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (4 yr)-potato (solanwn tuberoswn L.) (1 yr)-winter wheat (3 yr) (A4PoW3), and fallow (F). Nitrogen fractions were soil total N (STN), particulate organic N (PON), microbial biomass N (MBN), potential N mineralization (PNM), NH4-N, and NO3-N. The STN and PON at 0-15 cm were greater in CWWM and at 15-30 cm were greater in A4PoW3 than F and W. The PNM at both depths was greater in A4PoW3 than other crop rotations, except SWWS and CWWM. The MBN was greater in CWWM, PWWM, SWWS, and A4PoW3 than other crop rotations. The NH4-N content was greater in F than other crop rotations, except PWWC. The NO3-N content at 0-15 cm was greater in CWWM and at 15-30 cm was greater in PWWM than F. Most soil N fractions were correlated with each other and also with the length of the crop rotation. Diversified crop rotations with increased root biomass N returned to the soil and longer year rotations enhanced soil N storage, mineralization, and availability compared with monocropping and fallow.

Objective: To determine the factors associated with anemia among pregnant women attending antenatal care in Jigjiga public health facilities, Somali Region, East Ethiopia. Methods: An institution-based unmatched case-control study was conducted. The sample size was 228 pregnant women; comprising 114 presenting with anemia and 114 controls. Hemoglobin levels were measured using a portable heme analyzer. Socio-demographic, dietary, medical history, and nutrition-related data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Data were entered into Epidata 3.1 and exported to Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 for cleaning and analyses. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed and statistical significance was considered at a level of p<0.05. Results: Three predictors of anemia among pregnant women were identified in this study. An inadequate intake of red meat (i.e. those who consumed red meat 1-2 times a month [AOR=7.245; 95% CI=(2.007-26.151)] or not at all [AOR=8.690; 95% CI=(1.795-42.072)]), and insufficient consumption of green vegetables (i.e. 1-2 times a week [AOR=2.970; 95% CI= (1.012-8.716)] or 1-2 times a month [AOR=8.057; 95% CI=(2.358-27.526)]) were associated with anemia. Also, having a mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of less than 23 cm was strongly associated [AOR=16.432; 95% CI= (5.240-51.526)] with anemia. Conclusion: This study revealed three key factors to be associated with anemia among pregnant women in Jigjiga Town, namely reduced intake of red meat and green vegetables, and low MUAC. Interventions including nutrition counselling and enrolling pregnant women with low nutritional status in nutritional programs should be the core components of anemia control strategies, needed to address the high prevalence of anemia during pregnancy in developing countries.

The results showed that the ILAC-N comprises a double-channeled structure with micro and mesopores. It exhibits an excellent adsorption capacity of TC across a wide pH range (pH 2-11), with the highest adsorption capacity of 1396 mg g(-1) at 323 K. Tests in actual wastewater showed that the TC removal rate by ILAC-N exceeded 97.4%. Moreover, it maintained a removal rate of 84% after 10 regeneration cycles, revealing its high reusability. Mechanisms suggested that pore filling and pi-pi interaction played a critical role in this process. In conclusion, ILAC-N can be broadly applied to livestock manure and pharmaceutical wastewater treatment, owing to its high adsorption capacity, good adsorption properties across a wide pH range, excellent reusability. Furthermore, this research opens a new path for lignin utilization.																			0960-8524	1873-2976				FEB	2022	346								126652	10.1016/j.biortech.2021.126652	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.126652		JAN 2022						34979279					WOS:000743582500010
J	Zhang, ZD; Huang, MB				Zhang, Zhongdian; Huang, Mingbin			Effect of root-zone vertical soil moisture heterogeneity on water transport safety in soil-plant-atmosphere continuum in <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Soil moisture in root zone is highly heterogeneous in space, while its effect on water transport safety in soil-plant atmosphere continuum (SPAC) remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted vertical spilt-root experiments in R. pseudoacacia using loamy clay and sandy loam soils in greenhouse, and measured the dynamics of midday transpiration rate, predawn and midday leaf water potential with the lower root zone remaining drought and the upper root zone undergoing the drought-rewatered-drought process. The plant supply-demand hydraulic model was calibrated with the measured data, indicating that the model could efficiently simulate SPAC water transport in R. pseudoacacia under the condition of vertical soil moisture heterogeneity. On this basis, we set various combinations of soil moisture in the upper and lower root zones under different soil types and atmospheric evaporative demands in the model, and simulated the variations of indicators describing water transport safety in SPAC, including actual transpiration rate (E), the critical leaf transpiration rate at hydraulic failure (E-crit), hydraulic safety margin (HSM), and percentage loss of soil-plant hydraulic conductance (PLK). The numerical simulations suggested that the water transport safety in SPAC varied substantially with vertical soil moisture heterogeneity, and the responses were impacted by soil types and atmospheric evaporative demand. With decreasing soil moisture in the upper root zone (SMCup), E-crit, E and HSM remained steady at first and then decreased rapidly when SMCup below a threshold, while PLK exhibited an opposite trend. With decreasing soil moisture in the lower root-zone (SMCdown), the curves of E-crit, E and HSM presented a descending trend, while the curve of PLK went up. Water transport safety in SPAC declined with decreasing SWCup and SWCdown and became more sensitive to SWCup with a lower SWCdown. SWCdown had greater impact on water transport safety in SPAC under coarser-textured soil with higher atmospheric evaporative demand. The results were supplemental to the traditional analysis of soil water availability to plants under homogeneous condition, and would be helpful for analyzing functional difference of water storage in different soil depths as well as for optimizing water resource management.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				MAR 1	2021	246								106702	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106702													WOS:000611820100003

However, the responses of leaf water potential and gas exchange of shrubs in semi-arid areas to the precipitation alteration are not clear. Here, we conducted a manipulated experiment with three levels of precipitation, i.e., a control with ambient precipitation, 50% above ambient precipitation (irrigation treatment), and 50% below ambient precipitation (drought treatment), with two common shrubs, Salix psammophila C. Wang & C. Y. Yang (isohydric plant, maintaining a constant leaf water potential by stomatal regulation) and Caragana korshinskii Kom. (anisohydric plant, having more variable leaf water potential), on the Chinese Loess Plateau in 2014 and 2015. We measured the seasonal variations of predawn and midday leaf water potential (omega(pd) and omega(md)), two parameters of gas exchange, i.e., light-saturated assimilation (A(n)) and stomatal conductance (g(s)), and other foliar and canopy traits. The isohydric S. psammophila had a similar A(n) and a higher g(s) than the anisohydric C. korshinskii under drought treatment in 2015, inconsistent with the view that photosynthetic capacity of anisohydric plants is higher than isohydric plants under severe drought. The two shrubs differently responded to precipitation manipulation. omega(pd), A(n) and g(s) were higher under irrigation treatment than control for S. psammophila, and these three variables and omega(md) were significantly higher under irrigation treatment and lower under drought treatment than control for C. korshinskii. Leaf water potential and gas exchange responded to manipulated precipitation more strongly for C. korshinskii than for S. psammophila. However, precipitation manipulation did not alter the sensitivity of leaf gas exchange to vapor-pressure deficit and soil moisture in these two shrubs. Acclimation to long-term changes in soil moisture in these two shrubs was primarily attributed to the changes in leaf or canopy structure rather than leaf gas exchange. These findings will be useful for modeling canopy water-carbon exchange and elucidating the adaptive strategies of these two shrubs to future changes in precipitation.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				MAR	2020	12	2					267	282		10.1007/s40333-020-0008-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-020-0008-7		MAR 2020											WOS:000522574200001

In the past 20 years, effective vegetation restoration measures have significantly changed the near-surface characteristics of soil. In natural conditions, plant litter is widespread in the topsoil. The effects of litter incorporated into soil on the process of soil detachment, which is closely related to plant litter morphology, are still not well known. This study aimed to detect the variation of litter morphological characteristics and quantify their effects on soil detachment capacity and rill erodibility when litter is incorporated into the soil. Four plant litters (Bothriochloa ischaemum (L.) Keng., Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb., Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv., and Artemisia capillaris Thunb.) with five length levels (<0.5, 0.5-2, 2-4, 4-6, and 6-8 cm) were incorporated into soil (idle for 50 days) at the same litter biomass rate (0.7 kg m(2)). Then the soil was sampled and cores were subjected to overland flow under six flow shear stress levels (5.66, 8.31, 12.21, 15.55, 19.15 and, 22.11 Pa) using a hydraulic flume (4.0 m x 0.35 m). The results showed that the litter morphological characteristics of litter length density (LLD), litter surface area density (LSAD) and litter volume ratio (LVR) differed in plant species at the same litter biomass rate. Correspondingly, soil detachment capacity (ranging from 0.414 to 2.179 kg m(2) S-1) and rill erodibility (ranging from 0.037 to 0.177 s m(1)) varied significantly and mean values from the Bothriochloa ischaemum (L.) Keng. treatments were the minimums, which were 28% to 37% and 23% to 35% less than that of the other treatments, respectively. The soil detachment capacity and rill erodibility were significantly correlated with the litter morphological characteristics of LLD, LSAD and LVR (p < 0.01). The contact area between litter and soil was the most critical factor affecting soil detachment. Incorporated plant litter residue litter effect on rill erodibility could be well estimated by LSAD.

Four years experiments were carried out on cotton from 2012 to 2015 seasons with four salinity levels in irrigation water, including 1.3 dS m(-1) (CK), 5.4 dS m(-1) (S1), 8.8 dS m(-1) (S2), and 12.4 dS m(-1) (S3) in lowland plain of Hebei in the North China Plain (NCP). Parameters of the FAO AquaCrop model were calibrated with a dataset collected in the 2012 season, and the model was validated with independent data from the next three seasons. Under the condition of saline water irrigation, the simulation of canopy cover, soil water content, soil electric conductivity, biomass, and yield was accurate (the coefficient of determination (R-2) > 0.65, the index of agreement (d) > 0.89). The scenario simulations with different salinity levels in irrigation water were run in growing degree days mode in AquaCrop with climatic data from 1958 to 2010. In the high (483 mm) and normal (430 mm) rainfall years, salt was drained out of the soil profile. Whereas, salt was accumulated in the soil profile under the scenario of S2 and S3, while was leaving out the root zone in the scenario of CK and S1 in the low (324 mm) rainfall years. With the salinity of 4.5 dS m(-1), the difference between salt inside and outside of the soil profile tends to be zero. Based on the scenario simulations, the relationships between crop evapotranspiration (ETa) and cotton yield and between ETa and water productivity were fitted with a quadratic curve. It is concluded from the scenario simulations that there are real risks in soil salinization for cotton production in the lowland plain of Hebei in the NCP due to saline water irrigation.

J	Geng, QL; Ren, QF; Nolan, RH; Wu, PT; Yu, Q				Geng, Qingling; Ren, Qingfu; Nolan, Rachael H.; Wu, Pute; Yu, Qiang			Assessing China's agricultural water use efficiency in a green-blue water perspective: A study based on data envelopment analysis	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Uneven water resources and growing food demand due to an increasing population bring challenges to China. One important mechanism to address these challenges is to enhance water use efficiency (WUE). This requires information on current efficiencies in water use for agricultural production. In this study, we provide a benchmarking tool to assess relative agricultural WUE in 31 provinces in China during 2003-2013. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used with both green-blue water and blue-only scenarios. Results show that China's agricultural WUE has improved evidently after 2008. Overall technical efficiency (TE) and the pure technical efficiency (PTE) in China based on the green-blue scenario are relatively high, with the average potential increase less than 10% (8% and 4%, respectively). However, there is a larger potential for blue water use efficiency (14% and 7% respectively). The PTE in Northern China (NC) is higher than that in Southern China (SC) while the TE in NC is lower under green-blue scenario. Moreover, the TE and PTE in NC are lower than that in SC under blue-only scenario. These results indicate that green water management techniques in NC are superior to SC but the scale efficiency (SE) in NC is lower. There are four provinces where the efficiency values are on the frontier in four cases, i.e. two scenarios (green-blue and blue-only) and two assumptions in DEA, but fourteen provinces where the efficiency values are not on the frontier in any case and most of them were located in SC. Our results also suggest that improving SE can substantially contribute to national WUE, but exploring the solutions to enhance blue water use efficiency in China is also a key task in the future works. The research results have important implications for China and different provinces to improve agricultural WUE by water policies and management.

The scheme is located in Gumselasa catchment (28 km(2)), Tigray region, northern Ethiopia. The catchment is underlain by limestone-shale-marl intercalations with dolerite intrusion and some recent sediments. Water balance computation, hydrochemical analyses and irrigation water quality analyses methods were used in this investigation. Surface waters (river and reservoir) and groundwater samples were collected and analyzed. The water table in the irrigated land is ranging 0.2-2 m below the ground level. The majority of groundwater in the effective watershed area and the river and dam waters are fresh and alkaline whereas in the command area the groundwater is dominantly brackish and alkaline. The main hydrochemical facies in the groundwater in the effective watershed area are Ca-Na-SO4-HCO3, Ca-Na-HCO3-SO4, and Ca-Na-Mg-SO4-HCO3. The river and dam waters are Mg-Na-HCO3-SO4 and HCO3-SO4-Cl types, respectively. In the command area the main hydrochemical facies in the groundwater are Ca-Na-HCO3-SO4 and Ca-Na-Mg-SO4-HCO3. Irrigation water quality analyses revealed that salinity and toxicity hazards increase from the effective watershed to the irrigated land following the direction of the water flow. The results also showed that the analyzed waters for irrigation purpose had no sodicity hazard. The major composition controlling mechanisms in the groundwater chemistry was identified as the dissolution of carbonate minerals, silicate weathering, and cation exchange. One of the impacts of the construction of the dam in the hydrologic environment of the catchment is on its groundwater potential. The dam is indirectly recharging the aquifers and enhances the groundwater potential of the area. This increment of availability of groundwater enhanced dissolution of carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite, and gypsum), silicate weathering and cation exchange processes, which are the main causes of salinity in the irrigated land. The rising of the brackish groundwater combined with insufficient leaching contributed to secondary salinization development in the irrigated land. Installation of surface and subsurface drainage systems and planting salt tolerant (salt loving) plants are recommended to minimize the risk of salinization and salt accumulation in the soils of the irrigated land.

This study used laboratory experiments to examine the combined effects of the straw length and incorporation rate on reducing runoff and sediment, under straw incorporation. The experiments involved three wheat straw lengths (3-5, 8-10, and 13-15 cm) and four incorporation rates (1.5, 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 t.hm(-2)). Bare slopes were selected as the control, and the experimental soil was silty loam. Three hundred-cm-long, 100-cm-wide, and 50cm-deep soil tanks with 15 degrees slopes were subjected to artificial rainfall with a duration of 1 h and an intensity of 90 mm.h(-1). Straw incorporation reduced the runoff and sediment yields by 3.11-18.18% and 30.71-57.71%, respectively. When the straw length was combined with the incorporation rate, as the straw length increased, the sensitivity of the runoff and sediment yields to the incorporation rate decreased first and then increased. Similarly, the sensitivity to the straw length also decreased first and then increased, as the incorporation rate increased. In the combination mode, the greatest runoff and sediment reduction effects were achieved at a straw length of 8-10 cm and an incorporation rate of 3.5 t.hm(-2), which were the optimal straw length and incorporation rate values. The reduction effect of the straw length on the runoff and sediment yields was weaker than that of the incorporation rate. The incorporation rate was always the main factor affecting the runoff yield during the erosion process, while the main factor affecting the sediment yield changed gradually from the straw length to the incorporation rate. Thus, the incorporation rate is also a crucial factor inhibiting rill development. The effect of the straw length on sediment reduction primarily involves reducing hydrodynamic factors, such as flow velocity, while the incorporation rate plays a stronger role in reducing soil erodibility. This study provides a scientific basis for selecting and applying conservation tillage measures involving straw incorporation.

Such a relationship is predicted between inbreeding levels and dispersability, which may be anatomically and ontogenetically linked so that the selection pressures on one may affect the other. While both the effect of inbreeding on reproductive success and on dispersal strategies received much attention, only a few studies considered both simultaneously. Furthermore, such studies often rely on two dichotomic representations of breeding and dispersal: using selfing versus outcrossing as a representation of breeding level, and dispersal ratio as the sole representation of dispersal strategy. Methods Here, we used pollination experiments in the heterocarpic Crepis sancta (Asteraceae) to expand in two different manners on the common practice of using dichotomic representations of breeding and dispersal. First, we used pollination treatments that represent a continuum from selfing through pollination by kin to pollination by a distant neighbor. Second, we measured a whole set of continuous morphological and dispersal-related traits, in addition to measurements of reproductive success and dispersal ratio. Important Findings The proportion of developed capitula and the number of both dispersed and non-dispersed achenes were significantly lower in the self-pollination treatment in comparison to the outcrossed treatments. The effect of pollen sources on dispersal ratio was not statistically significant, though self-pollinated plants rarely produced non-dispersing seeds. Achene's biomass increased with distance between parent plants, but pappus width did not, leading to a nonsignificant effect of pollination on falling velocity. Overall, pollen source affected mainly traits that were associated with reproductive output, but it had no clear effect on predominately dispersal-related traits. Such differences in the response of reproduction and dispersal traits to variation in pollen source suggest that dispersal-related selection is probably weak and/or masked by other forces.

Assessment of adaptation practices for risk minimization to drought in semi-arid environments	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT												India is one of the most drought prone countries in the world and droughts are impacting agricultural production and livelihoods. Building resilience of agriculture has become important in view of the large-scale impacts of climate change and quantification of resilience is essential for objective assessment of technologies and systems for their performance. The focus of the study is to assess the impact of technologies in alleviating the impact of drought and to operationalize the concept of resilience to climatic stress. Two indices, resilience score, which indicates the performance of the technology during stress vis-a-vis the farmers' practice during normal rainfall year and resilience gain, which indicates the performance of technology over that of the farmers' practice during the stress year were used for assessing resilience. Location specific climate resilient technologies are adopted as a part of the ongoing project (National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA-since 2011)) and the extent of resilience achieved due to adoption of technologies is assessed with reference to drought occurred in 2016-2017 by collecting data from 113 households from two villages representing prevalent production systems of the villages vis-a-vis during the normal rainfall year (2015-16). Statistical significance of the impact of technologies adopted was ascertained using independent sample t-test and dummy variable regression technique. Drought has significant negative impact (p < 0.01) and decreased the production by 85% and income by 93%. Adoption of technologies resulted in yield and income gain (p < 0.01) during normal and drought years. Resilience score due to adoption of drought escaping cultivars ranged from 45 to 88% and 72 to 121% from livestock related technologies. Resilience gain due to climate smart technologies ranged from 15 to 118% over the farmers' practice. Adoption of multiple farm enterprises enhanced income during drought and resilience. There is a need to encourage and support adoption of promising technologies for enhancing resilience and to minimize drought risk.																			2212-0963						2023	42								100563	10.1016/j.crm.2023.100563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2023.100563		OCT 2023											WOS:001099884400001

Here, the effects of N (N0, N50, and N100, corresponding to 0, 50, and 100 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively) or/and P additions (P0, P40, and P80, corresponding to 0, 40, and 80 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) on photosynthetic characteristics and leaf economic traits of three dominant species (two grasses: Bothriochloa ischaemum and Stipa bungeana; a leguminous subshrub: Lespedeza davurica) were investigated in a semiarid grassland community on the Loess Plateau of China. Results showed that, after a three-year N addition, all three species had higher specific leaf area (SLA), leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD value), maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-Nmax), and leaf instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE), while also having a lower leaf dry matter content (LDMC). The two grasses, B. ischaemum and S. bungeana, showed greater increases in P-Nmax and SLA than the subshrub L. davurica. P addition alone had no noticeable effect on the P-Nmax of the two grasses while it significantly increased the P-Nmax of L. davurica. There was an evident synergetic effect of the addition of N and P combined on photosynthetic traits and most leaf economic traits in the three species. All species had relatively high P-Nmax and SLA under the addition of N50 combined with P40. Overall, this study suggests that N and P addition shifted leaf economic traits towards a greater light harvesting ability and, thus, elevated photosynthesis in the three dominant species of a semiarid grassland community, and this was achieved by species-specific responses in leaf functional traits. These results may provide insights into grassland restoration and the assessment of community development in the context of atmospheric N deposition and intensive agricultural fertilization.

Drought stress is one of the major environmental issues that affect plant growth and productivity. Although complex regulatory gene networks of plants under drought stress have been analyzed extensively, the response mechanism in the early stage of drought stress is still rarely mentioned. Here, we performed transcriptome analyses on cotton samples treated for a short time (10 min, 30 min, 60 min, 180 min) using 10% PEG, which is used to simulate drought stress. The analysis of differently expressed genes (DEGs) showed that the number of DEGs in roots was obviously more than that in stems and leaves at the four time points and maintained > 2000 FDEGs (DEGs appearing for the first time) from 10 min, indicating that root tissues of plants respond to drought stress quickly and continuously strongly. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that DEGs in roots were mainly enriched in protein modification and microtubule-based process. DEGs were found significantly enriched in phosphatidylinositol signaling system at 10 min through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, implying the great importance of phosphatidylinositol signal in the early stage of drought stress. What was more, two co-expression modules, which were significantly positively correlated with drought stress, were found by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). From one of the co-expression modules, we identified a hub-gene Gohir. A07G058200, which is annotated as "phosphatidylinositol 3-and 4-kinase " in phosphatidylinositol signaling system, and found this gene may interact with auxin-responsive protein. This result suggested that Gohir. A07G058200 may be involved in the crosstalk of phosphatidylinositol signal and auxin signal in the early stage of drought stress. In summary, through transcriptome sequencing, we found that phosphatidylinositol signaling system is an important signal transduction pathway in early stage in response to drought stress, and it may interact with auxin signal transduction through phosphatidylinositol 3-and 4-kinase.					zhang, yu/HNS-5948-2023; wu, meng/JPK-1930-2023														0888-7543	1089-8646				SEP	2022	114	5							110465	10.1016/j.ygeno.2022.110465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2022.110465		AUG 2022						36038061					WOS:000861025600003
J	Liu, R; Liu, Y; Gao, Y; Zhao, FZ; Wang, J				Liu, Rui; Liu, Yang; Gao, Yuan; Zhao, Fazhu; Wang, Jun			The Nitrogen Cycling Key Functional Genes and Related Microbial Bacterial Community α-Diversity Is Determined by Crop Rotation Plans in the Loess Plateau	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Soil nitrogen cycling microbial communities and functional gene & alpha;-diversity indicate soil nitrogen cycling ecological functions and potentials. Crop rotation plans affect soil nitrogen fractions and these indicators. We sequenced soil samples from four crop rotation plans (fallow, winter wheat monoculture, pea-winter wheat-winter wheat-millet rotation, and corn-wheat-wheat-millet rotation) in a long-term field experiment. We examined how microbial communities and functional gene & alpha;-diversity changed with soil nitrogen fractions and how nitrogen fractions regulated them. Planting crops increased the abundance and richness of nitrogen cycling key functional genes and bacterial communities compared with fallow. The abundance and richness correlated positively with nitrogen fractions, while Shannon index did not. The abundance increased with soil total nitrogen (STN) and potential nitrogen mineralization (PNM), while Shannon index showed that nitrogen cycling key functional genes increased and then decreased with increasing STN and PON. Introducing legumes into the rotation improved the & alpha;-diversity of nitrogen cycling key functional genes. These results can guide sustainable agriculture in the Loess Plateau and clarify the relationship between nitrogen fractions and nitrogen cycling key functional genes.																				2073-4395				JUL	2023	13	7							1769	10.3390/agronomy13071769	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13071769													WOS:001034716900001

Understanding pastoralists' dynamic insurance uptake decisions: Evidence from four-year panel data in Ethiopia	FOOD POLICY												Despite the demonstrated benefits of index insurance, its adoption rate remains low in many developing countries. While a growing literature explores the factors associated with insurance uptake, we still know little about its dynamic patterns. Using a unique data set covering four years and six semi-annual sales periods of an index-based livestock insurance (IBLI) product in southern Ethiopia, we examine the dynamics of pastoralists' demand for IBLI. We find that reduced insurance premiums induce households to purchase IBLI. While a oneshot subsidy can create a price reference point that may reduce the subsequent uptake, we do not find such price anchoring effects. We also find that overall uptake decision is positively correlated intertemporally, although there is no strong evidence for learning by doing or learning from others. Finally, we show that pastoralists are more likely to purchase IBLI when drought risk is high, consistent with the existence of spatiotemporal adverse selection. We discuss the potential of distributing discount coupons to trigger initial uptake and adjusting premium rates dynamically to avoid spatiotemporal adverse selection as effective policy tools toward sustainable livestock insurance. Overall, our study signifies the importance of an empirical analysis that considers the dynamic demand structure.

Buyer's Remorse and Peace of Mind Effects From Insurance	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS												We estimate the causal effects of index insurance coverage on subjective well-being among livestock herders in southern Ethiopia. By exploiting the randomized distribution of discount coupons and information treatments to instrument for the purchase of index-based livestock insurance, and three rounds of panel data, we separately identify ex ante welfare gains from insurance that reduces risk exposure and ex post buyer's remorse effects that may arise after the resolution of uncertainty. We find that current insurance coverage generates subjective well-being gains that are significantly higher than the buyer's remorse effect of an insurance policy that lapsed without paying out. Given the positive correlation in insurance purchase propensity over time, failure to control for potential buyer's remorse effects can bias downward estimates of welfare gains from current insurance coverage.

The present study modelled the sensitivity of TC size, intensity, rainfall, and destructive potential parameters under various ocean warming conditions. A recent extremely severe cyclonic storm FANI (2019) over the Bay of Bengal is chosen for this purpose. The 9-km grid-spacing Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations are performed by altering the default sea surface temperature (SST) by-1 degrees C, +1 degrees C, +2 degrees C and, +3 degrees C respectively along with the control run. The model simulations revealed that ocean warming causes the FANI cyclone to turn northeastward direction. The observed changes of tangential wind speed due to large sea surface enthalpy fluxes associated with ocean warming result in TC size changes and then guide the cyclone to northeastward movement. The radius of 34-knot wind (R34) is more sensitive to the SST warming compared to the radius of maximum winds. The modelled R34 values ranged between similar to 180-600 km against observations (similar to 100-400 km) during the TC life period. The increased tangential wind speeds (similar to 50-60 m s(-1)) and convective updrafts (similar to 1.3-1.5 m s(-1)) in the TC area are responsible for TC intensity and size changes. A linear and exponential growth is seen for the TC destructive potential indicators those estimated using TC intensity and R34 values. The SST increase could result in peak heavy rainfall (>65 mm day(-1)) in the TC inner-core region, especially the rear sector. The categorical rainfall distribution analysis also proved that heavy rainfall areas extend to greater distances (>300 km) around the TC center with SST warming. The study helps in assessing the hydro-meteorological destruction associated with the TCs in the future warming climate.

However, the dynamic and temporal changes in plants and the relationship with soil Be-7 concentration remain unclear, and the significance of dead plants in Be-7 interception is under-researched. Methods The samples of single plants (6 different species), compositive plants (including living and dead plants), along with soil reference on the Loess Plateau were collected individually to analyze the variations of Be-7 concentration during the growth period from 2010 to 2012. Results The accumulation of Be-7 per mass is significantly higher in leaves than stems. The 7Be activity per mass and per area in living plants with seasonal trends ranged from 173.9 to 703.1 Bq kg(-1) and 21.5 to 190.1 Bq m(-2), respectively, and in dead plants ranged from 381.8 to 964.5 Bq kg(-1) and 30.4 to 285.7 Bq m(2). Precipitation accounted for the largest contribution to the accumulation of Be-7 in plants, followed by plant growth, species and parts. Plants accounted for Be-7 interception on slope up to 66% (living plants accounted for 7%similar to 31% and dead plants accounted for 6%similar to 44%). The interception of living plants is low at first, then increases with the accumulation of rainfall and biomass together. Conclusions Our results highlight that Be-7 in plants (especially for the dead plants) is of great significance for Be-7 in soil on the slope, and is controlled by precipitation, growth status and plant characteristics. The reference information obtained in this work will contribute to improving the accuracy of Be-7 tracing technology, and broadening its scope.					Delang, Claudio O.

To understand the influence of drought and pluvial climates on peanut traits and yield, a phenotypic investigation of seventy peanut cultivars was conducted from 2018 to 2022; comprehensive field meteorological data collection, and typical drought (2021) and pluvial (2022) climates were recorded. The results revealed that the cultivars achieved the highest single plant pod weight (SPPW) and single plant seed weight (SPSW) of 61.03 g and 45.84 g, respectively, in drought conditions, followed by the control, and finally the pluvial. The SPPW, SPSW and eight agronomy traits exhibited significant differences across the different climatic conditions. Correlation analysis revealed the yield traits and key yield-related traits were positively or negatively correlated with soil water content (SWC), total global radiation (TGR), total precipitation (TP) and total net radiation (TNR). The intermediate and Spanish type cultivars were more stable and productive than the other botanical types of cultivars, commercial varieties exhibited better performance than landraces, and seven cultivars were identified with good production potential, under drought and pluvial conditions. Our study showed that pluvial climate was detrimental to peanut yield, and the SPPW and SPSW were significantly influenced by climates with genotype differences.						an, dong sheng/0000-0002-3164-8702; zhijun, Xu/0000-0002-9829-8444														2077-0472				OCT	2023	13	10							1965	10.3390/agriculture13101965	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13101965													WOS:001096021600001

Natural starch exhibits a low adsorption capacity for Cr(VI); thus, physical or chemical modification is needed to improve the adsorption and regeneration performance of starch. In this study, a novel starch-based porous carbon (SPC) was prepared to remove Cr(VI) from water by using soluble starch as a raw material. The characterization results show that the SPC shows a ratio surface area of 1325.39 m2/g. Kinetics suggest that the adsorption of Cr(VI) on SPC is dominated by chemisorption. The isotherm data demonstrated that the adsorption of Cr(VI) by SPC adhered to the Freundlich model. SPC exhibits a multimolecular layer adsorption structure, and the highest amount of adsorbed Cr(VI) in SPC was 777.89 mg/g (25 degrees C). Ion competition experiments show that SPC exhibits significant selectivity for Cr(VI) adsorption. In addition, the adsorption cycle experiment shows that SPC maintains a 63 % removal rate after 7 cycles. In this study, starch was transformed into high-quality adsorbent materials by hydrothermal and activation strategies, offering a new innovation for the optimization of starch-based adsorbents.																			0141-8130	1879-0003				JUN 30	2023	241								124597	10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.124597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.124597		APR 2023						37116837					WOS:000989853000001

Socio-economic and ecological benefits should be taken together under the circumstance of stagnant farming profitability and climatic variability. The effectiveness of various mulching strategies in rain-fed semiarid areas has been confirmed, but scarce the comprehensive evaluations of the conventional and new mulching strategies in terms of yield, economic benefit, and carbon footprint based on life cycle assessment (LCA) have been conducted. Hence, a two-year field experiment was conducted on maize (Zea mays L.) crop to explore the effects of four mulching strategies (PM: plastic-film mulching, SM: maize straw mulching, BM: biodegradable-film mulching, and NM: no mulching) on the yield, net return, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and carbon footprint (CF). The results revealed that PM and BM significantly increased maize yield by 11.3-13.3% and 9.4-10.6%. PM marginally raised the net return by 2.0-2.4% whereas BM slightly reduced it by 4.6-8.8% relative to NM. Unexpectedly, the yield and net return were the lowest under SM, and intensified N2O emissions, GWPdirect, and yield-scaled GWPdirect were observed. When the GHGs using LCA concept and SOC sequestration rate were considered, the lowest net GWP (1804.1-1836.4 kg CO2-eq ha(-1)) and CF (148.9-119.9kg CO2-eq t(-1)) were observed in the SM treatment due to the boost of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration. Conversely, PM and BM significantly increased the net GWP and CF compared to NM.When the tradeoffs between the high production, high net return and low net GWP were assessed by an integrated evaluation framework, the NM was recommended as an efficient low-carbon agricultural practice in the rain-fed semiarid areas.

The synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon spheres were activated by KOH to prepare high performance nitrogen-doped porous carbon material (PCM-N) for adsorption of Cr(VI). SEM, TEM, BET, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, XPS, Zeta potential and elemental analysis techniques were used to characterize the materials, and the properties of the materials were tested by a batch adsorption method. The results show that the specific surface area of PCM-N is 1600.67 m(2)/g, and the maximum adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) is 402.9 mg/g, and the performance was better than that of a similar materials (Longan seed and Fox nutshell and so on). Furthermore, the adsorption capacity will increase with increasing temperature. In this study, the kinetics and isotherm model of adsorption parameters are fitted, and it is found that the adsorption process is in accordance with the Pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Freundlich model, thermodynamic parameters show that the adsorption of Cr(VI) onto the PCM-N was spontaneous endothermic process. The regeneration adsorption experiment showed that PCM-N has good reusability and high application value.																			0304-3894	1873-3336				APR 5	2020	387								121987	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121987	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121987								31927256					WOS:000514758500021

In the world's semi-arid regions, soil crusts play crucial roles in maintaining ecosystem functioning. However, the true extent of soil quality improvement during the development of crusts is an issue not solved. In this study, four development stages of natural soil crusts, i.e., physical crusts (PC), biocrusts (BC), litter covered biocrusts (LBC) and litter crusts (LC) were selected in a semi-arid sandy ecosystem, along with a bare sandy land (BSL) as control area, to evaluate soil physicochemical properties at different soil depths. The coverage of litter (mainly leaves of Populus simonii) increased soil moisture and reduced soil bulk density. Compared with BC, the content of total soil organic matter (SOM) decreased in LBC by 13.83% and increased in LC by 36.57%. In contrast with BC, LC promoted a significant increase in soil nutrients, such as total nitrogen (30.30%), total phosphorus (46.89%) and available potassium (34.40%) in the topsoil layer (0-2 cm). Besides, LC contained higher clay and silt contents (10.47% and 29.81%) and lower sand content (-1.02%) than BC. In the 0-10 cm soil layer, the D (fractal dimension of the soil particle size distribution) of LC was the largest, with a value 5.71%, 6.1%, 2.44% and 0.93% higher than D in BSL, PC, BC and LBC, respectively. These findings reveal that litter covering facilitate the disintegration of BC, which further forms LC, and these processes clearly promote the enhancement of soil quality under sandy semi-arid conditions. Our findings are particularly important for predicting the transformation processes of sandy soil crusts and are of interest in ecological restoration programs.

Vara; Yang, Gaihe; He, Bing; Wen, Ronghui			Straw mulch decreased nitrogen fertilizer requirements via regulating soil moisture and temperature to improve physiology, nitrogen, and water use efficiency of wheat	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												The infrequent rainfall caused drought-prone conditions, particularly in semiarid regions of China, where most of the precipitation occurs in summer season. Thus, the summer rainwater conservation is very important for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) production. Therefore, a 2-year field experiment was conducted on straw mulch along with nitrogen (N) fertilizer to improve physiology, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), wheat yield, and water use efficiency (WUE). Maize (Zea mays) was a rotated crop after wheat, and therefore, maize straw mulch (S1, 0 kg ha-1; S2, 4500 kg ha-1; S3, 9000 kg ha-1) was in the main plots, and N fertilizer (N1, 0 kg ha-1; N2, 192 kg ha-1 [80%]; N3, 240 kg ha-1 [100%]) was in the subplots. The interaction of S3N3 and S3N2 produced 59.2% and 43.8% higher net photosynthesis and enhanced its characteristics at booting stage compared with that of S1N1. Higher Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) values (49.1% and 41.0%) and leaf area (85.6% and 61.0%) were measured with S3N3 and S3N2 treatments at booting stage compared with S1N1. Both S3N2 and S3N3 had increased wheat N-uptake (91% and 103%, respectively) compared to S1N1. While S3N3 and S3N2 enhanced soil moisture conservation, NUE (19.7% and 22.8%) and WUE (47.2% and 47.2%) improved the growth yield of wheat compared to S1N1. Higher wheat grain yield (7604 kg ha-1) was obtained from interaction of S3N2. Therefore, interaction of S3N2 is a viable approach for improving the winter wheat crop performance in terms of NUE, WUE, and wheat yield for semiarid areas in China.

PRODUCTIVITY AND PROFITABILITY OF FOUR CROP ROTATIONS UNDER LIMITED IRRIGATION	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE												Selection of optimal crops and cropping systems for most efficient water use specific for local environments can improve global water security. Limited irrigation with ground water is one alternative to alleviate crops from low amount or unevenly distributed water in the growing seasons in semi-arid regions. The main objectives of this research were to quantify yield-water use relationships of three limited irrigated crops, determine effect of crop selection on profitability with limited irrigation, and identify profitable and alternative crop production systems. Afield study was conducted at the Kansas State University Southwest Research-Extension Center near Tribune, Kansas, from 2012 through 2017. There were four treatments in the study, two 1-yr systems of continuous corn (Zea mays L.) (C-C) and continuous grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) (GS-GS) and two 2-yr rotations of corn-grain sorghum (C-GS) and corn-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (C-W). Overall corn yield after wheat (C-W) was about 1.4 Mg (ha)(-1) greater than C-C. Corn and sorghum yields were similar grown as monoculture or in rotation with each other. Available soil water at corn planting and during the growing season were 20 to 40 mm (240 cm profile(-1)) less in the C-GS rotation compared with C-C and C-W rotations. Corn yield increased as water use (yield-water use) increased in C-W rotation but yield-water use relationships tended to be negative in C-C and C-GS rotations. Grain sorghum yield increased with water use in both rotations but at a greater rate in GS-GS compared with C-GS. Despite greater corn grain yield in C-W, our economic analysis showed that wheat was the least profitable of the three crops causing the C-W rotation to be least profitable. In this study, the most profitable limited irrigation crop rotation was corn-grain sorghum (C-GS).																			0883-8542	1943-7838					2020	36	1					1	9		10.13031/aea.13416	http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.13416													WOS:000538385800001
J	Wu, GL; Cui, Z; Huang, Z				Wu, Gao-Lin; Cui, Zeng; Huang, Ze			Contribution of root decay process on soil infiltration capacity and soil water replenishment of planted forestland in semi-arid regions	GEODERMA												Large-scale afforestation has seriously aggravated the consumption of soil water and caused soil desiccation and even the dry soil layers, which has been restricting the survival and sustainability of vegetation in semi-arid areas. How to solve soil water deficit reasonably is an important practical problem we are facing. Here, a field experiment of the decayed roots with different times on soil water infiltration processed was conducted in planted forestland by a double-ring infiltration instrument, to determine the contribution of decayed tree roots on soil water infiltration process and replenishment. Results showed that the decayed process of tree roots in forestland could significantly reduce root density (RD) and increase the relative porosity improved by the roots (RPIR) (P < 0.05). The macropore formed by root decay could not only significantly increase the infiltration rate at each stage (P < 0.05), but also reduce the decrease rate of infiltration rate. Compared with bare land, the decayed roots of the 1-4 yr, the 5-8 yr, and the 9-12 yr increased the amount of soil water replenishment by 37.12%, 217.52%, and 259.85%, respectively. Overall, the decayed tree roots could maintain a relatively high and stable infiltration rate by reduced root density, which increased the effective replenishment of soil water of dry soil layers in forestland. These findings have potential implications for understanding the effect of decay process of tree roots on soil water replenishment, and provide a theoretical basis for the solution to dry soil layers and sustainable management of forestland in semi-arid areas.					, 菜鸟刘/GOK-1944-2022														0016-7061	1872-6259				DEC 15	2021	404								115289	10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115289		JUN 2021											WOS:000700886000015

Weed competition and control have major effects on yields and economic returns of the crop in the country. Among the weed management methods, development and use of weed competitive teff varieties remain the cheapest and most sustainable weed management option. Ten teff varieties were tested for their weed competitive ability in two locations. Treatments were applied using a split plot design with three blocks at each location for two consecutive seasons. Hand weeding and non-weeded treatments were applied to whole plot treatments with teff varieties assigned as split plots within the whole plot. The main objective was to determine relative competitive ability among teff varieties. Results showed that teff varieties showed significant variation in their weed competitive abilities. The varieties 'Kora' and 'DZ-Cr-387' significantly reduced weed density, dry weight, and cover more than the other teff varieties. They also had the lowest yield losses with a loss of 6% in biomass yield and 18% in grain yield recorded from 'Kora' and a loss of 17% in biomass yield and 21% in grain yield recorded from 'DZ-Cr-387'. Therefore, they showed the highest weed competitive ability compared to the other varieties.																				2073-4395				JAN	2020	10	1							108	10.3390/agronomy10010108	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10010108													WOS:000513232600108

However, the spatiotemporal variability of SOC for different topographic and land use types within small watersheds has not been adequately explored following the implementation of the 'Grain-for-Green' program. In this study, we determined the spatiotemporal variability of SOC content using the data collected in 1993, 2002, 2005, and 2012 and measured in 2018 and identified its driving factors for different topographic (tableland, sloping land, and gully) and land use types in the Wangdonggou watershed on the Loess Plateau. The spatial patterns of SOC content differed among tableland, sloping land, and gully, with higher spatial variability in gully than sloping land and tableland. The SOC content in the 0-20 cm soil layer in 2018 increased by 8.58%, 26.4%, and 22.2%, compared to 2002, for tableland, sloping land, and gully, respectively. Woodland and grassland had a great potential to sequester and stabilise carbon. The vegetation cover was a relatively dominant factor affecting SOC content throughout the watershed. Our results indicate a close relationship between SOC content and topographic, vegetation, and edaphic variables. This information is critical for understanding SOC dynamics at the watershed scale for sustainable ecological restoration.						huang, ming bin/0000-0001-9792-3124													1838-675X	1838-6768					2021	59	4					383	395		10.1071/SR19317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR19317		JAN 2021											WOS:000612620900001

As one of the indispensable components of the agricultural system, unpaved roads are significant sediment sources, but road erosion is often overlooked because of the relatively small areas that roads cover. This study aims to investigate the severity of road erosion under extreme rainfall and ascertain the dominating factor. We investigated road erosion in two small watersheds after a heavy rainstorm to measure rill and gully erosion on three types of road in the field and determine the factors affecting that erosion with remote sensing images and geographic information system (GIS). Using Google images before the storm and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images after the storm, we interpreted land use and measured geomorphological and vegetation factors. In 579 road cross-sections within 63 road erosion segments found along the 10.42 km roads surveyed, the average soil loss was 804.77 t ha<^>-1 from main unpaved roads, 471.78 t ha<^>-1 from secondary unpaved roads, and 147.46 t ha<^>-1 from trails. Gully erosion predominated over rill erosion on all three types of road. The average rill erosion was 0.41, 0.17, and 0.02 cm, compared with 4.88, 3.15, and 1.05 cm of gully erosion on the main unpaved roads, secondary unpaved roads, and trails, respectively. The contributing area dominated over other factors associated with road erosion under heavy rainfall and could explain 84.9% of the erosion from the road segment to which it drains based on the linear regression analysis. Furthermore, a nonlinear regression model with the contributing area and road segment gradient as predictors precisely predicted road erosion (coefficient of determination, 0.970).																			0167-8809	1873-2305				NOV 15	2019	284								106580	10.1016/j.agee.2019.106580	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.106580													WOS:000500212000003

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Contact angle, Zeta potential and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed; the obtained results showed that NCF has potential slow-release nitrogen properties. Additionally, the FTIR and XPS measurements revealed that NCF has various oxygen-containing active functional groups along with nitrogen-containing groups. A soil leaching test and the release kinetic model fitting of total nitrogen showed that NCF released nitrogen more slowly and over a longer time than urea, with nitrogen still being released after 70 days. Further, a mechanism study was performed, which revealed that NCF has a dual release performance that is similar to that of biochar and "dissolved black nitrogen." Moreover, the total nitrogen release behavior of NCF was dominated by the multi-effects of the coal carbon carrier, including electrostatic attraction, the unconventional formation of hydrogen bonds, and decomposition of the nitrogen-containing groups. Furthermore, the application of NCF in both soil types (Lou and Loessal soil) stimulated the germination rate of spinach seeds and improved the chloroplast pigment content as well as the nutritional quality of spinach leaves. These results suggest that abandoned weathered coal may be fully utilized in the mining area and that NCF may have promising potential in improving plant quality and sustainable agriculture applications.

J	Zhang, JQ; Li, YY; Yang, MY; Ma, B				Zhang, Jiaqiong; Li, Yuanyuan; Yang, Mingyi; Ma, Bo			Combined impact of moss crust coverage rates and distribution patterns on wind erosion using beryllium-7 measurements	CATENA												Although biological soil crusts (BSCs) provide considerable control over wind erosion in arid and semiarid regions, understanding of BSCs coverage rates and distribution patterns impacts on wind erosion is remain limited, which further causes poor quantification of BSCs factors in wind erosion prediction models. This study estimated wind erosion affected by moss crust coverage rates and distribution patterns using the weighting approach and beryllium-7 measurements through wind tunnel experiments, and screened factors that significantly influence wind erosion based on landscape metrics and multiple linear regression. Results showed that both moss crust coverage and distribution pattern significantly affected wind erosion and deposition. When moss crust coverage increased from 10% to 80%, average erosion rates in bare soil areas of trays almost all decreased logarithmically from 623.0 to 27.4 g m(- 2) min(-1), while the average deposition rates in moss crust covered areas decreased from-21.7 to-16.7 g m(- 2) min-1. Moss crust located at the middle area of trays (SCS) showed better overall erosion control effects, while moss crust located at downwind of sand (SC) showed better sediment trapping effects compared to other distribution patterns when moss crust coverage was the same. The SCS and SC patterns decreased wind erosion and deposition rates reached up to 81.9% and 38.0%, respectively. Moreover, wind erosion rates when arranged moss crust parallel to the wind direction resulted in significantly higher soil erosion (i.e., by a factor up to 7.3) compared to that of perpendicular to the wind direction. Stepwise regression showed that only wind velocity and moss crust coverage were included in the linear regression equation with a relatively low R2 value (R-2 = 0.35), but excluded other landscape metrics. This is indicated the importance of developing composite indices and their associative algorithms should be considered when quantifying spatial distribution impacts of BSCs on wind erosion.					li, yuanyuan/GZA-4435-2022														0341-8162	1872-6887				APR	2022	211								106005	10.1016/j.catena.2021.106005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.106005		JAN 2022											WOS:000790436600001

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of different afforestation ages on OC contents and C-m and Q(10) in bulk soils and aggregates. Soils were collected from 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depths in afforested woodlands after 10, 20, 30 and 40 yrs of establishment of Robinia pseudoacacia on abandoned farmlands on the Loess Plateau, China. C-m and Q(10) were measured in an 83-day incubation experiment at 25 degrees C and 15 degrees C. The results showed that long-term afforestation accelerated soil OC accumulation but decreased its C-m and Q(10) in bulk soils and aggregates, and the effects were greater at the 0-10 cm soil depth. Macroaggregates contributed most of the OC content (62%), but microaggregates and silt + clay contributed most of the OC mineralized (40% and 36%) in the bulk soils. The increased OC content and decreased C-m in aggregates suggested an increase in the sequestration of OC in fine soil particles. The temperature sensitivity of OC mineralization increased with increasing particle size, with a higher Q(10) value for macroaggregates (1.81 +/- 0.44) than for microaggregates (1.42 +/- 0.35) and silt + clay (1.31 +/- 0.14). Our results indicated that long-term afforestation would be conducive to the accumulation of OC and would decrease the release of CO2 from soils under future climate warming scenarios. The findings highlighted the OC dynamics in abandoned farmland were more sensitive to the temperature changes than those in forests, and the stability of OC in aggregates increased as the aggregate size decreased. This study contributed to bridging current knowledge gapes about the process underlying the observed OC budget and its response to warming scenarios in rehabilitated ecosystems.

At present, the preparation of removal materials is complicated, and the removal efficiency is not high. The adsorption effect of modified activated carbon fiber felt (MACFF) electrosorption and its influencing factors on NOR were studied. Activated carbon fiber felt (ACFF) was modified with 20% nitric acid, and the ACFFs were characterized by SEM, TEM, and FTIR both before and after modification. The optimal working conditions for electrosorption with an MACFF electrode were as follows: the voltage was 1.0 V, the pH was 6, and the plate spacing was 10 mm. The maximum adsorption capacity of the MACFF for NOR was 128.55 mg/g. Model fitting showed that pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir model were more suitable for explaining this adsorption process. In addition, this study found that, with 20% nitric acid as the regeneration liquid and under the reverse charging method, the regeneration rate of the MACFF electrode was maintained at approximately 96% and the regeneration was good, therefore, this technology can not only save operation costs but also has good development prospects in sewage treatment.						shen, weibo/0000-0001-9762-3105; She, Diao/0000-0001-9707-9322														2071-1050				MAY	2020	12	10							3986	10.3390/su12103986	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12103986													WOS:000543421400044

Methods This study used the Japan Environment and Children's Study dataset jecs-ta-20190930, released in October 2019. After simple analysis using analysis of variance and multiple comparisons, crude odds ratios (cOR) and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated. To evaluate eating habits, we examined habitual fast food and snacks (e.g., potato chips, corn puffs and tortilla chips) consumption, midnight snacks, and regular missing breakfast. Results There was no significant association between inappropriate weight gain during pregnancy and night shift work in early pregnancy. The aOR for consuming snacks more than once a week after noticing pregnancy for shift workers was 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.27-1.41; p < 0.001) compared with worker without night shiftwork. The aOR for shift workers consuming fast food more than three times a week during pregnancy was 1.40 (95% confidence interval 0.79-2.33; p > 0.05). Conclusions Pregnant night shift workers did not show excessive weight gain but had an increased frequency of consumption of snack foods compared with pregnant dayshift workers.																			1932-6203					OCT 12	2023	18	10							e0291579	10.1371/journal.pone.0291579	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0291579								37824450					WOS:001092548300028
J	Lou, JP; Wang, XM; Cai, DW				Lou, Junpeng; Wang, Xunming; Cai, Diwen			Spatial and Temporal Variation of Wind Erosion Climatic Erosivity and Its Response to ENSO in the Otindag Desert, China	ATMOSPHERE												Wind erosion is a major cause of soil losses in China's drylands which is further stimulated by climate variability and fragile ecological conditions. Climatic erosivity is an important index of wind erosion, therefore, evaluation of its spatiotemporal variations and relationship with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) will provide a theoretical basis for the comprehensive management and prevention of soil erosion. In this study, by using the climatic erosivity equation, geographic information system (GIS) and geostatistical analysis, we quantified the climatic erosivity, explored its spatiotemporal variations, and detected the effects of the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) on climatic erosivity in the Otindag Desert during the period of 1980-2016. The results indicated that the climatic erosivity (C-factor value) ranged from 82-445, and it decreased from the western margin to the eastern margin of the desert. The climatic erosivity showed a significant downward trend at seasonal and annual scales (p < 0.05). As far as spring, autumn and annual climatic erosivity, the whole region showed a downward trend, however, the summer and winter climatic erosivity varied spatially, in which the central and western regions showed a downward trend, but the eastern region showed an upward trend. The results showed that the average climatic erosivity is weaker during La Nina events than during El Nino events. The climatic erosivity recorded by 14 of the 20 meteorological stations, all located in central and west regions, exhibited a significant correlation with MEI (p < 0.05). The ENSO has a significant impact on climatic erosivity.

A field experiment was conducted by using two maize genotypes of Zhengdan 958 (ZD958) and Wuke 2 (WK2) and three N application rates of 86, 172 and 258 kg N ha(-1) with one control treatment in Yangling on the Loess Plateau of China. Grain yield, nitrate-N residue, nitrogen and rainwater use efficiency were evaluated in the 2013, 2014 and 2015 maize growing seasons. The results showed that the increasing application of N rate increased the soil NR, but no difference in soil NR was observed between the two maize genotypes at harvest. The "linear-plus-plateau" model could describe the relationship between N rates and GY, the mean values of optimal N rate and maximum GY were (149.1 vs 107.7 kg ha(-1)) and (7061.3 vs 6449.8 kg ha(-1)) in 'ZD958' and MU', respectively. Nitrogen application can significantly improve WUE. Compared to 'WK2', 'ZD958' had higher WUE, with mean values of 25.5 and 23.2 kg ha(-1) min(-1) in 'ZD958' and 'WK2', respectively. Nitrogen use efficiency and crop N recovery efficiency decreased sharply as the N rate increased; the mean values of NUE were 9.7 and 8.3 kg kg(-1) in 'ZD958' and 'WK2', respectively. Further analysis shows that, the green leaf area index and leaf N concentration were greater in 'ZD958' compared with those of 'WK2'. The findings suggest that the combination of N application rate of 149.1 kg ha(-1) with the maize genotype'ZD958'958' would result in the maximum GY, with improve in both WUE and NUE under rain-fed conditions.

However, the Loess Plateau, a typical region where a fragile ecosystem has gradually recovered, has high variability in soil aggregates due to differences in climate and soil properties; thus, the driving mechanism of soil aggregates to changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) content remain unclear. To determine the dominant mechanisms affecting SOC content, we performed a large-scale investigation of the aggregate size fractions, aggregate-associated OC, OC in bulk soil, and environmental factors of the natural grasslands across a climatic gradient (semi-arid to semi-humid) on the Loess Plateau. The results showed that the proportion of macroaggregates (MA) decreased but that of microaggregates (MI) increased in the soil from south to north on the Loess Plateau. MA content decreased with soil depth, whereas MI and the silt + clay fraction (SC) contents increased with soil depth. In addition, aggregate-associated OC decreased with soil depth. The contribution rate of macroaggregate-associated OCwf (MAFC) to OC in bulk soil from south to north in the Loess Plateau showed a trend of decreasing first and then increasing, and the contribution rates were 73.77 % (Fufeng), 62.29 % (Huangling), 32.78 % (Suide), 28.31 % (Shenmu), and 47.62 % (Dalad Banner), respectively. For the entire Loess Plateau, MAFC contributed the most to SOC in different soil layers and the contribution rates were 64.68 % (0-5 cm), 49.54 % (5-10 cm), 44.43 % (10-20 cm), and 37.23 % (20-30 cm), respectively. Across the considered depths and sites, the MA, MAFC, and OC content of MA had significantly (p < 0.05) positive direct effects on the OC in bulk soil. Furthermore, MAFC was mainly dependent on the OC content and proportion of MA. Therefore, these results indicated that the proportion of MA and OC content within MA dominated the OC dynamics in bulk soil in the Loess Plateau.					li, zy/HZM-1892-2023	Gan, Miao/0000-0001-8296-3182													0341-8162	1872-6887				NOV	2022	218								106533	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106533	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106533		AUG 2022											WOS:000874875100003

Zooplankton as an indicator of hydrological connectivity of the main channel and the floodplain in a large river system	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The connectivity of the river-floodplain system during floods plays a decisive role in organisms/matter contribution to the ecosystems of large lowland rivers. We hypothesized that the direction of water-level trends during flood was crucial for zooplankton release from the floodplain into the river channel. The seven-year study of zooplankton in the large plain Ob river suggest that at the inundated floodplain even a slight water level fall brings to plankton release from the floodplain into the river thus causing its abundance boom in the main channel. At water-level stabilization or rise, zooplankton communities of floodplain become isolated from the channel that ceases the recruits' inflow from the floodplain and brings to a sharp drop in number of river zooplankton. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account dynamics trends (i.e., fall or rise) in river water level when assessing zooplankton density in large lowland rivers. The analysis of such trends should become the basis for predicting of river zooplankton abundance and assessing changes in feeding conditions of fish during the growing season.

Gaining insight into secondary metabolites (SMs) is needed to extend our knowledge on the biology of Z. tritici. Here, the well-studied HC-toxin, a virulence factor in the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Cochliobolus carbonum, was chosen to test the hypothesis, that Z. tritici is equipped with the TOX2 cluster genes, a locus involved in the biosynthesis of the HC-toxin. We additionally assume that Z. tritici could generate this SM during the necrotrophic phase by killing the living cells, leading to the emergence of STB symptoms. We combined a bioinformatic analysis with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technique to investigate our claim. We found that all genes presented in the TOX2 cluster existed in Z. tritici IPO323, but the degree of identity between C. carbonum and Z. tritici is not high, ranging between 30 and 48%. Moreover, expression analysis showed that transcript levels of selected TOX2 genes are particularly high at the necrotrophic phase. We used the LC/MS technique to trace the HC-toxin in the culture filtrate of Z. tritici isolates. Our analysis indicated that the selected isolates were unable to produce the HC-toxin in vitro.

Changes in the cooccurrence network of soil fungal and bacterial communities after plant species grown under monoculture were analyzed with a greenhouse experiment using the rhizosphere soils collected from early-, mid-, and latesuccessional species in the field. Results showed that compared with the soil microbial communities of plants grew in their own soil conditions, significant changes were observed in the Chao1 and ACE richness of the fungal community and Shannon and Simpson indices of the bacterial community after the growth of plants in other stages of succession; the relative abundance of the bacterial communities were mainly affected rather than the fungal communities at the phylum level. The late-successional species (or mid-successional species) mainly increased the graph density and average clustering coefficient (network complexity) of the fungal and bacterial communities in soil conditioned by the early- and mid-successional species (or early-successional species). Soil water-soluble nitrogen and phosphorus were the main soil factor affecting the relative abundance of the fungal and bacterial communities in species succession. The pre-successional species may be replaced directly by the subsequent plant species in a succession sequence given the network complexity of soil microbial communities.																				2452-2198				SEP	2023	27								100733	10.1016/j.rhisph.2023.100733	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2023.100733		JUL 2023											WOS:001055066600001

Biocrusts and litter crusts play roles in improving the soil microhabitat of sandy ecosystems. Soil microbial communities mediate ecosystem functions in various ecosystems, e.g., soil biogeochemical processes. However, limited information is available about how the underlying processes of bio-crusts/litter crusts restoration are driven by soil bacterial communities in sandy land. Here, we investigated the changes in soil bacteria from three groups (sandy land, bio-crusts, and litter crusts) and three soil layers (0-2 cm, 2-5 cm, 5-10 cm) with nine replicates each collected in July 2019 utilized high-throughput pyrosequencing of the V4-V5 rRNA gene region. Most soil nutrients (SOM, AP, AK, and TN) and enzyme activities (BG and DHA) had differences among the three groups and three soil layers. OTU richness and diversity of bacteria were positively correlated with most soil variables. The constructed co-occurrence networks between soil variables and bacterial communities, and within bacterial communities showed that bacterial taxa had closer relationships with all soil variables in crusts than sandy land and varied among the three sand groups (sandy land, bio-crusts, and litter crusts). The result showed that the composition of bacterial community was regulated mainly by soil variables and crust types. Compared with sandy land, more predictors in nutrient cycling were found in crust types. They played major roles in nutrient cycling in desert ecosystem restoration on the basis of random forest modeling. Our findings indicate some bacterial taxa may played the predominant roles in connecting with soil variables and other bacterial taxa across crusts types, and litter crusts and bio-crusts drive the nutrient cycling by mediating the restoration of bacterial taxa in sandy ecosystems.					yin, rui/JOJ-5633-2023; Liu, Xiaozhen/JTV-1437-2023; liu, xiaozhen/HGC-1266-2022; Liu, Yu/JJE-7800-2023	Liu, Yu/0000-0003-0706-4026; Wu, Gao-Lin/0000-0002-5449-7134													0341-8162	1872-6887				APR	2021	199								105090	10.1016/j.catena.2020.105090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.105090													WOS:000608022600010
J	Ge, JM; Fan, J; Yuan, HY; Yang, XT; Jin, M; Wang, S				Ge, Jiamin; Fan, Jun; Yuan, Hongyou; Yang, Xueting; Jin, Mu; Wang, Sheng			Soil water depletion and restoration under inter-conversion of food crop and alfalfa with three consecutive wet years	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												With the implementation of the "Grain-for-Green" program, artificial vegetation was introduced on the Loess Plateau, which resulted in high soil water content (SWC) depletion. Currently, lack of soil water recharge is one of the most serious challenges on the Loess Plateau. Soil drying and wetting processes are critical for the sustainability of soil water recycling, but this has not been well studied. There is also a lack of physical definition of the upper bound SWC of dried soil layers (DSL). In this study, soil water dynamics - the change of SWC affected by precipitation and vegetation transpiration - were studied under converted vegetation. In-situ SWC measurements from the 0-5 m or 0-8 m deep profile over consecutive wet years (from 2016 to 2018 with an average precipitation of 660.9 mm) were analyzed to understand soil water depletion and restoration processes. Results showed distinct differences in soil water dynamics in the soil profiles and soil water balances under different vegetation types. SWC under continuous perennial alfalfa (Medicago sativa) had greater fluctuations between 0 and 300 cm than below 300 cm, and a DSL was observed below 300 cm. After converting from alfalfa to soybean (Glycine max), SWC increased greatly during the three wet years. Soil water storage (S) increased at an average rate of 35.8 mm year(-1) m(-1) within the top 500 cm of the soil profile, average evapotranspiration (ET) was 482.0 mm year(-1) , and maximum restoration depth of soil water extended to 660 cm. However, SWC gradually decreased over time after replacing food crop with alfalfa. S declined at an average rate of 21.4 mm year(-1) m(-1) within the top 500 cm of the soil profile, average ET was 680.4 mm year(-1) and the maximum depth of soil water depletion extended to 360 cm. These results suggest that SWC in deep layers can be depleted and replenished quickly, and the processes were dominated by vegetation types and precipitation. Taking vegetation types and soil texture into consideration, the calculation of upper bound SWC of DSL was redefined. Given the long-term effects of high water demand from vegetation such as alfalfa on the soil water balance, ET of vegetation should be reduced through conversion to less water-intensive vegetation types or biomass control (i.e. reduced planting density appropriately) in arid areas of the Loess Plateau.

However, the interplay between root exudates, microbial communities in the rhizosphere soil of canopy trees, understory shrubs, grasses, and their responses to nitrogen (N) deposition remains unclear. Pinus tabulaeformis, Rosa xanthina, and Carex lancifolia were used to investigate root exudates, rhizosphere soil microbial communities, and their responses to N application in forest ecosystem. Root exudate abundances of P. tabulaeformis were significantly higher than that of R. xanthina and C. lancifolia, with carbohydrates dominating P. tabulaeformis and R. xanthina root exudates, fatty acids prevailing in C. lancifolia root exudates. Following N application, root exudate abundances of P. tabulaeformis and R. xanthina initially increased before decreasing, whereas those of C. lancifolia decreased. Microbial number of rhizosphere soil of C. lancifolia was higher than that of P. tabulaeformis and R. xanthina, but there was insignificant variation of rhizosphere soil microbial diversity among plant species. N application exerted promotional and inhibitory impacts on bacterial and fungal numbers, respectively, while bacterial and fungal diversities were increased by N application. Overall, N application had negative effects on root exudates of P. tabulaeformis, inhibiting rhizosphere soil microbial populations. N application suppressed rhizosphere soil microbial populations by increasing root exudates of R. xanthina. Conversely, N application elevated nutrient content in the rhizosphere soil of C. lancifolia, reducing root exudates and minimally promoting microbial populations. This study highlights the importance of understory vegetation in shaping soil microbial communities within forests under N deposition.

This study evaluated the relationships between grassland plant root morphological characteristics and soil water infiltration rates (IR: initial, steady and average). For this purpose, five artificial homogeneous grasslands (Melilotus suaveolens, Medicago sativa, Panicum virgatum, Bromus inermis and Miscanthus sinensis) without irrigation or fertilization were studied in the Loess Plateau. The observed steady IR were significantly different between the 1-year grasslands: M. suaveolens > M. sativa > P. virgatum > B. inermis > M. sinensis. The root length density and root surface area were negatively correlated with the average, initial and steady IR at different soil depths (p < 0.05). However, the root volume did not significantly influence IR. The stepwise multiple regression determined that the main factors controlling IR were the root length density at the depth of 5 - 30 cm and root surface area at the depth of 10 - 20 cm. Our results provide insight into the influence of grassland root morphological characteristics on water infiltration in drylands and are of interest for soil water supply programs in forage production.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The coexistence of microplastics (MPs) and toxic metal contaminants in soils is becoming increasingly common, thereby posing serious threat to soil-plant systems. Cadmium (Cd) is the most common metal contaminant in soil and can easily combine with MPs, thereby altering its bioavailability. However, few studies have focused on the co-pollution of MPs and Cd, particularly the complex phytotoxicity caused by their interaction and the effect of co-exposure on Cd uptake in plants. We conducted pot experiments to compare the effects of exposure to polystyrene (PS) and Cd, as well as the effects of co-exposure (PS + Cd), on the physiological characteristics of Brassica chinensis L. and explored the regulatory factors of MPs on Cd uptake in plant tissues. The results showed that plant biomass, photosynthetic parameters, and chlorophyll content significantly decreased (p < 0.05) with increasing PS doses under treatment with MPs alone. Although the neg-ative effects of PS and Cd co-exposure on plants were higher than those of PS alone, however, the addition of MPs reduced the toxicity effects of Cd on plants and decreased the uptake and accumulation of Cd by plants compared with the Cd treatment alone. Furthermore, plants can resist the increased malondialdehyde content and oxidative stress induced by PS and Cd exposure by increasing the activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase. Under the PS + Cd treatment, linear models showed that soil organic carbon and sucrase activity were the key variables affecting Cd uptake by plant shoots and roots, respectively. The results of the partial least squares path modeling further showed that PS indirectly af-fected Cd uptake by B. chinensis by significantly affecting the physicochemical properties of soil, Cd concentration, and enzyme activity. Our results provide a new perspective and an important reference for further understanding the effects of MPs on the bioavailability and fate of heavy metals.

P.; Ma, Yongqing			Nitrogen and phosphorus supply strongly reduced the control efficacy of maize against sunflower broomrape	ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE												Heavy infestation by the root parasitic sunflower broomrape over wide regions constitutes a major biological constraint to sunflower production. The use of maize as a trap crop to induce sunflower broomrape germination is considered a cost-effective method for controlling sunflower broomrape. This study was designed to examine the activity of maize to induce sunflower broomrape seeds germination under varying levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization. Orthogonal experiments were conducted during two cropping seasons with four maize cultivars under four levels of N and P application. A significant reduction in sunflower broomrape germination induced by maize root and rhizosphere soil extracts upon N and P application was observed in both 2014 and 2015, with P having the strongest effect on the broomrape germination inducing activity of maize root extracts. Structural equation modelling analysis revealed that N and P supplementation not only directly affected the germination-inducing capacity towards sunflower broomrape of maize root extracts but also had an indirect effect through the impact on abscisic acid contents. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the connection between soil fertility and the production and release of germination stimulants in maize and that can lead to improved control strategies.

More specifically, it analyzes the program's role of boosting durum wheat varietal diversification and agrobiodiversity to support higher crop productivity and strengthen smallholder food security. The study is based on a survey of 1008 households across three major wheat-growing regional states: Amhara, Oromia, and Tigray. A doubly robust estimator was employed to properly estimate the impact of Seeds For Needs interventions. The results show that program activities have significantly enhanced wheat crop productivity and smallholders' food security by increasing wheat varietal diversification. This paper provides further empirical evidence for the effective role that varietal diversity can play in improving food security in marginal environments, and also provides clear indications for development agencies regarding the importance of improving smallholders' access to crop genetic resources.

Contrasting responses of beta diversity components to environmental and host-associated factors in insect ectoparasites	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. The present study investigated whether different components (species replacement and species gains/losses) of compositional and phylogenetic beta diversity of insect ectoparasites responded similarly to environmental and host-associated gradients using a large dataset on distribution of fleas and their rodent hosts in Mongolia. 2. Generalised dissimilarity modelling was applied to investigate whether environmental variables or host dissimilarity was the best predictor of species/lineage replacement and species/lineage gains/losses (= richness difference) components of compositional and phylogenetic flea beta diversity. 3. The total compositional beta diversity of fleas was influenced mainly by the gradient in air temperature and, to a lesser degree, by total host beta diversity, with the former effect being associated with the richness difference component and the latter effect being associated with species replacement component. The total phylogenetic beta diversity of fleas was best explained by the total phylogenetic beta diversity of hosts, with this effect being mainly associated with the lineage replacement component, whereas the lineage richness difference component responded mainly to the temperature gradient. 4. The results of the present indicate that not only multiple beta diversity facets are driven by different factors, but also different components of the same beta diversity facet respond to different environmental (for parasites, including host-associated) gradients. These patterns were masked when only total beta diversity was analysed. 5. This emphasizes the importance of considering the components of insect beta diversity separately. Ignoring the separate components of beta diversity can lead to potentially erroneous inferences about the relative contribution of abiotic and biotic effects on beta diversity.

J	Liu, L; Zhang, Y; Li, ZW; Xu, F; Zhang, QH				Liu, Lin; Zhang, Yi; Li, Zhongwu; Xu, Fei; Zhang, Qinghui			Effect of slope borders in reducing splash erosion during sediment transport by rain-induced overland flow	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Splash erosion plays a vital role in the loss of eroded materials. Unlike those in slope central areas, laterally ejected splashed materials in slope border areas cannot be replenished easily because slope edges prevent splash erosion particles from entering the slope. Thus, splashed materials in slope border areas are less than those in slope central areas because of the lack of source areas for splash-eroded materials. However, this phenomenon, called the slope border effect, has received minimal attention by researchers. The partially missing splash erosion induced by the slope border effect on sediment transport was investigated to understand the slope erosion mechanism further in this paper. A modified soil pan divided into four areas, namely, central erosion test area (length = 100cm, width = 35cm, depth = 45cm), border erosion test area (length = 100cm, width = 35cm, depth = 45cm), splash compensate border area (length = 110cm, width = 30cm, depth = 45cm) and splash collection area (length = 100cm, width = 2.5cm, depth = 45cm) was used to monitor diffusion and splash erosion under simulated rainfall. Results showed that the splash detachment rate increased with the increase in slope but initially decreased and then increased with the increase in rainfall intensity. The runoff rate and diffuse erosion rates for complete splash erosion (SE) treatments were higher than those without partial splash erosion (SEL). Under low rainfall erosive power and runoff transport capacity (e.g., 5 degrees slope and 60mmh(-1)), the transported clay in SE treatments was approximately 2% more than that in SEL treatments. This amount changed to more than 2% sand under high rainfall and runoff erosive power. However, the mass fraction accounted for by silt particles in the sediments of the SEL treatments was more than that in the SE treatments. Thus, the partially missing splash erosion can weaken the selective transport ability of runoff for sediments. The effect of missing partial splash erosion on diffuse erosion was enhanced with an increase in erosive power. The results of our paper will provide insights into the effect of the boundary effect zone of slope on soil erosion and its related mechanisms.

It has considerable economic potential and plays an important role in soil and water conservation. In order to conduct scientific cultivation of Chinese alfalfa, we collected 100 occurrence records from herbarium and publications and 19 climatic variables from BIOCLIM to simulate potential suitable habitat and identified the key climatic factors of Chinese alfalfa by MaxEnt and GIS software. The result shows that the MaxEnt model performed well, with an average test AUC value of 0.86 with 10-fold cross validation. The potential distribution of Chinese alfalfa is mainly in arid and semi-arid areas of north and northwest China, about 15.2% (1.46 million km(2)) of China's total land area, and the highly suitable area is Loess Hilly region and Xinjiang. The main climatic factors affecting the distribution of this species is hydrological-related factors (PDM, PS, AP, PDQ and PCQ), which explained 58.6% of the variation, and the climatic factors limiting the southern, northern, northwestern and Tibetan plateau boundaries were PDM, AMT, AP and MTCM, respectively. The climatic thresholds of the core area of Chinese alfalfa are 0.0-14.0 mm of PDM, 23.8-108.2% of PS, 3.9-15.5 degrees C of AMT, 14.0-664.0 mm of AP, 1.0-47.0 mm of PDQ, 2.0-51.0 mm of PCQ. The results improve our understanding of limiting climatic factors for Chinese alfalfa and suggest a priority management measures for areas with corresponding limiting climatic factor.

However, the spatio-temporal relationships between vegetation greenness and productivity and the factors influencing this relationship remain unclear. We define a new metric of ecosystem-scale photosynthetic efficiency (EPE) to analyse its spatio-temporal pattern and investigate how potential drivers regulate the greenness-productivity relationship. Location Global. Time period From 2001 to 2016. Major taxa studied Global terrestrial ecosystems. Methods This study used global datasets of leaf area index (LAI) and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) as proxies of vegetation greenness and ecosystem productivity, respectively, to propose a new metric of SIF/LAI, representing ecosystem-scale photosynthetic efficiency (EPE). We identified the spatial pattern and dynamics of EPE and examined factors influencing EPE. Results The results showed a weaker increase in productivity compared with the global greening rate from 2001 to 2016, suggesting a decline in EPE at the global scale. This decline in EPE indicates a disproportionate increase in terrestrial productivity against the widespread greening. When stratified into areas following an aridity gradient, we found that EPE overall showed upward trends in arid and semi-arid areas, and downward trends in dry sub-humid and humid regions. The EPE was controlled primarily by soil moisture, which promoted or constrained the EPE in xeric and mesic ecosystems, respectively. Moreover, the increase in short vegetation cover and atmospheric water demand contributed positively or negatively to EPE changes in xeric and mesic ecosystems, respectively. Main conclusions Our study shows that greening of the Earth is associated with decreasing EPE, revealing that current rates of carbon sequestration do not increase proportionally to greening of the Earth and highlighting that soil moisture is a key controller of EPE.

Rotation System	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Fallow, a field where living plants are unplanted for a period, is continually implemented to accumulate moisture for the upcoming cultivation. However, there are less studies on the fallow strategies in one-crop-per-annum cropping system for coastal saline soils. In this study, 2-year "fallow + maize (Zea mays L.)" rotation experiments were carried out from 2016 to 2018 to assess how the mulching determine post-fallow soil moisture, salt distribution, and crop performance. Three treatments were designed, i.e., traditional cultivation without residue retention (TT), traditional tillage with total straw mulching during fallow (TT + SM), and no-till cultivation combined fallow mulching (NT + SM). After 2 years of fallow mulching with maize rotation, TT + SM reduced soil electrical conductivity (EC) and total salt of the upper 30 cm soil profile by 22.9% and 25.4% (p = 0.05), respectively, compared with the TT treatment. The results also indicate an improvement in volumetric soil water content (SWC) by 10.3%, soil organic matter (SOM) by 17.8%, and ultimately grain yield by 11.3% (p = 0.05) under the TT + SM treatment. Fallow mulching is recommended as an acceptable way to protect soil health in coastal fresh-starved or rain-fed farming practice.

In order to explore the comprehensive utilization and recycling ofCaragana korshinskiibiomass, 15 kinds ofCaragana korshinskiibiochar (CB) were prepared by controlling the oxygen-limited pyrolysis process. Moreover, we pay attention to the dynamic changes of microstructure of CB and the by-products. The physicochemical properties of CB were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), BET-specific surface area (BET-SSA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), and Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The optimal preparation technology was evaluated by batch adsorption application experiment of NO3-, and the pyrolysis mechanism was explored. The results showed that the pyrolysis temperature is the most important factor in the properties of CB. With the increase of temperature, the content of C, pH, mesoporous structure, BET-SSA of CB increased, the cation exchange capacity (CEC) decreased and then increased, but the yield and the content of O and N decreased. The CEC, pH, and BET-SSA of CB under each pyrolysis process were 16.64-81.4 cmol center dot kg(-1), 6.65-8.99, and 13.52-133.49 m(2)center dot g(-1), respectively. CB contains abundant functional groups and mesoporous structure. As the pyrolysis temperature and time increases, the bond valence structure of C 1s, Ca 2p, and O 1s is more stable, and the phase structure of CaCO(3)is more obvious, where the aromaticity increases, and the polarity decreases. The CB prepared at 650 degrees C for 3 h presented the best adsorption performance, and the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity for NO(3)(-)reached 120.65 mg center dot g(-1). The Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order model can well describe the isothermal and kinetics adsorption process of NO3-, respectively. Compared with other cellulose and lignin-based biomass materials, CB showed efficient adsorption performance of NO(3)(-)without complicated modification condition. The by-products contain bio-soil and tail gas, which are potential source of liquid fuel and chemical raw materials. Especially, the bio-oil of CB contains alpha-d-glucopyranose, which can be used in medical tests and medicines.

J	Xiao, DR; Deng, L; Kim, DG; Huang, CB; Tian, K				Xiao, Derong; Deng, Lei; Kim, Dong-Gill; Huang, Chunbo; Tian, Kun			Carbon budgets of wetland ecosystems in China	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Wetlands contain a large proportion of carbon (C) in the biosphere and partly affect climate by regulating C cycles of terrestrial ecosystems. China contains Asia's largest wetlands, accounting for about 10% of the global wetland area. Although previous studies attempted to estimate C budget in China's wetlands, uncertainties remain. We conducted a synthesis to estimate C uptake and emission of wetland ecosystems in China using a dataset compiled from published literature. The dataset comprised 193 studies, including 370 sites representing coastal, river, lake and marsh wetlands across China. In addition, C stocks of different wetlands in China were estimated using unbiased data from the China Second Wetlands Survey. The results showed that China's wetlands sequestered 16.87 Pg C (315.76 Mg C/ha), accounting for about 3.8% of C stocks in global wetlands. Net ecosystem productivity, jointly determined by gross primary productivity and ecosystem respiration, exhibited annual C sequestration of 120.23 Tg C. China's wetlands had a total gaseous C loss of 173.20 Tg C per year from soils, including 154.26 Tg CO2-C and 18.94 Tg CH4-C emissions. Moreover, C stocks, uptakes and gaseous losses varied with wetland types, and were affected by geographic location and climatic factors (precipitation and temperature). Our results provide better estimation of the C budget in China's wetlands and improve understanding of their contribution to the global C cycle in the context of global climate change.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014; Derong, Xiao/AAA-3689-2019	Huang, Chunbo/0000-0001-6222-215X; Kim, Dong-Gill/0000-0003-3084-2658													1354-1013	1365-2486				JUN	2019	25	6					2061	2076		10.1111/gcb.14621	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14621								30884086					WOS:000467441900016

The miR396 family, one of the most conserved miRNA families, remains poorly understood in sorghum. To reveal the evolution and expression pattern of Sbi-miR396 gene family in sorghum, bioinformatics analysis and target gene prediction were performed on the sequences of the Sbi-miR396 gene family members. The results showed that five Sbi-miR396 members, located on chromosomes 4, 6, and 10, were identified at the whole-genome level. The secondary structure analysis showed that the precursor sequences of all five Sbi-miR396 potentially form a stable secondary stem-loop structure, and the mature miRNA sequences were generated on the 5 & PRIME; arm of the precursors. Sequence analysis identified the mature sequences of the five sbi-miR396 genes were high identity, with differences only at the 1st, 9th and 21st bases at the 5' end. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Sbi-miR396a, Sbi-miR396b, and Sbi-miR396c were clustered into Group I, and Sbi-miR396d and Sbi-miR396e were clustered into Group II, and all five sbi-miR396 genes were closely related to those of maize and foxtail millet. Expression analysis of different tissue found that Sbi-miR396d/e and Sbi-miR396a/b/c were preferentially and barely expressed, respectively, in leaves, flowers, and panicles. Target gene prediction indicates that the growth-regulating factor family members (SbiGRF1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/10) were target genes of Sbi-miR396d/e. Thus, Sbi-miR396d/e may affect the growth and development of sorghum by targeting SbiGRFs. In addition, expression analysis of different tissues and developmental stages found that all Sbi-miR396 target genes, SbiGRFs, were barely expressed in leaves, root and shoot, but were predominantly expressed in inflorescence and seed development stage, especially SbiGRF1/5/8. Therefore, inhibition the expression of sbi-miR396d/e may increase the expression of SbiGRF1/5/8, thereby affecting floral organ and seed development in sorghum. These findings provide the basis for studying the expression of the Sbi-mir396 family members and the function of their target genes.																			1932-6203					MAY 10	2023	18	5							e0285494	10.1371/journal.pone.0285494	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285494								37163544					WOS:001024724600001
J	Zhao, Y; Wang, L				Zhao, Ying; Wang, Li			Insights into the isotopic mismatch between bulk soil water and <i>Salix matsudana</i> Koidz trunk water from root water stable isotope measurements	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Increasing numbers of field studies have detected isotopic mismatches between plant trunk water and its potential sources. However, the cause of these isotopic offsets is not clear, and it is uncertain whether they occur during root water uptake or during water transmission from root to trunk. Thus, we measured the specific isotopic composition (delta H-2 and delta O-18) of each component (e.g. bulk soil water, mobile water, groundwater, trunk water and root water of Salix matsudana Koidz trees) in the soil-root-trunk continuum with a resolution of about 3 days. We report three main findings. First, we detected a clear separation between the isotopic compositions of mobile water and bulk soil water, but the distinction between mobile water and bulk soil water gradually decreased with increasing soil depth. Second, root water composition deviated from bulk soil water isotopic composition but overlapped with the composition derived for less mobile water. The maximum differences in delta H-2 and delta O-18 between bulk soil water and root water were -8.6 parts per thousand and -1.8 parts per thousand, respectively. Third, trunk water was only isotopically similar to root water at 100-160 cm depths, and it remained stable during the experimental period, suggesting that the trees consistently used the stable deep water source. In conclusion, the isotopic offset between bulk soil water and trunk water of S. matsudana reflected an isotopic mismatch between root water and bulk soil water associated with the heterogeneity of the soil water. Our results illuminate relationships between the isotopic compositions of soil waters of various mobilities, root water and trunk water that may be useful for advancing our understanding of root water uptake and transport.

Indeed, soil nematode metabolic carbon footprint, based on nematode biomass, is used to evaluate ecosystem functioning and assess nematode response to ecosystem nutrient enrichment. However, it is unclear whether vegetation restoration affects the metabolic carbon footprint of soil nematodes and soil food webs. We selected five periods for this study including: (1) farmland (0 years), (2) grassland (30 years), (3) shrubland (60 years), (4) pioneer forest (100 years), and (5) climax forest (160 years). Community composition, diversity, and metabolic footprint of soil nematodes, and carbon flow changes through the food web were investigated. The Shannon diversity (H') index of the soil nematode community increased in the process of restoration, and the Pielou index (J') appeared to be lower at 30 years after vegetation restoration than at 60, 100, and 160 years. The connectance of the soil nematode food web values increased continuously, from 30 years to 160 years, reaching the highest value at 100 and 160 years, which indicated that the food web had the strongest carbon flow at 100 years after vegetation restoration on the Loess Plateau, indirectly reflecting the stability of the soil food web. Bacteria were more important than fungi in the carbon flow in the food web during vegetation restoration. The study demonstrated that vegetation restoration promoted the input of the availability of external resources, enhanced the metabolic activity of omnivorous carnivores and the soil carbon flow, and stabilized the soil food web. However, the increase in vegetation restoration time not only changed the species composition but also changed the carbon input, due to the lack of interference by agriculture. Therefore, the intrinsic mechanism needs to be studied further.					杨, 兵/CAG-2883-2022; chen, wenjing/IZE-8536-2023	杨, 兵/0000-0002-8807-3794; WANG, jie/0009-0004-1824-7244													0341-8162	1872-6887				JUL	2021	202								105293	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105293		MAR 2021											WOS:000643594100054

However, functions of R2R3-MYB genes in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) remain elusive. Here, we characterized BnaMYB111L, which is homologous to Arabidopsis MYB111 and encodes an R2R3-MYB protein in rapeseed. BnaMYB111L is responsive to abscisic acid (ABA), heat, cold, hydrogen peroxide and fungal pathogen Sclerotinia scelerotiorum treatments through quantitative RT-PCR assay. BnaMYB111L encodes a transcriptional activator and is localized exclusively to nuclei. Interestingly, overexpression of BnaMYB111L in tobacco (Nicotiana benthandana) and rapeseed protoplasts promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and hypersensitive response-like cell death, accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as degradation of chlorophyll. Furthermore, BnaMYB111L expression evoked the alterations of transcript levels of genes encoding ROS-producing enzyme, vacuolar processing enzymes and genes implicated in defense responses. A further dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that BnaMYB111L activated the expression of RbohB, MC4 and ACRE132, which are involved in ROS generation, cell death as well as defense responses. Taken together, this study characterized the function of rapeseed MYB111L and identified its putative target genes involved in ROS production and cell death.

The located field experiment about the influence of different land-use types (LUTs) on nutrient contents and changes in the soil profile or the degree of influence over time was conducted for many years in Liudaogou watershed. The contents of soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (FP), available P (AP) and two inorganic N forms, ammonium-N (AN) and nitrate-N (NN), were determined in 0-200 cm soil profiles in five terraced and three sloped LUTs. The terraced LUTs were bare land (BAT), farmland (FAT), abandoned land (ABT), forage land (FOT, with alfalfa) and shrubland (SHT, with the peashrub Caragana korshinskii), and the sloped LUTs were farmland (FAS), abandoned land (ABS) and forage land (FOS). All of these LUTs were converted from traditional farmland except for FAT and FAS and they are carefully maintained for the last 50 years. SOM and TN contents were significantly higher after conversion from farmland to shrubland or grassland (15.6-34.9%) and decreased (51.5-77.1% for SOM in 0-40 cm, 49.7-72.1% for TN in 0-60 cm) with depth for all LUTs. TP and AN contents throughout the profiles were not significantly affected by land use, but NN was leached and accumulated in farmland only. AP content was highest throughout the profile in ABS when TP and AP contents were higher in sloped land than terraced land. SOM, TN and AN contents did not differ significantly for the same land-use patterns in the two topographies. SOM and TN contents in the surface soil increased with the length of recovery. Our observations demonstrated that the Grain-for-Green program has improved the nutrient contents and fertility of the soil and has increased SOM and TN stocks over time and that these effects were not limited to the topsoil. Abandoned land may be the optimal choice for nutrient sequestration in terraced and sloped land. Shrubland and artificial grassland are also recommended for increasing soil nutrient content in the area.

High infiltration rates favor an increase in the soil water storage capacity that allows maintaining vegetation restoration in arid and semi-arid regions. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is a quality perennial legume grassland, which is widely planted in semi-arid areas. In this study, the effects of the root channels formed by the decay of alfalfa on preferential flow were evaluated as a driving force to improve soil water infiltration and soil water supply. A double-ring infiltrometer (30-cm inner diameter and 60-cm outer diameter) was used to measure the infiltration process with the falling head method. Methylene blue was used to visualize the pathways followed by the infiltrated water. The results showed that the initial infiltration rate in the alfalfa grassland increased by 27.7%, compared with the control bare land, and the total cumulative infiltration was 1.13 times higher. The steady infiltration rate of the grassland increased by 31.8% compared to the bare land. The root channel diameters were measured with a Vernier caliper, and the average root channel area (RCA) was calculated through the average root channel diameter (ARCD). The values of ARCD and RCA were significantly and positively correlated with the infiltration rates, being the coefficients of determination 0.815 and 0.789, respectively. Our results indicated that root channels formed by the decayed roots of alfalfa played an important role in increasing soil water infiltration and soil water supply under semiarid conditions. Our research improves the understanding of the hydrological cycle processes at the plant-soil interface in semi-arid areas.

Molecular Genetic Diversity and Population Structure in Ethiopian Chickpea Germplasm Accessions	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is a cheap source of protein and rich in minerals for people living in developing countries. In order to assess the existing molecular genetic diversity and determine population structures in selected Ethiopian chickpea germplasm accessions (118), a set of 46 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers equally distributed on the chickpea genome were genotyped. A total of 572 alleles were detected from 46 SSR markers, and the number of alleles per locus varied from 2 (ICCM0289) to 28 (TA22). The average number of alleles per locus, polymorphism information content, and expected heterozygosity were 12, 0.684, and 0.699, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis grouped the 118 chickpea genotypes from diverse sources into three evolutionary and/or biological groups (improved desi, improved kabuli, and landraces). The population structure analysis revealed six sub-populations from 118 chickpea genotypes studied. AMOVA revealed that 57%, 29%, and 14% of the total genetic variations were observed among individuals, within populations, and among populations. The insights into the genetic diversity at molecular levels in the Ethiopian germplasm lines can be used for designing conservation strategies as well as the diverse germplasm lines identified in this study can be used for trait dissection and trait improvement.

Patterns of zeta diversity in ectoparasite communities harboured by small mammals at three hierarchical scales: taxon-invariance and scale-dependence	OECOLOGIA												We studied compositional turnover in communities of fleas and mites harboured by small mammals using zeta diversity metric (similarity between multiple communities) and asked whether the patterns of zeta diversity decline with an increase in the number of communities differ between taxa and hierarchical scales [infracommunities (parasite assemblages on individual hosts), component communities (parasite assemblages harboured by host populations), and compound communities (all parasite species in a locality)]. The average number of shared species declined with an increasing number of communities (zeta order). It attained zero at higher orders in infracommunities of both taxa with the shape of the zeta decline being best fitted by the negative exponential function, and the retention rate curves being modal. In contrast, zeta diversity values for compound communities of mites and fleas did not attain zero at higher zeta orders, and the form of the zeta decline was best fitted by the power-law function, whereas the retention rate curves were asymptotic. In component communities, the form of zeta decline was best fitted by either exponential or power-law function in dependence of whether communities were considered within a host across localities or across hosts within a locality and whether ubiquitous species were taken into account. Our main conclusions are that (a) the rules governing compositional turnover in parasite communities for the lowest and the highest hierarchical scales are taxon-invariant but scale-dependent and (b) species composition of infracommunities is mainly driven by stochastic assembly processed, whereas that of compound communities is mainly driven by niche-based processes.

Genome-based trait prediction in multi- environment breeding trials in groundnut	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Key message Comparative assessment identified naive interaction model, and naive and informed interaction GS models suitable for achieving higher prediction accuracy in groundnut keeping in mind the high genotype x environment interaction for complex traits. Genomic selection (GS) can be an efficient and cost-effective breeding approach which captures both small- and large-effect genetic factors and therefore promises to achieve higher genetic gains for complex traits such as yield and oil content in groundnut. A training population was constituted with 340 elite lines followed by genotyping with 58 K 'Axiom_Arachis' SNP array and phenotyping for key agronomic traits at three locations in India. Four GS models were tested using three different random cross-validation schemes (CV0, CV1 and CV2). These models are: (1) model 1 (M1 = E + L) which includes the main effects of environment (E) and line (L); (2) model 2 (M2 = E + L + G) which includes the main effects of markers (G) in addition to E and L; (3) model 3 (M3 = E + L + G + GE), a naive interaction model; and (4) model 4 (E + L + G + LE + GE), a naive and informed interaction model. Prediction accuracy estimated for four models indicated clear advantage of the inclusion of marker information which was reflected in better prediction accuracy achieved with models M2, M3 and M4 as compared to M1 model. High prediction accuracies (> 0.600) were observed for days to 50% flowering, days to maturity, hundred seed weight, oleic acid, rust@90 days, rust@105 days and late leaf spot@90 days, while medium prediction accuracies (0.400-0.600) were obtained for pods/plant, shelling %, and total yield/plant. Assessment of comparative prediction accuracy for different GS models to perform selection for untested genotypes, and unobserved and unevaluated environments provided greater insights on potential application of GS breeding in groundnut.

Pea (Pisum sativum L.) is one of the main sources of legumes due to its higher protein content. In the present investigation, 25 accessions of Turkish and Tunisian peas were characterized by fifteen ISSR markers in order to preserve this germplasm and develop new high-performance varieties. Means of diversity indices, Polymorphism information content (PIC), resolving power, marker index, major allele frequency and Shannon index were 0.70, 5.56, 3.20, 0.89 and 0.35, respectively. The analysis revealed a higher polymorphism (84.15%). The coefficient of similarity Jaccard varied from 0.45 to 1 exhibiting a greater genetic variety. The patterns detected by the cluster analysis, divided the 25 pea genotypes into three main groups. These findings were in agreement with the population structure which divided accessions into three main populations. Therefore, this paper has clearly shown the usefulness of the ISSR markers to provide a great degree of polymorphism for peas. The information collected from this work can help pea breeders to implement a selection program that improves the distribution of this crop in Turkey and in the arid regions of Southern Tunisia.

However, knowledge on the mechanisms, relating to soil legacy effects (soil chemistry and enzyme activity) and plant-soil feedback (PSF), driving community succession remains limited. In this work, we examined the PSF associated with three succession stage species through a 2-year greenhouse experiment. Setaria viridis, Stipa bungeana, and Bothriochloa ischemum were selected to represent dominant and representative early-, mid-, and late-successional stage species, respectively, of semiarid grasslands on the Loess Plateau. In response to the different soil origin, the shoot biomass of early-, mid-, and late-species were all higher when grown in their own soil than in other species' soils, which indicated that the PSF of three species were positive. Over two growth periods, the early-species experienced a negative PSF, but the mid- and late-species experienced negative, neutral and positive PSF in the soil of early-, mid- and late-species, respectively. Our study demonstrates that soil legacy effects and PSF have a significant impact on community succession processes.

Land use/cover changes are generally considered to influence soil infiltration. However, the effect of long-term vegetation restoration on the soil infiltration capacity and infiltration pattern is poorly understood. In the present study, we analyzed the infil-tration capacity with a double ring infiltrometer and detected the degree of preferential flow using a dye tracer in a typical loess hilly gully catchment of China. Additionally, we identified the relationships between soil char-acteristics and infiltration capacity and preferential flow. The results showed that (1) converting cropland to forest, shrubland and grassland generally enhanced the soil infiltration capacity. Compared with cropland, the steady-state infiltration rate (SIR) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) increased by 135 % and 155 % in shrubland, by 76 % and 91 % in forest, and by 22 % and 23 % in grassland. (2) Land use changes markedly increased the degree of preferential flow, following the order of shrubland > forest > grassland > cropland. (3) The decline in soil moisture (SM) and bulk density (BD) and the increase in total porosity (TP), macroporosity (MP) and soil organic matter (SOM) could cause higher infiltration capacity and preferential flow. SM and TP were the dominant factors affecting soil infiltrability, while MP was the greatest contributor to variations in preferential flow. Our findings demonstrated that vegetation restoration had a positive impact on soil infiltra-bility and preferential flow. This effect should be considered when assessing the influence of vegetation resto-ration on water resources in the Loess Plateau and other arid and semiarid regions.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2023	221		A						106770	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106770		NOV 2022											WOS:000907191600001

Soils from 0-20 cm, 20-60 cm and 60-100 cm were collected from three 100 cm profiles in bare land on the Loess Plateau. and incubated in buried pots for a year (July 2016 to July 2017) to simulate subsoil exposure, with ongoing monitoring of the microbial mineralization rate of soil organic carbon (K-c), using Li-Cor 8100. At the end of the incubation period, the exposed soil and the in situ control soil were sampled to investigate changes in bacterial community composition, as represented by 16S rRNA, and the activities of enzymes involved in soil carbon cycling. Both copiotrophic (Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria) and oligotrophic (Thermoleophilia) groups were stimulated in the exposed vs. control soil at 20-60 and 60-100 cm. The exposed vs. control soil from 60 to 100 cm produced the greatest bacterial responses, such as greater diversity and altered keystone groups (Thermoleophilia vs. unidentified Acidobacteria). Enzyme activities were greater in the exposed vs. control soil at both 20-60 cm (beta-D-xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase) and 60-100 an (beta-D-xylosidase and beta-D-glucosidase). The exposed soil from 20-60 cm and 60-100 cm had lower K-c and Q(10) values than those at 0-20 cm. Our findings revealed the existence of bacterial depth-specific responses to subsoil exposure, and highlight the effect of anthropogenic soil redistribution on soil carbon flux and its potential responses to future climate change.

Furthermore, in soybean growing regions, crop productivity and soil environment have deteriorated due to the use of traditional varieties and conventional methods of production. Soybean crop intensification or system of crop intensification in soybean (SCI) is an agricultural production system that boosts soybean yields, improves the soil environment, and maximizes the efficiency of input utilization, although the contribution of SCI to crop productivity is not well understood as different genotypes of soybean exhibit different physiological responses. Therefore, a field study was conducted in 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 using three crop establishment methods (SCI at a 45 cm x 45 cm row spacing, SCI at 30 cm x 30 cm, and a conventional method at 45 cm x 10 cm) assisted in vertical strips with four genotypes (Pusa 9,712, PS 1347, DS 12-13, and DS 12-5) using a strip-plot design with three replications. Compared with standard methods of cultivation, the adoption of SCI at 45 cm x 45 cm resulted in a significantly higher stomatal conductance (0.211 mol H2O m(-2) s(-1)), transpiration rate (7.8 mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1)), and net photosynthetic rate (398 mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). The implementation of an SCI at 30 cm x 30 cm had significantly greater intercepted photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) (1,249 mol m(-2) s(-1)) than the conventional method system, increasing crop yield from 9.6 to 13.3% and biomass yield from 8.2 to 10.7%. In addition, under an SCI at 30 cm x 30 cm, there were more nodules, significantly larger root volume and surface density, and increased NPK uptake compared with the other methods. Significantly greater soil dehydrogenase activity, alkaline phosphatase activity, acetylene-reducing assay, total polysaccharides, microbial biomass carbon, and soil chlorophyll were found with SCI at 45 cm x 45 cm (13.63 g TPF g(-1) soil hr.(-1), 93.2 g p-nitro phenol g(-1) soil hr.(-1), 25.5 n moles ethylene g(-1) soil hr.(-1), 443.7 mg kg(-1) soil, 216.5 mg kg(-1) soil, and 0.43 mg g(-1) soil, respectively). Therefore, the adoption of an SCI at 30 cm x 30 cm and/or 45 cm x 45 cm could provide the best environment for microbial activities and overall soil health, as well as the sustainable productivity of soybean aboveground.

In recent years, the lower Wei River has experienced regular flooding and drastic changes in river channel shape, causing significant harm to the economy and development of the lower reaches. This research investigated the morphological evolution features based on annual extensive cross-section data and water and sediment data from the hydrological stations of Xianyang, Lintong, and Huaxian in the lower Weihe River from 2006 to 2018 of river cross-sections and the reaction to water and sediment variations. The findings indicated that the lower Wei River's cross-sectional alterations between 2006 and 2018 exhibited a trend of "flushing at both ends and siltation in the middle" while continuing to exhibit "non-flood flushing and flood siltation" features. The incoming sediment coefficient in the lower Weihe River declined dramatically, whereas the median diameter of suspended sediment particles grew significantly at the Lintong station. The average elevation of the river channel was highly synchronized with the change in the coming sediment coefficient, and the impact of big floods dramatically influenced the shape of the river cross-section. Human activities such as river management have directly affected the morphology of the river cross-section at Lintong station and caused a significant increase in the median diameter of suspended sediment particles, resulting in siltation in the Lintong river. The study's findings can serve as a theoretical foundation for water and sediment regulation and river training in the lower Weihe River, reducing flooding damage.																				2073-4441				NOV	2022	14	21							3419	10.3390/w14213419	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14213419													WOS:000884118600001

The management of farmland can influence a variety of agro-ecological processes and affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Based on reported data, this study conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the role of conservation tillage (CT) in managing climate change in Northwest China. The results indicated that CT significantly improved the concentration of soil organic carbon (SOC), crop yields, and crop water use efficiency (WUE) compared with traditional tillage, and the practices with straw return were significantly higher than those without straw return. With an extended duration of the management, the SOC sequestration of each CT practice showed an increasing trend, but the crop yield did not show an obvious trend. After 5 similar to 16.16 t CO2-eq center dot ha(-1) and 8.22 similar to 21.53 t CO2-eq center dot ha(-1) compared to traditional tillage, respectively. In most CT practices, winter wheat-summer maize rotation (W-M) planting pattern had the best SOC sequestration, and spring wheat showed the highest increasing of yield and WUE. More specifically, compared to traditional tillage, the SOC concentration under W-M increased by 10.15 similar to 20.09%, and the yield and WUE under spring wheat increased by 6.87 similar to 17.83% and 8.82 similar to 46.32%, respectively. In conclusion, CT played a positive role in tackling climate change in Northwest China.

However, inappropriate grasslands construction can cause soil water deficit and soil drying in arid areas. In the present study, we evaluated the soil water storage deficit and soil water balance characteristics of different grassland types under natural conditions. The relative growth rates of planted grasslands, especially the planted legume grasslands, were approximately double higher than that of the natural grassland. Soil water storage deficit degree was the highest in the 0-50 cm soil layers than below the 50 cm layers. Soil water deficit degree was higher in legume grasslands than in gramineous grasslands below the depth of 50 cm, and it was significantly lower in the natural grassland than in planted grasslands below the depth of 200 cm (P<0.05). The precipitation (P) was lower than the evapotranspiration (ET) in planted grasslands, thus resulting in soil water deficiency and soil desiccation. The average ET/P value was significantly higher in planted grasslands than in the natural grassland, and followed the order of planted gramineous grasslands> planted legume grassland and shrubland > natural grassland. None of the grasslands got sufficient water supply during the growing season for transpiration and growth. Our findings provided evidence that natural grasslands have lower water consumption, and indicated which vegetation types can maintain more soil water and facilitate vegetation sustainability when undertaking restoration in water-limited environments.

Farmers' choice of salinity adaptation strategies might depend on how they perceive the problem. This research examined rice farmers' perceptions of salinity, adaptation strategies, and its implications for policy initiatives to sustain rice production in the affected coastal areas of Bangladesh. Boro rice growers (n = 109) randomly selected from two coastal sub-districts were interviewed using a semi-structured survey. Awareness of salinity and its increase over the past 20 years was widespread among rice farmers. A high proportion of farmers (90%) perceived the reproductive (e.g. booting, heading, and flowering) stages of the rice plant as the most sensitive to salinity problems. Salinity (ECe) was measured in the farmers' fields and were categorized according to farmers' perceptions and scientific interpretation (e.g. high or low). Farmers perceived a field affected by high salinity at a lower EC reading than the scientific interpretation of the salinity level. Most of the farmers (67%) were undertaking early transplanting and applying irrigation in order to adapt to salinity problems which occur later in rice crop growth during Boro season. Thus, farmers' actions demonstrated that their perceptions of salinity and adaptation responses were pre-emptive of when salinity was most likely to have an impact on the rice crop. Farmers' perceptions of salinization and measures to manage salinity need to be considered in research prioritization and policy formulation by the government. This action could potentially secure rice production and thus contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-1, 2 and 3). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Interception loss, throughfall and stemflow by <i>Larrea divaricata</i>: The role of rainfall characteristics and plant morphological attributes	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Rainfall partitioning into interception loss, throughfall and stemflow affects the amount and the spatial heterogeneity of water entering into the soil at the patch scale, strongly controlling net primary productivity of drylands. In this paper, we explored rainfall partitioning and its biophysical controls in Larrea divaricata (jarilla), one of the most abundant shrubs in the Dry Chaco rangelands (Argentina). On average, interception loss, throughfall and stemflow accounted for 9.4, 78.6 and 12.0% of total rainfall, respectively. Interception loss proportion decreased with the increment of rainfall event size and intensity, whereas throughfall proportion showed the opposite pattern. Stemflow proportion increased with the increment of rainfall event size but presented different relations with rainfall event intensity. The increment of rainfall event intensity increased the stemflow in small events (<20 mm), but decreased it in large events (>20 mm). Stemflow increased in plants with higher angles of insertion of stems (measured at 50 and 100 cm from soil surface; p < .05 and p < .01, respectively), but decreased in plants with larger canopy areas (p = .01). Spatial distribution of throughfall (coefficient of variation) decreased with the increment of rainfall event size and intensity. L. divaricata presented more stemflow generation and fewer interception losses than other similar woody species. Our findings help to understand the key role of vegetation canopy affecting the amount of water entering into the soil in drylands.

This study (a) estimates genetic parameters needed to design selection protocols that optimize genetic gains for yield under low-phosphorus conditions and (b) examines the utility of introgressed backcross nested association mapping (BCNAM) populations for diversifying Malian breeding materials. A total of 1083 BC1F5 progenies derived from an elite hybrid restorer "Lata-3" and 13 diverse donor accessions were evaluated for yield and agronomic traits under contrasting soil P conditions in Mali in 2013. A subset of 298 progenies were further tested under low-P (LP) and high-P (HP) conditions in 2014 and 2015. Significant genetic variation for grain yield was observed under LP and HP conditions. Selection for grain yield under LP conditions was feasible and more efficient than the indirect selection under HP in all three years of testing. Several of the BCNAM populations exhibited yields under LP conditions that were superior to the elite restorer line used as a recurrent parent. The BCNAM approach appears promising for diversifying the male parent pool with introgression of diverse materials using both adapted Malian breed and unadapted landrace material from distant geographic origins as donors.

Nutrient removal efficiency by floating macrophytes; <i>Lemna minor</i> and <i>Azolla pinnata</i> in a constructed wetland	GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM												The use of constructed wetlands for purifying pre-treated wastewater is a cost effective technology that has been found to be more appropriate for many developing countries. The technology is also environmentally friendly with the wetlands being habitats for many water birds and other aquatic organisms. This study assessed nutrient removal efficiency of two floating macrophytes (Lemna minor and Azolla pinnata). The data generated was analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. The significance level was maintained at 0.05. The results showed that the wastewater physicochemical parameters did not vary during the study period. The concentrations of nitrites and nitrates increased over the experimental period in all the treatments (Azolla pinnata, Lemna minor and control), and the increase between the sampling occasions was statistically significant for the two nutrients (Nitrates: F=24.78, P= 0.00; Nitrates: F=198.26, P= 0.00). To the contrary, in all the treatments the concentrations of ammonia, total phosphorous, soluble reactive phosphorous and total nitrogen, decreased over the experimental period. The decrease in concentration for these nutrients between the sampling occasions was statistically significant (ammonia: F=195.57, p=0.00; total phosphorous: F= 56.50, p=0.00; soluble reactive phosphorous: F= 37.11, p= 0.00; total phosphorous: F= 104.025, p= 0.00). Azolla pinnata proved to be better than Lemna minor in the uptake of the nutrients particularly for the soluble reactive phosphorous (F= 35.18, P= 0.044). We conclude that the two macrophytes are good for wastewater treatment. It is recommended introduction and/or multiplication of Azolla pinnata in the constructed wetlands meant for wastewater treatment especially within the tropics. (C) 2019 GJESM.

As the access to urban areas improves, the influence of economic development may alter local norms regarding the conservation of communal lands in rural areas. This study investigates how access from rural to urban areas affects individual and social norms regarding communal land conservation. We used interview data from 110 village leaders and 660 farmers' community group leaders in northern Ethiopia. Individual moral norms were estimated based on the respondents' willingness to participate in communal tree planting on communal lands as a means of halting and reversing land degradation. Social norms were estimated based on the proportion of exclosure in communal areas and the number of days a community member works without pay for communal land conservation. The relationships between the norms and urban access were investigated using probit and tobit regression models. The results reveal that access to urban areas positively affects the establishment of individual and social norms, suggesting that access to urban areas contributes to communal land conservation by facilitating intervention in rural areas, thus improving norms for natural resource management.

Here, we sought to evaluate the effects of soil moisture decreasing at different growth stages on biomass accumulation, water use efficiency, and plant-plant interaction of a C-3 leguminous subshrub Lespedeza davurica (L) and a C-4 perennial grass Bothriochloa ischaemum (B) when sown singly and as a mix in five different ratios in a pot experiment. Results showed that soil water decrease significantly reduced total biomass production of the mixtures by 3.7-53.8% compared with well-watered conditions, and plants at the heading and flowering periods were more vulnerable to soil water decline than those at the late stage. The relative yield total (RYT) of the mixtures was mostly greater than those sown singly. Soil water decreasing increased root/shoot ratio and water use efficiency (WUE) of the mixtures, and such effects were mediated by mixture ratio and/or growth stage. In the mixtures, a strong intraspecific competition was observed in B. ischaemum, whereas interspecific competition in L. davurica. The highest overall biomass (86.47 g pot(-1)) and WUE (6.33 g kg(-1)) were observed when the mixture ratio was B:L = 10:2 regardless of soil moisture, and thus could be considered an optimal mixture ratio for establishing restored grassland using the two species. Our results suggest that sown seed mixtures of the two species with an appropriate ratio could sustain a relatively high total biomass production and improve WUE under soil water decreasing conditions in the semiarid Loess Plateau.

Vegetation restoration is an effective measure for controlling soil erosion on dump slopes. However, few studies have identified the long-term influence of vegetation restoration on rill development on dump slopes. Therefore, we investigated the rill development characteristics of dump slopes with three typical restoration models (CK: natural restoration; ED: Elymus dahuricus; and AO: Artemisia ordosica) and three recovery time (1 y, 3 y and 5 y). The results showed that vegetation adequately controlled rill erosion on dump slopes. ED and AO could effectively control the development of rills with widths >15 cm and depths of 10-20 cm. ED vegetation restoration inhibited the development rill morphology and network better than AO. The rill erosion modulus of the ED slope and AO slope decreased by 76.29%-90.77% and 46.66%-61.49%, respectively, compared with that of natural restoration slopes with recovery time of 1 y, 3 y, and 5 y. ED controlled rill erosion better than AO, but this effect gradually weakened with recovery time. Vegetation coverage contributed 34.99% of the total variation in rill morphology and was the main factor affecting the development of rills on dump slopes. Furthermore, vegetation coverage had a more important role in controlling rill development than did the root system on dump slopes. This study provides valuable information for optimizing vegetation construction for soil loss control on dump slopes.					chen, zhuoxin/ABH-4099-2020; Guo, Mingming/ABH-4307-2020	chen, zhuoxin/0000-0002-8673-0498; Guo, Mingming/0000-0002-4887-5688													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAY 10	2022	820								153203	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153203		JAN 2022						35051460					WOS:000764882700014

With the intent of identifying current topics of major interest and development of research directions in the field of bioenergy under climate change, we conducted a bibliometric analysis and network analysis from a country perspective based on 3050 articles published since 1999 derived from the Scopus database. The results indicated that USA, UK, and Germany led other countries in terms of number of publications (1006, 366, and 280 articles, respectively) and h-index (greater than 50) in this research area. The USA has also produced a large number of articles in highly respected journals. Compared with developed countries, some developing countries (e.g., China, India, and Brazil) have a larger proportion of publications which are cited less than 10 times and researchers who have academic age of 1 year. The number of publications dealing with some of these research topics coming from developing countries has lagged behind the number of similar publications coming from developed countries. In spite of this, research on sustainable energy systems is still needed for developing countries to further establish feasible systems that can effectively promote global economic development and strengthen climate change mitigation efforts.

Here, we evaluated the combined effects of elevated CO2 and N addition on the soil-microbe-plant system of the Chinese Loess Plateau. Materials and methods A pot cultivation experiment with two CO2 treatment levels (400 and 800 mu mol mol(-1)) and three N addition levels (0, 2.5, and 5 g N m(-2) year(-1)) was conducted in climate-controlled chambers to evaluate the effects of elevated CO2 and N addition on microbial community structure in the rhizosphere of Bothriochloa ischaemum using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and associated soil and plant properties. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to identify the direct and indirect effects of the experimental treatments on the structure of microbial communities. Results and discussion Elevated CO2 and N addition both increased total and fungal PLFAs. N addition alone increased bacterial, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative PLFAs. However, elevated CO2 interacting with N addition had no significant effects on the microbial community. The SEM indicated that N addition directly affected the soil microbial community structure. Elevated CO2 and N addition both indirectly affected the microbial communities by affecting plant and soil variables. N addition exerted a stronger total effect than elevated CO2. Conclusions The results highlighted the importance of comprehensively studying soil-microbe-plant systems to deeply reveal how characteristics of terrestrial ecosystems may respond under global change.

The microbial composition and N-cycling genes were determined using metagenome sequencing. Urea fertilization significantly decreased soil bacterial diversity, possibly through its negative effect on plant diversity, whereas it increased fungal diversity, and microbial biomass and respiration through enhancing aboveground biomass production with increases in the C input into the soil. However, above the threshold N rate of 50kgNha(-1)year(-1), microbial biomass and respiration decreased probably because of a strong N inhibitory effect on aboveground biomass. Further, urea fertilization increased the gene abundances of narH, nrfA, nirB, and napA, which are involved in dissimilatory nitrate reduction, and those of nifH and nifD, involved in N-2 fixation, gdh, involved in organic N decomposition, and glnA, involved in glutamine synthesis and ureC. These findings suggested that urea addition has a positive effect on N-turnover potential. Burkholderiales and Rhizobiales play an important role in soil N cycling. Changes in plant community (diversity and biomass) were responsible for the shift in microbial diversity, biomass, and respiration, whereas alterations in inorganic N levels (exchangeable NH4+ and NO3-) potentially affected microbial N cycling. Our results show that N-mediated environmental stresses can play an important role in microbial diversity and functions, which appear to be mediated largely by plant-soil interactions.

In this study, the RUE and WUE of a shrub ecosystem in Central Asia were analyzed and ecosystem resilience based on RUE and WUE was evaluated by the contextual Mann-Kendall test and resilience index using datasets including MODIS and CRU data during 2000-2014. The results indicated that RUE and WUE had spatial patterns that decreased from low latitudes to high latitudes across the region. At the whole-region scale, RUE and WUE were relatively stable in most years. Spatially, more than half of the shrub patch area experienced an increasing trend in RUE and WUE over the past 15 years. For resilience assessments, a negative correlation was found between resistance and recovery, as reflected by WUE and RUE. The WUE- and RUE-based resilience components both captured a drop in WUE and RUE related to drought occurrence in shrubs, but the magnitudes of the RUE indices were much higher than those of the WUE indices in most shrub patches, suggesting that the negative impact of RUE on carbon accumulation of shrub encountering drought was greater than that of WUE. Based on RUE and WUE, resilience assessments were consistent in 41.81% of the shrub patch area and different over 58.19% of the area. Considering the characteristics of ET and precipitation datasets and convenient accessibility of precipitation data in underdeveloped areas, RUE should be easy to use in assessing ecosystem resilience to extreme drought.

A two-year field experiment including five treatments viz. no mulching with recommended N (N-225), film mulching with recommended N (F-225), high dose N (F-380), manure addition (F225+M), and no N (F-0) was conducted to explore the N2O production pathways in a maize (Zea mays L.) cultivation system using combined isotopocule and quantitative PCR analysis. The cumulative N2O emissions were 0.56 - 0.68, 0.70 - 0.71, 1.06 - 1.07, 1.50 - 1.54, and 0.16 - 0.19 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in N-225, F-225, F-380, F225+M and F-0 treatments, respectively. Nitrifier denitrification and/or classical denitrification accounted for 53.4 - 85.0% of the total N2O emissions in the high N2O emission period. Long-term film mulching changed the N2O-related community composition and led to a significantly higher fraction of bacterial denitrification and/or nitrifier denitrification (f(denitrification)) in most events, compared with those in bare land. A relatively low f(denitrification) and high N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratio often occurred in the F225+M (in mixing-reduction scenario) and F-380 treatments. Correlation analysis suggested that N2O fluxes were positively correlated with NO3--N, dissolved organic N, total N, soil temperature, soil organic carbon, and the abundance of AOB amoA and nosZ genes, whereas they were negatively correlated with soil pH and C/N. Overall, our results suggest that long-term film mulching and N fertlization strategies could impact the processes of N2O production and consumption, whereas denitrification was still the primary N2O production pathways.

However, the factors of alluvial fan development are poorly understood. According to our previous investigation and research, approximately 826 alluvial fans exist in the Lhasa River Basin (LRB). The main purpose of this work is to identify the main influencing factors by using machine learning. A development index (Di) of alluvial fan was created by combining its area, perimeter, height and gradient. The 72% of data, including Di, 11 types of environmental parameters of the matching catchment of alluvial fan and 10 commonly used machine learning algorithms were used to train and build models. The 18% of data were used to validate models. The remaining 10% of data were used to test the model accuracy. The feature importance of the model was used to illustrate the significance of the 11 types of environmental parameters to Di. The primary modelling results showed that the accuracy of the ensemble models, including Gradient Boost Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost, are not less than 0.5 (R-2). The accuracy of the Gradient Boost Decision Tree and XGBoost improved after grid research, and their R-2 values are 0.782 and 0.870, respectively. The XGBoost was selected as the final model due to its optimal accuracy and generalisation ability at the sites closest to the LRB. Morphology parameters are the main factors in alluvial fan development, with a cumulative value of relative feature importance of 74.60% in XGBoost. The final model will have better accuracy and generalisation ability after adding training samples in other regions.

Silicon (Si) was reported to have some alleviative effects on Cd stress in plants. However, whether Si alleviates Cd toxicity in maize genotypes with contrasting root system size are unknown. Methods Effects of Si application (200 mg kg(-1) soil) on shoot and root growth, Cd uptake and transportation under Cd stress (20 mg kg(-1) soil) were assessed at the silking and maturity stages of maize genotypes Zhongke11 (deep-rooted) and Shengrui999 (shallow-rooted) in a pot experiment. Results Application of Si significantly increased root dry weight, plant height and root length. Root volume and average root diameter were significantly positively correlated with root Cd concentration, bioaccumulation and translocation factor, respectively, of two maize genotypes at the silking stage. Addition of Si significantly increased Cd concentration, content, bioconcentration and translocation factor in roots of Zhongke11, but reduced the values of these parameters in Shengrui9999 at both growth stages. Grain Cd concentration in the combined Cd and Si treatment was decreased by 14.4% (Zhongke11) and 21.4% (Shengrui999) than that in Cd treatment. Grain yield was significantly negatively correlated with root Cd accumulation. Moreover, addition of Si significantly reduced Cd daily intake and health risk index in maize. Conclusions This study demonstrated that addition of Si reduced health risk by eliminating Cd accumulation in maize shoot and grain, and alleviated Cd stress with more profound effects in the shallow-rooted genotype Shengrui999.

This calls for the assessment of the current status and future trajectories of their populations. Using population data collected from three land-use types (e.g., grazing lands, riverine areas and natural forest) in western Tigray, we evaluated the vulnerability of the multipurpose baobab tree (Adansonia digitata L.) to human disturbances and climate change. The study was based on the premises that integrating ecological science with modeling tools and local knowledge would enhance the overall effectiveness of conservation strategies and community support. Therefore, based on field-based inventory, ecological niche modeling and a socioeconomic study, we characterized and mapped baobab current and future population distribution and documented local knowledge on the uses and management of the species. The characterization of the population structure showed that baobab stands were denser with larger-sized and taller trees in riverine areas and natural forest compared to grazing lands, suggesting adverse effects of human disturbances on its populations. Moreover, positively skewed size-class distributions with negative slopes in all land-use types indicated a low recruitment of juvenile trees to the adult stage. Climate change simulations using Maximum Entropy Algorithm (Maxent) revealed that future temperature increases would lead to significant reductions (41-100%) in baobab suitable habitats due to range contraction. The intensive harvesting of baobab leaves, branches and bark and lack of conversation practices as indicated by local communities, in combination with the risk of local extinction under future climate warming constitute serious threats for the viability of the species in western Tigray. The results suggest immediate interventions, such as planting baobab at up to 65 m higher in altitude, designing appropriate leaf and bark harvest strategies and protecting seedlings from livestock, will help guarantee the persistence of the species populations.

The Qinling-Daba mountains region (Qinba) is a transitional zone in central China with high ecological vulnerability and sensitivity. It is therefore essential to investigate the dynamics of precipitation extremes in the region. In this study, spatiotemporal variations of extreme precipitation events were analyzed at the monthly, seasonal and annual timescales based on long-term daily precipitation dataset at 30 meteorological stations over the Qinba during 1961-2017. The results indicated all of the selected ten extreme precipitation indices exhibited non-significant trends at the annual scales. Seasonally, most of extreme precipitation indices decreased in spring, autumn and winter, and increased in summer, whereas consecutive dry days (CDD) increased in all seasons. At the monthly scales, wet precipitation extremes mostly occurred in July, and upward trends of extreme precipitation events dominated in February, June, July and August except for CDD. Spatially, regionwide increases in extreme precipitation events mainly distributed in the eastern and southern Qinba, whereas the north and west were dominated by decreasing trends. Most of atmospheric circulation indices, especially Arctic Oscillation (AO), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Western Pacific Index (WP) were associated with extreme precipitation events at monthly and annual scales. East Asian Summer Monsoon Index (EASMI) and South China Sea Summer Monsoon Index (SCSSMI) strongly influenced extreme precipitation events in summer over the Qinba. Our results are conducive to understanding the variations of extreme precipitation events at the monthly, seasonal and annual scales, and these will be valuable for formulating the corresponding countermeasures at different timescales over the Qinba.

Recruitment of a critically endangered sawfish into a riverine nursery depends on natural flow regimes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The freshwater sawfish (Pristis pristis) was recently listed as the most Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) animal. The Fitzroy River in the remote Kimberley region of north-western Australia represents a significant stronghold for the species, which uses the freshwater reaches of the river as a nursery. There is also mounting pressure to develop the water resources of the region for agriculture that may substantially affect life history dynamics of sawfish in this system. However, the relationship between hydrology and population dynamics of freshwater sawfish was unknown. We used standardized catch data collected over 17 years to determine how wet season volume influences recruitment of freshwater sawfish into their riverine nursery. Negligible recruitment occurred in years with few days of high flood levels (above 98th percentile of cease-to-flow stage height), and relatively high recruitment occurred in years with 14 or more days of high flood levels. This relationship is indicative of a distinct boom-or-bust cycle, whereby freshwater sawfish rely almost entirely on the few years with large wet season floods, and the brief periods of highest water levels within these years, to replenish juvenile populations in the Fitzroy River nursery. This has direct implications for sustainable water resource management for the Fitzroy River basin in order to preserve one of the last known intact nursery habitats for this globally threatened species.

Here, an investigation of the spatio-temporal variability of soil salinity and groundwater dynamics across four different hydrological regions in oasis-desert system is performed. An evaluation of the effects of soil salinization and groundwater degradation interplays on the coexistence of oasis-desert ecosystems in northwestern China is undertaken over 1995-2020, utilizing comprehensive measurements and ecohydrological modelling framework. We note that the process of salt migration and accumulation across different landscapes in oasis-desert system is reshaping, with soil salinization accelerating especially in water-saving agricultural irrigated lands. The continuous decline in groundwater tables, dramatic shifts in groundwater flow patterns and significant degradation of groundwater quality are occurring throughout the watershed. Worse so, a clear temporal-spatial relationship between soil salinization and groundwater degradation appearing to exacerbate the regional water-salt imbalance. Also, the eco-environmental flows are reaching to their limit with watershed closures, although these progressions were largely hidden by regional precipitation and streamflow variability. The oasis-desert ecosystems tend to display bistable dynamics with two preferential configurations of bare and vegetated soils, and soil salinization and groundwater degradation interplays are causing catastrophic shift in the oasis-desert ecosystems. The results highlight the importance of regional adaptive water and salt management to maintain the coexistence of oasis-desert ecosystems in arid areas. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

For sustainable maize production, maintaining soil fertility is essential. This study aims to clarify nutrient removal by maize cultivation in fields located in the districts of Kenethao and Paklai in Xayabury Province-the main maize production area in Lao PDR. Field surveys were conducted at 27 plots in nine farmer fields in 2013 to measure maize production, collect plant samples for analyzing nutrient uptake and soil samples for analyzing nutrient stock in the soil, and interview farmers about cultivation practices and field history. N, P, and K removal by harvest from the fields totaled 51.7, 7.5, and 14.2 kg ha-1, respectively. Nutrient stock in the soil surface layer at 0-20 cm deep was 2980 kg ha(-1) as total N, 10.1 kg ha(-1) as available P, and 233 kg ha(-1) as exchangeable K. N and K stocks in the soil were sufficient compared with N and K removal in maize at harvest, although available P in the soil was similar in amount compared to P removal by harvest. Most farmers did not apply any fertilizer for maize cultivation. The N, P, and K balances in the fields were estimated at -47.6, -7.4, and -14.3 kg ha(-1), respectively, without fertilizer input, and were improved to -25.6, +1.4, and +5.5 kg ha(-1), respectively, by applying chemical fertilizer.																			0021-3551						2020	54	1					31	40																WOS:000518891400005

A sequence of multiyear wet and dry periods provides opportunities for grass recovery and state change reversals	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Multiyear periods (& GE;4 years) of extreme rainfall are increasing in frequency as climate continues to change, yet there is little understanding of how rainfall amount and heterogeneity in biophysical properties affect state changes in a sequence of wet and dry periods. Our objective was to examine the importance of rainfall periods, their legacies, and vegetation and soil properties to either the persistence of woody plants or a shift toward perennial grass dominance and a state reversal. We examined a 28-year record of rainfall consisting of a sequence of multiyear periods (average, dry, wet, dry, average) for four ecosystem types in the Jornada Basin. We analyzed relationships between above ground net primary production (ANPP) and rainfall for three plant functional groups that characterize alternative states (perennial grasses, other herbaceous plants, dominant shrubs). A multimodel comparison was used to determine the relative importance of rainfall, soil, and vegetation properties. For perennial grasses, the greatest mean ANPP in mesquite- and tarbush-dominated shrublands occurred in the wet period and in the dry period following the wet period in grasslands. Legacy effects in grasslands were asymmetric, where the lowest production was found in a dry period following an average period, and the greatest production occurred in a dry period following a wet period. For other herbaceous plants, in contrast, the greatest ANPP occurred in the wet period. Mesquite was the only dominant shrub species with a significant positive response in the wet period. Rainfall amount was a poor predictor of ANPP for each functional group when data from all periods were combined. Initial herbaceous biomass at the plant scale, patch-scale biomass, and soil texture at the landscape scale improved the predictive relationships of ANPP compared with rainfall alone. Under future climate, perennial grass production is expected to benefit the most from wet periods compared with other functional groups with continued high grass production in subsequent dry periods that can shift (desertified) shrublands toward grasslands. The continued dominance by shrubs will depend on the effects that rainfall has on perennial grasses and the sequence of high- and low-rainfall periods rather than the direct effects of rainfall on shrub production.

This study took the extreme drought event in southwest China in 2009/2010 as a case study. Based on the sunlight-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), we explored the effects of high-temperature weather on the photosynthetic efficiency, the vegetation responses to drought in two ecosystems, and the differences in influencing factors. The results showed a disproportionate change between the vegetation productivity represented by SIF and the greenness symbolized by the leaf area index (LAI). The response of photosynthetic efficiency to drought was significantly inequitable between the grassland and cropland. The geodetector showed that grassland ecosystems with more superficial canopy structures were more susceptible to high temperature. The correlation between the Photosynthesis efficiency index (PEI) and temperature (T) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of the grassland ecosystem was above 0.6. This study suggests that drought exacerbates the disproportionate change between vegetation productivity and greenness, and grasslands are more vulnerable to drought. The result is helpful for ecosystem management.

J	Zhao, W; Tan, WF; Li, SQ				Zhao, Wei; Tan, Wenfeng; Li, Shiqing			High leaf area index inhibits net primary production in global temperate forest ecosystems	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Within limited growth age in some regions, forest production, including gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP), was linearly correlated with leaf area index (LAI). However, over wide range of growth age in the global scale, LAI patterns of forest production are unclear. Here, we compiled a subset from the Global Soil Respiration Database (SRDB) for global temperate forest ecosystems. The subset database mainly included forest production, soil respiration, and LAI data in 493 study sites over wide range of forest growth age (0-500 years). The results showed that LAI initially increased rapidly, reached a peak at juvenility, decreased slowly until maturity, and again increased possibly with further forest aging (R-2 = 0.21, P < 0.001). We found that the dynamics of both GPP and NPP across global temperate forest ecosystems were driven by LAI. GPP initially increased and subsequently stabilized with increasing LAI. NPP peaked at LAI of about 5.6 m(2) m(-2), and subsequently decreased. The decrease in NPP resulted from the asymptotic increase in GPP and the continuing decrease in the NPP/GPP ratio with increasing LAI. The decline in the NPP/GPP ratio resulted from the significant increase in autotrophic respiration (R-a), and especially after canopy closure, R-a increased more quickly with increasing LAI than GPP. These results will improve our understanding of the control of LAI on ecosystem production.					zhao, wei/X-9123-2019; Tan, Wenfeng F./G-5736-2011	zhao, wei/0000-0002-6035-1836; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2021	28	18					22602	22611		10.1007/s11356-020-11928-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11928-0		JAN 2021						33420691					WOS:000606176500005

Hypoallergen Peanut Lines Identified Through Large-Scale Phenotyping of Global Diversity Panel: Providing Hope Toward Addressing One of the Major Global Food Safety Concerns	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS												Peanut allergy is one of the serious health concern and affects more than 1% of the world's population mainly in Americas, Australia, and Europe. Peanut allergy is sometimes life-threatening and adversely affect the life quality of allergic individuals and their families. Consumption of hypoallergen peanuts is the best solution, however, not much effort has been made in this direction for identifying or developing hypoallergen peanut varieties. A highly diverse peanut germplasm panel was phenotyped using a recently developed monoclonal antibody-based ELISA protocol to quantify five major allergens. Results revealed a wide phenotypic variation for all the five allergens studied i.e., Ara h 1 (4-36,833 mu g/g), Ara h 2 (41-77,041 mu g/g), Ara h 3 (22-106,765 mu g/g), Ara h 6 (829-103,892 mu g/g), and Ara h 8 (0.01-70.12 mu g/g). The hypoallergen peanut genotypes with low levels of allergen proteins for Ara h 1 (4 mu g/g), Ara h 2 (41 mu g/g), Ara h 3 (22 mu g/g), Ara h 6 (829 mu g/g), and Ara h 8 (0.01 mu g/g) have paved the way for their use in breeding and genomics studies. In addition, these hypoallergen peanut genotypes are available for use in cultivation and industry, thus opened up new vistas for fighting against peanut allergy problem across the world.

However, the results of previous studies in different regions are quite different. There is also a lack of in-depth research on the SF process of maize at each growth stage. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of rainfall characteristics and maize morphology on SF during the entire maize-growing period, quantify the stemflow rate (SR) in western Liaoning, analyze the differences in the maize SF process during different growing periods, and establish a multiple regression model for the different growth stages to predict SF. The results showed that the SR in the study area was 12.62%-43.44% during the 28 rainfall events from 2015 to 2016, and the mean SR was 32.80%. The mean SR during the jointing, tasseling, and mature stages were 24.10%, 42.72%, and 35.37%, respectively. SF generally increases with increased precipitation, and with an increase in the leaf area index, but the effects of various factors on SF differed between the early (jointing) and later stages (tasseling and maturity) of maize growth. A multiple regression model of the different growth stages was established to better predict SF in the research region. This study is significant as it improves local farmland water cycle theory and improves the efficiency of irrigation water. In the next step, the effects of leaf angle and canopy coverage warrant further investigation.					zhou, yang/JED-3951-2023; wang, KiKi/JFZ-3334-2023; Zhou, heng/JCN-6493-2023; zhang, chen/JES-0371-2023; Wang, He/JCO-3900-2023; Zhang, Yusi/JNS-2335-2023; yang, peng/JEZ-8452-2023; yang, li/JGM-1009-2023; li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023; zhang, yan/JGL-8022-2023; liu, bing/JJD-5566-2023; Ding, Yang/JUV-4842-2023; xu, chen/JNE-5010-2023; Zhang, Shiwei/JIY-4344-2023; Liu, yujing/JQI-7225-2023; yuan, lin/JDW-7387-2023; zhang, xiang/JJD-7003-2023; wu, p/JDW-5015-2023; Yang, Jie/JDM-6213-2023; Wei, Wei/JVM-8876-2024; Chen, Yu/JLL-0171-2023; Yang, Jing/JFK-4046-2023; Zhang, Yun/JCN-7026-2023; chen, Chen/JKJ-2122-2023; YI, J/JJE-7713-2023; zhang, hao/JOJ-7093-2023; li, wenjing/JMP-7498-2023; wang, yingying/JSK-6741-2023	Yang, Jie/0000-0002-3941-0053; Wei, Wei/0000-0002-4109-3878; Yang, Jing/0009-0004-8274-9863; dong, kebao/0000-0002-4466-6037													0002-1962	1435-0645				2023 MAR 13	2023										10.1002/agj2.21234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.21234		MAR 2023											WOS:000948287300001

Few catchments have had these estimates ground-truthed. One confounding aspect is that runoff and soil-water inputs commonly occur throughout the year; however, in climates with strong dry seasons, base flow can be directly sampled. In an experimental catchment in the Mt. Lofty Ranges of South Australia, run-of-stream hydrochemical parameters were monitored. In this Mediterranean climate during the Millennium Drought (2001-2009), the stream was reduced to disconnected groundwater-fed pools. Two groundwater types were identified: (1) high-salinity type from meta-shale bedrock with thick, clayey regolith and (2) low-salinity type from meta-sandstone bedrock with sandy regolith. End-member mixing using silica and chloride concentrations and robust Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios reveal an apparent groundwater-flow paradox as follows. According to chloride mass balance and spatial distribution of hydrogeological units, the low-salinity groundwater type has seven times more recharge than the high-salinity type. Over the 28-year record, low-salinity groundwater contributed 25% of stream water, whereas high-salinity groundwater contributed 2-5%. During the drought year, however, annual stream flow from the high-salinity groundwater contributed 50%, whereas low-salinity groundwater contributed 18%. High-salinity groundwater dominated dry-season base flow during all years. The paradox can be resolved as follows: The meta-sandstone terrane drains quickly following wet-season recharge and therefore contributes little to dry-season base flow. Conversely, the meta-shale terrane drains slowly and therefore provides stream flow during dry seasons and drought years.

However, relevant WP analyses are not available for maize production systems in China. A meta-analysis was conducted of maize WP in Northern China that included 2354 observations from 282 articles published between January 2000 and March 2018. Our goal was to quantify the current WP and its constraining factors, and estimate the boundary function for WP in the different maize agro-ecological zones of Northern China. The Northern China average WP across the large set of field experiments was 22.3 kg ha(-1)mm(-1), with Northeast China (NE, 25.8 kg ha(-1)mm(-1)) > North China Plain (NCP, 22.3 kg ha (-1)mm(-1)) Northwest China (NW, 21.6 kg ha(-1)mm(-1)). The boundary function for WP had slopes of 42.5, 36.8 and 40.4 kg ha(-1)mm(-1) for NW, NCP and NE, respectively. The WP was significantly correlated with latitude, vapor pressure deficit, N application rate, seasonal average temperature, experimental regions and years. WP was increased by optimal irrigation, soil surface with plastic mulch, deep tillage, straw incorporation into the soil, ridge planting, and the application of super absorbent polymer. In this study, we provided both reference WP values, recommendations to achieve higher WP and identification of regions with opportunities for improvement.					ying, hao/J-6540-2017														0378-3774	1873-2283				MAY 1	2020	234								106119	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106119													WOS:000525293700017
J	Li, SL; Bowker, MA; Chamizo, S; Xiao, B				Li, Shenglong; Bowker, Matthew A.; Chamizo, Sonia; Xiao, Bo			Effects of moss biocrusts on near-surface soil moisture are underestimated in drylands: Insights from a heat-pulse soil moisture sensor	GEODERMA												Understanding the physical, chemical, and biological processes and estimating water balance in drylands rely on accurate soil moisture (theta) measurements. Surface soil moisture is influenced by the presence and types of biocrusts because they strongly modify surface soil properties and hydrological processes. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to precisely measure the theta of such thin biocrust layer and to evaluate biocrusts' roles in soil water balance. Due to the large sensing range (usually >= 5 cm), the most dielectric soil moisture sensors are incapable of accurately measuring near-surface (<= 5 cm) theta, although they have been widely used for this purpose. Conversely, the heat-pulse (HP) sensor possibly performs better in measuring surface theta of biocrust layer because of its smaller sensing range (1.2 cm). In this study, we assessed the performance of HP sensor in investigating the surface theta differences between moss-dominated biocrusts and bare soil on the northern Chinese Loess Plateau. We measured surface theta of biocrusts and bare soil for one year at 1 cm depth using HP sensors, and at 2 or 5 cm depths using three common dielectric sensors based on alternative measurement principles. Our results showed that the relationship of theta and heat capacity from the HP sensor was quite well-fitted by a linear regression function (R-2 = 0.96), and the theta measured by HP sensor in the field agreed well with the oven-drying 0 (root-mean-square error <= 0.015 cm(3) cm(-3) and mean deviation < 0.007 cm(3) cm(-3)). The HP sensor measured a 44% greater theta under biocrusts compared to bare soil throughout the experimental period, in contrast to lesser differences detected with the other sensors (17%-33%). Furthermore, the biocrust increased theta by 100% in the dry season (Nov.-Apr.) and by 40% in the wet season (May-Oct.) in contrast to bare soil based on the HP sensor. Moreover, the theta of biocrusts measured by HP sensor was 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3) higher than that of bare soil under the periods without rainfall, but the biocrusts increased theta by 0.05-0.10 cm(3) cm(-3) in contrast to bare soil after rainfall. The apparent differences among different types of sensors were reasonably attributed to their variable sensing ranges and volumes of measured soil. Although the installation depths were different among HP sensor and dielectric sensors, HP sensor was undoubtedly more suitable in measuring near-surface theta and sensitive enough to detect even non-rainfall water inputs (dew, fog, and water vapor sorption) into the soil. In conclusion, the theta differences between moss-dominated biocrusts and bare soil are mostly underestimated by common dielectric sensors compared to HP sensors. Therefore, biocrusts play a more vital role in surface water balance of drylands than we generally recognized before.

However, the larger water evaporation after flooding seriously affects soil water maintenance, especially in winter and spring in the semi-arid and arid regions of north China. Hence, how to more efficiently maintain soil water content (SWC) after flood irrigation has become an important issue. This study examined whether ice-covered soil after flood irrigation can maintain high soil moisture based on a field investigation. Our results showed that the increase of SWC due to flood irrigation was markedly higher in the topsoil than in the subsoil layer, and the soil water supplement mainly happened on the cultivated horizon. Compared with the fields with no flood irrigation, SWC of the topsoil in the fields with no ice cover and with ice cover after flood irrigation increased by 56.4% and 75.6%, respectively. Farmland with ice cover presented a higher SWC than that with no ice cover after flood irrigation, and SWC increased for the topsoil and subsoil layer by 12.25% and 8.56%, respectively. Our findings proved that ice cover significantly enhanced soil water replenishment efficiency of flood irrigation to the soil layer, and the ice-covered soil after flood irrigation maintain higher SWC for both soil layers. The ice-covered soil after winter flood irrigation contributes to a better soil water habitat for farming production as an effective agricultural water management measure.

By constructing an indicator system of river basin sustainable development, the entropy method is adopted to conduct a quantitative evaluation of the cities sustainable development level for the Weihe River Basin in Shaanxi Province from 2009 to 2018, and the standard deviational ellipse is used to analyze the evolution of spatial distribution pattern of sustainable development in the study area. Furthermore, the obstacle degree model is applied to analyze the main obstacle factors restricting the improvement of river basin sustainable development. The results show that the sustainable development level of the Weihe River basin in Shaanxi Province improved slowly during the study period and significant regional differences among cities. This study provides a novel approach for future evaluation on sustainable development of the Weihe River basin and even the arid region in Northwest China, to achieve a win-win situation between economic and social development and ecological environment protection.

It affects agricultural background nitrous oxide emissions (BNE) through warming or cooling and precipitation changes, but the related mechanisms remain poorly understood. Therefore, using projections of future climate derived from a multi-model ensemble under three representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5), a grid-based spatial analysis was conducted to investigate the agricultural BNE by empirical statistical models and simulated suitable cultivation areas of rice and maize in China for 2006-2100. The results indicated that the spatio-temporal variation of BNE was dominated by temperature and the interaction effect of temperature and precipitation may also play an important role. Under the high-emission scenario (RCP8.5), the greater warming caused the potential BNE area of maize and rice to slightly migrate northward and the high-emission area was concentrated in southeastern China. The total BNE showed an increasing trend over time, from 120.59 +/- 0.69 to 142.42 +/- 0.78 Gg N a(-1) during the 21st century, driven by the synthetic action of these climatic factors. The findings of this study may provide reference for predicting future agricultural BNE and formulating appropriate measures to mitigate global warming.

The results showed that the mean particle size of SBP suspensions increased from 43.07 to 70.77 mu m at the pressure of 5 MPa and then decreased from 72.09 to 38.28 mu m as the pressure increased from 15 to 100 MPa. The steady state behavior of homogenized SBP suspensions could be well fitted by the Power Law model (R-2 (>) 0.998) and consistency coefficient (K) increased with the increased HPH pressure. The HPH treatment enhanced both storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G '') of SBP suspensions. Untreated SBP suspension (0 MPa) could be classified as type I (strain shinning) and transformed to type III (weak strain overshoot) after HPH treatment. Large amplitude oscillatory shear analysis revealed that as the pressure increased to 50 and 100 MPa, the trend of I-3/1 and I-5/1 with strain showed a transition from a "soft gel" to "hard gel". Confocal laser scanning micrographs showed that the red-stained areas of pectin substances increased as the pressure increased from 0 to 50 MPa, which further confirmed the cell wall breaking effect of HPH on SBP particles.																			0023-6438	1096-1127				MAY	2020	125								109245	10.1016/j.lwt.2020.109245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.109245													WOS:000525727600037

The N application rate and time may dramatically influence N recovery in the plant-soil system, in turn affecting residual N uptake by subsequent crops. A 3-year field experiment was conducted in plastic-mulched maize in semiarid farmland. N-15-labeled urea was applied to microplots with a single application (100% before sowing, N1), two splits (4:6 at sowing and eight-leaf stages, N2), and three splits (4:3:3 at sowing, eight-leaf, and silking stages, N3), and the fate of residual fertilizer N in soils over the following two cropping seasons was examined. Approximately 14.6-18.7% and 5.4-5.8% of labelled fertilizer N were recovered by maize in the second and the third seasons, respectively, with the cumulative recovery efficiency reaching 47.6-60.8% over 3years. Applying N with three splits significantly increased residual fertilizer N recovery by 24.6% in the second cropping season compared to N1 and N2. About 22.7-32.4% and 15-21% of total labelled N applied was residual in the 0-2m soil layer after the second- and the third-season harvest, respectively, with the higher residual amount from split N applications. In conclusion, split N applications significantly increased the cumulative fertilizer N recovery in the plant-soil system while decrease the potential losses over 3years, due to the higher recovery efficiency and the lower N losses from topdressed N.					wang, shaojie/HHY-8634-2022; Yue, Shanchao/D-1846-2009; Li, Shiqing/AAG-8907-2019	wang, shaojie/0000-0002-6818-3136; Yue, Shanchao/0000-0001-8724-2974; Li, Shiqing/0000-0001-6886-7637													1385-1314	1573-0867				JUN	2019	114	2					99	110		10.1007/s10705-019-09995-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-019-09995-y													WOS:000468242200001

This study surveyed and analyzed the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in a typical agricultural catchment located on the Loess Plateau, focusing on their response to heavy rainstorms. Microplastics were detected in all soil samples with an abundance of 70-4020 items/kg, and particles less than 0.5 mm accounted for 81.61 % of the total microplastics. The main colors of microplastic were white, yellow, and transparent, accounting for 38.50 %, 32.90 %, and 21.05 % respectively, and the main shapes were film and fragment, accounting for 47.65 % and 30.81 %. Low density polyethylene was the main component of microplastics identified using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The extensive use of plastic mulch film is a major contributor to microplastic pollution in this catchment. The differences and connections observed in microplastics imply mutual migration and deposition within the catchment. A check dam at the outlet effectively intercepts microplastics during the rainstorm, reducing the microplastic by at least 6.1 x 1010 items downstream. This study provides a reference for the effects of rainstorms on the sources and pathways of MP pollution in regions prone to severe soil erosion.																			0304-3894	1873-3336				OCT 15	2023	460								132416	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132416	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132416		AUG 2023						37657328					WOS:001073393300001

However, the risk of metal and/or nitrate residues and leaching within EDDS biodegradation remains as the bottleneck for the widespread application of EDDS-induced phytoremediation. This study aims to explore if the inoculation of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) can eliminate the risk associated with the short-term application of EDDS by investigating Cu phytoextraction and soil nitrate content. Results showed that EDDS application significantly increased the copper (Cu) concentration in shoots, soil total Cu, NH4+-N and NO3--N content, but decreased plant biomass. The inoculation of PGPRs in the soil showed a strong ability to increase plant biomass, Cu phytoextraction and soil NH4+-N content, and decrease soil Cu and NO3--N content. Moreover, bacterial dominant taxa were found to be the largest contributors to soil NH4+-N and NO3--N variation, and the abundance of denitrifying bacteria (Bacteroidetes and Stenotrophomonas) decreased in the treatment with PGPRs. The risk of residual Cu and nitrate leaching was reduced by the inoculation of PGPRs without significantly changing the stability of the bacterial community. These new findings indicate that the exogenous application of beneficial rhizobacteria can provide an effective strategy to reduce the risk in metal-contaminated soils of chelant-assisted phytoextraction.

We identified a suite of decomposition-associated bacterial and fungal groups in straw that contribute to C and N cycling. The decomposition-associated microbial community in straw is likely mainly derived from the original straw, and the bacterial and fungal communities showed different patterns along with the decomposition. Overall, the microbial community composition and function were not substantially affected by the N fertilization rate, but N fertilization significantly increased the straw microbial assembly speed and had significant effects on the abundances of certain taxa and C- and N-related genes, leading to different decomposition rates of straw under different N fertilization rates. Furthermore, the straw quality, especially dissolved organic C (DOC) and lignin, accounted for most observed effects on microbial community development and decomposition. The results provide new insight into the roles of the microbial community in straw during crop residue decomposition for nutrient cycling in farmland ecosystems.

However, the responses of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient turnover to microbial metabolic limitation under changing precipitation conditions remain unclear in semi-arid ecosystems. This study measured the potential activities of enzymes associated with carbon (C: beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG) and beta-D-cellobiosidase (CBH)), nitrogen (N: beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) and L-leucine aminopeptidase (LAP)) and phosphorus (P: alkaline phosphatase (AP)) acquisition, to quantify soil microbial metabolic limitations using enzymatic stoichiometry, and then identify the implications for soil microbial metabolic limitations and carbon use efficiency (CUE) under decreased precipitation by 50% (DP) and increased precipitation by 50% (IP) in a temperate grassland. The results showed that soil C and P were the major elements limiting soil microbial metabolism in temperate grasslands. There was a strong positive dependence between microbial C and P limitations under manipulated precipitation. Microbial metabolism limitation was promoted by DP treatment but reversed by IP treatment. Moreover, CUE was inhibited by DP treatment but promoted by IP treatment. Soil microbial metabolism limitation was mainly regulated by soil moisture and soil C, N, and P stoichiometry, followed by available nutrients (i.e., NO3(-), NH4(+), and dissolved organic C) and microbial biomass (i.e., MBC and MBN). Overall, these findings highlight the potential role of changing precipitation in regulating ecosystem C turnover by limiting microbial metabolism and CUE in temperate grassland ecosystems.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014; li, jianping/HGB-6631-2022	Wu, Jianzhao/0000-0003-3124-1109; li, jianping/0000-0003-3761-9950													1674-6767	2194-7783				OCT	2022	14	10					1109	1123		10.1007/s40333-022-0028-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-022-0028-6													WOS:000869835500004

This study investigated suspended sediment (SS) transport characteristics in a typical catchment with two geomorphological types (aeolian sand and loess hilly). Lorenz curves and partial least-squares regression were used to quantify the SS transport characteristics and attributions. New hydrological insights for the region:There were significant differences in the SS transport characteristics between the two geomorphological regions. In the aeolian sand region, the mean annual SS loads were much lower than that in the loess hilly region (P < 0.01) under similar precipitation and runoff conditions. Rivers in this region transported SS all year round. The relatively lower concentration indicated that extreme events did not dominate total SS load. Conversely, SS transport in the loess hilly region was highly concentrated during a few events in rainy season, with the largest 10% of the events transporting exceed 80% of the total SS load. Statistical analysis showed that drainage density, catchment slope, and soil texture were the dominant factors controlling SS load, while the concentration of SS transport events was more related to the perimeter-area fractal. These findings have important implications for fluvial sediment transport in arid and semi-arid environments.

It is of substantial interest to study the spatial distribution of SPP owing to the high spatial variability caused by land consolidation under various land restoration modes in excavated farmland in the loess hilly area of China. In our study, three land restoration modes were selected including natural restoration land (NR), alfalfa land (AL) and maize land (ML). Soil texture composition, including the contents of clay, silt and sand, field capacity (FC), saturated conductivity (Ks) and bulk density (BD) were determined using a multifractal analysis. SPP were found to possess variable characteristics, although land consolidation destroyed the soil structure and decreased the spatial autocorrelation. Furthermore, SPP varied with land restoration and could be illustrated by the multifractal parameters of D-1, Delta D, Delta a and Delta f in different modes of land restoration. Owing to multiple compaction from large machinery in the surface soil, soil particles were fine-grained and increased the spatial variability in soil texture composition under all the land restoration modes. Plough numbers and vegetative root characteristics had the most significant impacts on the improvement in SPP, which resulted in the best spatial distribution characteristics of SPP found in ML compared with those in AL and NR. In addition, compared with ML, Delta a values of NR and AL were 4.9- and 3.0-fold that of FC, respectively, and Delta a values of NR and AL were 2.3- and 1.5-fold higher than those of K-s, respectively. These results indicate that SPP can be rapidly improved by increasing plough numbers and planting vegetation types after land consolidation. Thus, we conclude that ML is an optimal land restoration mode that results in favorable conditions to rapidly improve SPP.

Six wheat genotypes were studied for 2 years with pot cultivation in rain-shelter. Among different genotypes, stomatal conductance (g(s)) was significantly correlated with both P-N and Tr. But for each genotype, though g(s) was significantly correlated with P-N regardless of relative air humidity (RH) status and it was also significantly correlated with Tr under lower RH (LRH, 15.4%) and moderate RH (MRH, 28.3%), it was not correlated with Tr under higher RH (HRH, 36.7%) during the diurnal changes. The conditional correlation between g(s) and Tr of wheat evoked new thinking on the relationships among g(s), P-N and Tr. Path analysis was further carried out to clarify the correlations of g(s) with the four atmospheric factors, that of Tr with g(s) and the four factors and the direct and indirect effects of the factors, during their diurnal dynamic variation. The effects of these factors on g(s) or Tr were related to RH. All the four factors had a much higher correlation with g(s) under HRH than that under LRH and MRH. Air temperature (T) had a rather higher direct effect than RH and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Also, the other factors had a much higher indirect effect on g(s) through vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and T. Transpiration rate was highly correlated with g(s) under LRH and MRH, with g(s) having a higher direct effect on it. In comparison, Tr was not correlated with g(s) under HRH but highly correlated with the atmospheric factors, with T, RH, and PAR having a higher indirect effect through VPD.

Crantz), as a new emerging oil crop	PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES-CHARACTERIZATION AND UTILIZATION												Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz), an oilseed crop, belongs to the Brassicaceae family. Two unique features of camelina in comparison with the main oil crops are an adaptation to different environments and also its unique oil composition. The development of doubled haploid plants is one of the essential methods for crop improvement. The study of genetic diversity is an important step in planning crop breeding programmes. This research was conducted to evaluate the genetic variation of 81 camelina doubled haploid lines obtained from 15 crosses by inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. The total number of amplified bands was 243, of which 239 bands (98.3%) showed polymorphism. The percentage of polymorphic bands varied between 93.75 and 100. The size of the bands ranged from 50 to 1700 base pairs. The informative ISSRs were identified by estimating marker features: polymorphism information content, effective multiplex ratio, marker index and resolving power. Three markers had higher resolving power values (9.88, 8.5 and 7.46) and were the most informative markers to identify the lines. Cluster analysis based on the complete algorithm divided the lines into five groups, indicating relatively clear configuration from the geographic distribution patterns of the parents of the doubled haploid lines.

Low temperature (LT) stress confines the growth and productivity of maize. In this context, two maize genotypes, LT tolerant Gurez local and LT susceptible Gujarat-Maize-6 (G-M-6) were analysed in present study for various osmolytes and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes including Ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) besides trehalose biosynthetic pathways. With the progressive LT treatment, Gurez local showed lesser accumulation of stress markers like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde, a significant increase in osmoprotectants like free proline, total protein, total soluble sugars, trehalose, total phenolics and glycine betaine, and a significant reduction in the plant pigments as compared to the G-M-6. Additionally, Gurez local was found to possess a well-established antioxidant defense system as revealed from the elevated transcripts and enzyme activities of various enzymes of AsA-GSH pathway. Higher gene expression and enzyme activities were exhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase besides the gene expression of trehalose biosynthetic pathway enzymes. Moreover, through principal component analyses, a positive correlation of all analysed parameters with the LT tolerance was noticed in Gurez local alone demarcating the genotypes on the basis of their extent of LT tolerance. Overall, the present study forms the basis for unravelling of LT tolerance mechanisms and improvement in the performance of the temperate maize.

Systematic documentation of cover cropping effects on soil microbial abundance and community structure, however, is scarce. A meta-analysis including data from 81 available studies was conducted to elucidate the effect of "cover crop" versus "no cover crop" on soil microbial community abundance and structure. Microbial biomass C and N (MBC and MBN) and total phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA) were taken as proxies for soil microbial abundance, and total fungi, total bacteria, gram-positive and -negative bacteria, actinomycete, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) for microbial community structure. Compared to no cover crop, cover crop overall enhanced PLFA, MBC, and MBN by 24, 40, and 51%, respectively. Soil total bacteria and total fungi, and the groups in them increased by 7-31% with cove crop compared to no cover crop. Fungi were affected more by cover crop than bacteria as indicated by the greater fungi/bacteria ratio. In depth categorical meta-analyses revealed that the legume and nonlegume cover crop mixture reduced MBC, PLFA, and actinomycete compared to legume or nonlegume cover crop alone. Legume cover crop enhanced actinomycete in comparison to nonlegume or the cover crop mixture. Incorporation of cover crop residue into the soil increased PLFA, total bacteria, AMF root colonization, and spore density, but decreased gram-positive and -negative bacteria and AMF compared to residue placed at the surface or removed from the soil. Microbial parameters due to cover crop compared to no cover crop were related to soil properties and annual precipitation. Medium-textured soils showed greater response of cover crop on PLFA, total bacteria and fungi, and actinomycete than fine- or coarse-textured soils. We conclude that cover crops enhance soil microbial community biomass and affected community structure compared to no cover crop and the responses of microbial parameters to cover crop varied with soil and climatic conditions. Cover crops can enhance biological soil health by enhancing microbial community abundance compared to no cover crop.

This study aimed to investigate how cultivars that differ in root traits affect water acquisition and the optimal seeding rate. Three cultivars of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with contrasting root systems (CW134, more roots in topsoil and less roots in subsoil; CH58, small root biomass; CH1, less roots in topsoil and more roots in subsoil) were sown at 180, 225, and 280 seeds m(-2) in 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 in a semiarid farmland on the Loess Plateau of China. As the seeding rate increased, grain yield declined in CW134, with topsoil roots increasing and subsoil roots decreasing in both seasons. In contrast, both grain yield and subsoil roots increased in CH1, and the highest grain yield was produced by CH1 at 280 seeds m(-2) in both seasons. Subsoil root traits had a positive effect on soil water consumption after anthesis, which was strongly affected by yield components in the dryer season (2015-2016). However, the reverse was true for topsoil root traits. In 2014-2015, the topsoil roots had a positive effect on soil water consumption before anthesis, and aboveground traits at anthesis had a greater positive effect on yield components. To maintain higher yields in semiarid environments, genotypes with more topsoil roots should have lower seeding rates to alleviate the negative effect of excessive topsoil roots on postanthesis water absorption, while the reverse may be true for genotypes with more roots in subsoil layers.

A combination of salinity and high P rather than low P is more detrimental to the growth of maize. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which P nutrition modifies the salt tolerance and P uptake of maize. The present study aimed to investigate the combined effects of salinity and P on maize growth and P uptake, and to address the physiological mechanisms of salt tolerance influenced by P availability in maize. Seedlings of a local maize cultivar XY335 were grown hydroponically for 35 days under low (5 mu M) or sufficient P supply (200 mu M) with or without 100 mM NaCl. Root morphological traits, tissue mass density, leaf osmolytes (sugars and proline) accumulation, and Na+/K+ ratio were measured to allow evaluation of the combined effects of salinity and P on maize growth and P uptake. Both P deficiency and salinity markedly reduced the growth of maize. However, P deficiency had a more pronounced effect on shoot growth while salinity affected root growth more prominently. Combined effects of P deficiency and salinity on total root length, root surface area, and average root diameter were similar to that of plants grown under salt stress. The combination of P deficiency and salinity treatments had a more pronounced effect on tissue mass density, leaf proline and soluble sugars compared to individual treatment of either low P or NaCl. When exposed to salt stress, maize plants of sufficient P accumulated greater amount of Na+ than those under P deficit, but similar amounts of K+ were observed between the two P treatments. Salt stress significantly increased shoot P concentration of maize with sufficient P (P < 0.01), but not for P-deficient plants. In sum, shoots and roots of maize exhibited different responses to P deficiency and salinity, with more marked effect of P deficiency on shoots and of salinity on roots. P deficiency improved salt tolerance of maize plants, which was associated with the increase of tissue mass density, accumulation of osmolytes, reduction of Na+ accumulation, and selective absorption of K+ over Na+.

Numerical Study of Shear Stress Distribution Over Sand Ripples Under Terrestrial and Martian Conditions	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Ripples occur on Earth and Mars in a range of sizes. From terrestrial studies, ripple size is known to depend on grain-size frequency, wind duration, wind strength (including stronger winds that can flatten ripples), and fundamental environmental factors that differ between the two planets. Here we use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) experiments to model boundary layer shear stresses applied to aeolian ripple surfaces, to investigate how these stresses might differ between Earth and Mars. CFD experiments used ANSYS Fluent, with inlet wind speeds of 10 and 15m/s for both planetary environments. Ripple profiles for Earth and Mars were developed using saltation and reptation properties modeled by the numerical saltation model COMSALT (Kok & Renno, 2009, ) to develop ripple profiles using the numerical technique of Yizhaq et al. (2004, ). Although the CFD experiments using these inputs could not include the effects of a saltation cloud, results are robust enough to indicate clearly that for similar modeled wind speeds on Earth and Mars, boundary layer shear stress applied to ripple surfaces is greater on Earth under conditions for which sand transport is expected. These results indicate that ripples can grow larger on Mars than on Earth, because for typical Martian wind speeds the shear velocity at the ripple crests is below the fluid threshold. Plain Language Summary Elucidating the origin of many natural patterns on Earth and planetary surfaces is a challenging problem of pattern formation in complex systems. Among these mysterious phenomena are the aeolian sand ripples, which are a common pattern of granular matter on Earth and on Mars. Ripple wavelength on Earth is <30cm, and height is less than 1cm, whereas on Mars they might be much larger both in wavelength and height. On Mars, two sizes of aeolian ripples were observed, small (decimeter scale) impact ripples like those on Earth and large, meter-scale ripples with no terrestrial analog. The large ripples on Mars were detected in orbital images and first visited in situ by the NASA Mars Exploration Rover Spirit at the El Dorado ripple field in Gusev Crater. The existence of very large ripples on Mars lacking exact terrestrial analogues is not fully understood at this time and is still a matter of conjecture and debate. In this study, computational fluid dynamics simulations over simulated sand ripples illustrate the differences in shear stress expected at ripple crests on Earth and Mars under two test flow wind speeds. The distribution of the shear stress over ripple crest is important for predicting the entrainment from the crest, which is one of several possible mechanisms for limiting ripple growth by removing grains from the crest, yet its relative importance on Earth and Mars is not understood. The Martian ripple profile was three times larger in the experiments than the terrestrial ripple profile but still several factors smaller than the largest ripples encountered by Mars rovers. Despite this, shear velocities along Martian ripple crests did not reach the critical velocity where erosion from the crest occurs, while at the crests of the smaller terrestrial ripples, the critical velocity was exceeded at the same test inlet wind speeds. These results indicate that fluid shear stress is a more important factor for controlling ripple size on Earth than on Mars and may help to explain why impact ripples on Mars can grow larger than on Earth. These results are useful for understanding the aeolian processes involved in ripple formation under Martian atmospheric conditions. Further studies are needed to verify this conclusion for more realistic larger Martian ripples and for higher shear velocities.

While this issue is widely explored in aquatic ecosystems, MaP pollution on land has been neglected. In 2019, we conducted a large-scale survey of MaPs in Northwest China in 0-30 cm soil with long-term mulching. Samples of MaP debris were collected from 67 sites across Gansu, east Qinghai, and north Shannxi Provinces. All visible MaP pieces for each site were separated and weighed. The mass of each MaP piece was calibrated by size measured in digital images. The MaP mass averaged 47.2 kg ha(-1), and the number of MaPs averaged 266.2 pieces ha(-1). The mass and number of MaPs varied from site to site. The mean size of MaPs was 19.5 cm2 piece(-1) or 28.0 mg piece(-1). More importantly, the number of small MaP pieces (< 5 and 5-20 cm(2) piece(-1)) accounted for 76.7% of the total number of MaPs detected, and small-sized plastic debris (< 10 and 10-25 mg piece-1) were detected in 70.1% of the sampling sites. The percentage of small fragments increased before 15-year of mulching and then declined. However, the amount of medium-large debris (20-50 and > 50 cm(2) piece(-1)) showed a trend opposite to that of small fragments. The percentage of MaPs was greater in the small size group than in the medium-large size group. The arid to semi-arid area exhibited higher MaP contamination compared with the semi-arid to the semi-humid area. These observations indicate that plastic debris residing in soil tend to be fragmented, making plastic film recovery more challenging and causing severe soil pollution. Further studies are required to regulate plastic mulch methods and explore the degradation process.					wang, shuying/HHZ-4516-2022; Li, Shangzhong/HHD-1335-2022														0048-9697	1879-1026				JUL 20	2022	831								154881	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154881		APR 2022						35364156					WOS:000793421200004

In this study, a kind of novel 3D porous carbon material (3D-PCM) was prepared using glucose and urea via two-stage-hydrothermal and activation method for Cr(VI) removal in wastewater. The SEM demonstrate that 3D-PCM has a developed pore structure, and BET test shows that its specific surface area reaches 1554.77 m(2)/g. Batch adsorption experiments showed that the best pH is about 2.0 The Cr(VI) adsorption process on 3D-PCM follows pseudo-second-order kinetics and Freundlich model, and the maximum adsorption capacity reaches 837.19-951.65 mg/g (25-45 degrees C), which is higher than those of similar adsorbents in the world. Through the combination of chemical characterization and adsorption model analysis indicate that the main adsorption mechanisms on 3D-PCM include electrostatic interactions, ion complexation, physical adsorption, reduction and hydrogen bonding. Moreover, the multi-ion competitive simulation and adsorption and regeneration experiments showed that 3D-PCM has excellent selectivity and regenerative performance for Cr(VI) adsorption. Economic analysis shows that the manufacturing cost of 3D-PCM is low. Therefore, 3D-PCM is an effective and reusable material for Cr(VI) removal, and its preparation method is green and sustainable, which is expected to improve the problem of Cr(VI) pollution in water.

Allan; Koren, Lee			Sex differences in testosterone reactivity and sensitivity in a non-model gerbil	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY												-Although testosterone (T) is a key regulator in vertebrate development, physiology, and behaviour in both sexes, studies suggest that its regulation may be sex-specific. We measured circulating T levels in Baluchistan gerbils (Gerbilles nanus) in the field and in the lab all year round and found no significant sex differences. However, we observed sex differences in circulating T levels following gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) challenge and T implants in this non-model species. Whereas only males elevated T following a GnRH challenge, females had higher serum T concentrations following T implant insertion. These differences may be a result of different points of regulation along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Consequently, we examined sex differences in the mRNA expression of the androgen receptor (AR) in multiple brain regions. We identified AR and I3-actin sequences in assembled genomic sequences of members of the Gerbillinae, which were analogous to rat sequences, and designed primers for them. The distribution of the AR in G. nanus brain regions was similar to documented expression profiles in rodents. We found lower AR mRNA levels in females in the striatum. Additionally, G. nanus that experienced housing in mixed-sex pairs had higher adrenal AR expression than G. nanus that were housed alone. Regulation of the gerbil HPG axis may reflect evolutionary sex differences in lifehistory strategies, with males ready to reproduce when receptive females are available, while the possible reproductive costs associated with female T direct its regulation upstream.

Their spatial redistribution pattern is governed by the transport distances of individual displaced soil particles, which is not only dependent on their settling velocity, but also affected by slope topography. However, the potential impacts of fine-scale variation of slope topography on the erosion-induced lateral and carbon fluxes are often over-generalized by coarse digital elevation models. Material and methods: In this study, two topo-sequences, convex and concave, over a long gentle slope in the northeast China were investigated. Surface soils were sampled at predetermined space intervals from upslope to downslope along the two toposequences, and then fractionated by the settling velocity of individual fractions into four classes: > 250, 63 - 250, 20 - 63 and < 20 mu m. The soil organic carbon (SOC) and delta(13) C of the unfractionated soils and all the settling classes were measured, and their CO2 emission rates were also determined at six temperature gradients: 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Results and disucssion: Our results show that: 1) The soil fractions along the upper lying convex segment showed a coarsening effect toward the knee point and then a fining trend at the slope toe, whilst the soil compositions along the lower lying concave segment stayed fairly comparable as the slope descended. 2) The net loss of surface soil along the eroding convex segment resulted in depleted SOC and more positive delta(13) C signatures than that along the depositional concave segment. 3) The CO2 emission rates of almost all the settling fractions were enhanced compared with that of the unfractionated soil, and the settling class-specific CO2 emission rates and their temperature sensitivity (Q(10) ) also differed along the two topo-sequences. Conclusions: This demonstrates that fine scale topographic variations had a strong control over the lateral and vertical carbon fluxes, which has been often disguised by coarse grid size in digital elevation models or average sediment delivery ratios. Topography-dependency must be properly accounted for when calculating slope-scale carbon balances.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				APR	2020	20	4					1906	1919		10.1007/s11368-020-02575-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-020-02575-6		FEB 2020											WOS:000516309600001

Amelioration of a saline-alkaline soil using biochar and compost: Impacts on plant growth, soil biological and chemical characteristics	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Land degradation reduces productivity and biodiversity, and requires restoration of both soil condition and vegetation to re-establish ecosystem services. Organic amendments can improve soil biological and chemical properties, thereby enhancing revegetation success in severely degraded soil. This study investigated the use of compost and biochar to support revegetation and soil restoration. Soil was collected from a severely degraded creek bed in an agricultural farm in south-western Australia (UWA Farm Ridgefield) and amended with compost (2.5% and 5%) and biochar (5% and 10%), both alone and in all pairwise combinations. Saltbush (Atriplex nummularia) seedlings were grown for 10 weeks in glasshouse conditions. Following harvest, plant growth and soil chemical properties were analysed. DNA was extracted from rhizosphere soil for bacterial diversity profiling with subsequent putative functional genes relating to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling using an in-silico approach. Compost improved growth of root and shoot biomass. Both compost and biochar improved the alkaline soil by reducing pH and increasing nitrate, phosphorus and potassium levels. Compost addition also had a significant effect on rhizosphere bacterial community structure, decreasing alpha diversity and altering beta diversity indices. Amendment of soil also changed the relative abundance of putative nutrient cycling genes, with an increase in the potential for denitrification, carbon and phosphorus cycling and a decrease in ammonification potential. Application of this compost-biochar combination improved plant growth and soil condition by altering both chemical and biological characteristics of the soil, and therefore may provide an effective management strategy for supporting restoration in a degraded landscape.

Oil and gas exploration and development in the Lake Eyre Basin: distribution and consequences for rivers and wetlands, including the Coongie Lakes Ramsar Site	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Context Altered flooding regimes and pollution threaten the world's wetlands, including floodplains of the largely free-flowing rivers. Aims We investigated the distribution of current and future oil and gas production and exploration on the floodplains of the Lake Eyre Basin. Methods We compiled these data and their associated infrastructure across the basin floodplains, including the Coongie Lakes Ramsar Site. Key results There were 831 oil and gas wells across the Lake Eyre Basin, predominantly (98.6%) on Cooper Creek floodplains, with 296 wells in the Coongie Lakes Ramsar Site, with 281 well pads, roads (870 km) and 440 storages. Only eight referrals occurred under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, despite potential Ramsar wetland impacts. Future oil and gas production licences, primarily unconventional gas production, covered similar to 2.91 x 10(6) ha (Cooper Creek), 0.63 x 10(6) ha (Diamantina) and 1.03 x 10(6) ha (Georgina) of the floodplains. Conclusions and implications Oil and gas production and exploration disrupt flooding regimes, with pollution (spills and greenhouse gas emissions).

Identifying management-driven dynamics in vegetation cover: Applying the <i>Compere</i> framework to Cooper Creek, Australia	ECOSPHERE												The observed spatial and temporal dynamics in landscape and ecosystem resources are the net effects of natural processes and management activities. Monitoring the impact that humans have on these resources requires that these two sources of variability be partitioned, removing the natural variability to reveal variability due to management activities. Here, we present Compere, a relative benchmarking framework for monitoring the management-driven impacts on ecosystem resources. The framework identifies locations in a region that share similar biophysical properties to a target location. Taking an attribute of interest, it then compares the value of the target location with those of all its biophysically equivalent locations, with any differences being attributed to variations in management. We provide an example application of Compere, using satellite-derived vegetation cover data to examine the impact of hydrocarbon extraction activities on land condition (as described by vegetation cover) across the 490,000-km(2) Cooper Creek region in arid central Australia. Validation was performed by comparing land condition estimates to known disturbance patterns across the region. We found that the establishment of well sites was associated with between 12% and 41% decreases in land condition but that condition recovered to original levels by 6 years after establishment. We also found that fires had much larger and longer lasting effects on land condition across these landscapes, indicating that mining-related activities that change fire patterns are likely to affect land condition most. Compere is a generic, flexible framework, providing a new capability for monitoring management impacts on multiple types of ecosystem resources.

Stem rot disease caused by Sclerotium rolfsii is the most devastating disease of groundnut and can cause up to 100% yield loss. Genomic-assisted breeding (GAB) has potential for accelerated development of stem rot resistance varieties in short period with more precision. In this context, linkage analysis and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping for resistance to stem rot disease was performed in a bi-parental recombinant inbred line population developed from TG37A (susceptible)xNRCG-CS85 (resistant) comprising of 270 individuals. Genotyping-by-sequencing approach was deployed to generate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data leading to development of a genetic map with 585 SNP loci spanning map distance of 2430cM. QTL analysis using multi-season phenotyping and genotyping data could not detect any major main-effect QTL but identified 44 major epistatic QTLs with phenotypic variation explained ranging from 14.32 to 67.95%. Large number interactions indicate the complexity of genetic architecture of resistance to stem rot disease. A QTL of physical map length 5.2Mb identified on B04 comprising 170 different genes especially leucine reach repeats, zinc finger motifs and ethyleneresponsive factors, etc., was identified. The identified genomic regions and candidate genes will further validate and facilitate marker development to deploy GAB for developing stem rot disease resistance groundnut varieties.

Straw incorporation and/or adding organic fertilizer can enhance wheat productivity by improving the soil water content (SWC) and soil fertility, but systematic long-term research has not yet been conducted. Thus, we conducted a 12-year continuous in-situ experiment in the Loess Plateau by testing four treatments: specialIntscript CK: no fertilization and wheat straw removal; specialIntscript FM: straw removal and application of inorganic fertilizer; specialIntscript SI: straw incorporation and application of inorganic fertilizer; specialIntscript SIOM: straw incorporation and application of inorganic fertilizer, with organic fertilizer added to replace 10% of the inorganic fertilizer. Under CK, the soil chemical properties and enzyme activities tended to decrease over the years. The soil fertility was significantly higher under FM than CK, and higher under SI and SIOM than FM (P < 0.05). SIOM significantly improved the soil nutrients and wheat productivity than other treatments (P < 0.05). Compared with FM, the soil bulk density in the 0-20 cm soil layer under SIOM decreased by 4.5%, while SOC, TN, TP, AN, and Olsen-P increased by 4.5%, 6.1%, 4.9%, and 12.3%, respectively. The DOC, DON, MBC, and MBN contents increased by 18.5%, 26.4%, 15.8%, and 16.2%, respectively. The activities of urease, sucrase, and catalase increased by 12.8%, 13.6%, and 22.8%, and the N uptake, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), water use efficiency (WUE), water productivity, and wheat yield increased by 17.8%, 43.7%, 38.6%, 33.5%, and 22.4%. SIOM obtained the highest NUE, WUE, yield, and economic benefits of 37.83%, 14.34 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) , 4579.16 kg ha(-1) , and 7990.39 Yuan ha(-1) , respectively. Linear mixed effects modeling showed that the year and treatment significantly affected the soil fertility and wheat productivity (P < 0.05). Random forest and structural equation modeling showed that the soil and fertilizer management strategies increased wheat productivity (R-2 symbolscript 0.50) by improving the soil fertility. Therefore, straw incorporation and applying inorganic/organic fertilizers are effective management strategies for improving soil fertility and wheat productivity in semi-arid areas of Loess Plateau regions.																			1161-0301	1873-7331				NOV	2023	151								126986	10.1016/j.eja.2023.126986	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2023.126986		SEP 2023											WOS:001084896600001

Study participants were randomly selected for survey and focus group discussions, while key informant traditional healers were identified through snowball/chain-referral sampling. The informant consensus factor (FIC) by ailment category and fidelity level (FL) for some MPs were determined. About 97 MP species were identified. Leaves, roots, and seeds are the parts predominantly used for phytomedication preparation to treat 30 human and 5 animal diseases. Diseases, such as epilepsy, arthritis, otitis media, and fever, are treated with a combination of 2-4 MPs. The FIC value ranged from 0.29-1.00, with most human diseases showing an FIC value of above 0.7. The FL value for the MPs ranged from 53-100%, with plants used to treat more than one disease tending to have lower FL values. Higher values of FIC and FL indicate high levels of traditional knowledge used to identify and administer medicinal preparations. Despite the frequent use of MPs, the four-cell analysis showed that most of them risk extinction due anthropogenic and climate factors. We recommend botanical gardens as a solution to sustainable conservation, study, education and a source for these declining MP species.

However, the nonlinear dynamics and influencing factors operating at various time scales are not yet fully understood. Here, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method was used to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of NPP and its association with hydrothermal factors and anthropogenic activities across different temporal scales for the Yellow River Basin (YRB) from 2000 to 2020. The results indicate that: (1) the annual average NPP was 236.37 g C/m(2) in the YRB and increased at rates of 4.64 g C/m(2)/a(1) (R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.01) during 2000 to 2020. Spatially, nonlinear analysis indicates that 72.77% of the study area exhibits a predominantly increasing trend in NPP, while 25.17% exhibits a reversing trend. (2) On a 3-year time scale, warming has resulted in an increase in NPP in the majority of areas of the study area (69.49%). As the time scale widens, the response of vegetation to climate change becomes more prominent; especially under the long-term trend, the percentage areas of the correlation between vegetation and precipitation and temperature increased with significance, reaching 48.21% and 11.57%, respectively. (3) Through comprehensive time analysis and multivariate regression analysis, it was confirmed that both human activities and climate factors had comparable impacts on vegetation growth. Among different vegetation types, climate was still the main factor affecting grassland NPP, and only 15.74% of grassland was affected by human activities. For shrubland, forest, and farmland, human activity was a dominating factor for vegetation NPP change. There are still few studies on vegetation change using nonlinear methods in the Yellow River Basin, and most studies have not considered the effect of time scale on vegetation evolution. The findings highlight the significance of multi-time scale analysis in understanding the vegetation dynamics and providing scientific guidance for future vegetation restoration and conservation efforts.																				2072-4292				NOV	2023	15	22							5273	10.3390/rs15225273	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15225273													WOS:001114603600001

The Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative (IFFCO) developed nano-urea (nano-N), nano-zinc (nano-Zn), and nano-copper (nano-Cu) liquid fertilizer formulations to enhance the crop yields, simultaneously addressing the nutrient deficiency, without causing toxicity. Therefore, this study was formulated to evaluate the effectiveness of nano-N (nano-urea), nano-Zn, and nano-Cu at varying N levels [0, 50, 75, and 100% of the recommended rates of nitrogen (RRN)] on maize-wheat and pearl millet-mustard systems during 2019-20 and 2020-21. The results exhibited that the application of nano-N + nano-Zn with 100% RRN exhibited significantly higher grain yields in maize (66.2-68.8%), wheat (62.6-61.9%), pearl millet (57.1-65.4%), and mustard (47.2-69.0%), respectively, over absolute control plots and combinations of three nano-fertilizers like nano-N + nano-Zn + nano-Cu applied plots. This was mainly attributed to the higher N and Zn uptake by the crops. However, 75% RRN with nano-N + nano-Zn also produced comparable yields. Thus, applying nano-N and nano-Zn via foliar applications, in conjunction with conventional urea, has the potential to reduce the required nitrogen fertilizer amount by up to 25%, while simultaneously maintaining equivalent yield levels. Similarly, 100% RRN and 75% RRN + nano-N + nano-Zn registered comparable profitability, soil mineral N, dehydrogenase activity (DHA), and soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC), during both the study years. However, further research and field trials on nano fertilizers alone or in combination with conventional fertilizers are essential to fully unlock its benefits and ascertain its long-term effects which may offer a pathway to more efficient and eco-friendly crop nourishment.

J	Liu, X; Xu, YY				Liu, Xian; Xu, Yueyue			Analysis of Dynamic Changes and Main Obstacle Factors of Grain Supply and Demand Balance in Northwest China	SUSTAINABILITY												It is of great significance to systematically analyze the characteristics of the regional grain supply and demand balance, reveal the influence mechanism of crop sustainable development, and put forward effective countermeasures to achieve the goal of food security. This paper aims at addressing the unique geographical characteristics of Northwest China and the current lack of research on its food security. This paper systematically analyzes the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of the regional grain production, consumption and food security level. The main factors affecting regional food security are examined, and we put forward effective suggestions to promote regional sustainable production. The results show that the average annual growth rate of grain production in Northwest China from 2000 to 2021 was 3.4%, and the years of increased grain production accounted for 77.3%. The main reason for the increase in grain production was the increase in yield per unit area (average annual growth of 2.8%), of which the rice yield was the largest, up to 7.3 t/ha. Maize and wheat accounted for 60.7% and 23.4% of the total grain production in the region, respectively. From the perspective of the regional structure, Inner Mongolia contributed the most to the grain production in the region, accounting for 33.5% of the total output. Xinjiang, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia and Qinghai contributed 17.1%, 15.4%, 15.2%, 13.0%, 4.5% and 1.3%, respectively, to grain production. From the perspective of the dietary structure, the grain consumption pattern in Northwest China has gradually changed from raw grains to animal products, which has undoubtedly increased the regional demand for grain. At present, since the increase in output is greater than the demand for food, the food self-sufficiency rate in the region has increased from 0.81 to 1.28. Since the grain yield per unit area in Xinjiang and Ningxia has a relative advantage over other provinces, to achieve regional food security for a long time, moderately increasing the grain planting area in these two provinces will help to promote regional food security. In addition, as the grains produced in the region are mainly wheat and corn, the yield level of wheat and corn in Xinjiang and Qinghai has a comparative advantage within Northwest China. Therefore, moderately increasing the planting area of wheat and corn in Xinjiang and Qinghai is of great significance in ensuring regional food security. The research results can provide theoretical support for the realization of regional food security and provide a reference for other regions in the world, to better serve global food security.																				2071-1050				JUL	2023	15	14							10835	10.3390/su151410835	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151410835													WOS:001038763500001

Dynamic delineation of management zones for site-specific nitrogen fertilization in a citrus orchard	PRECISION AGRICULTURE												Estimating crop nitrogen status to optimize production and minimize environmental pollution is a major challenge for modern agriculture. The study objective was to develop a multivariate spatiotemporal dynamic clustering approach to generate Nitrogen (N) Management Zones (MZs) in a citrus orchard during the growing season. The research was conducted in four citrus plots in the coastal area of Israel. Five variables were selected to characterize each plot's spatiotemporal variability of canopy N content. These were split into constant (i.e., elevation, northness, and slope) and non-constant (i.e., canopy N content and tree height) variables. The non-constant data were obtained via bi-monthly imaging campaigns with a multispectral camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) throughout the growing season of 2019. The selected variables were then standardized to define the clusters by applying the Getis-Ord Gi* z-score. These were used to develop a spatiotemporal dynamic clustering model using Fuzzy C-means (FCM). Four input variables were investigated in this final stage, including the constant variables only and different combinations of constant and non-constant variables. The support vector machine regression model results for estimating canopy N-content from multispectral images were R-2 = 0.771 and RMSE = 0.227. This model was used to predict monthly canopy-level N content and classify the N content levels based on the October N-to-yield content envelope curve. Delineating MZs was followed by the comparison of spatial association among cluster maps. This process may support site-specific and time-specific nitrogen management.

However, the lack of adequate storage facilities results in significant losses of sesame seeds. This study was designed to compare the effects of storage conditions and the subsequent impact on sesame seed germination, mold growth, and mycotoxin accumulation over the storage period. The efficacy of two hermetic bags (1. Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags and 2. Super GrainPro (SGP) bags) was directly compared to sesame storage in polypropylene (PP bags) and Jute bags. Storage conditions (oxygen, carbon dioxide, temperature, moisture content and relative humidity) of samples were analyzed in the laboratory in three replicates. Results showed that the oxygen concentrations dropped to 6.9% (+/- 0.02) in PICS bags and 8.7% (+/- 0.06) in SGP bags at the end of 6 months of storage. In non-hermetic bags Jute and PP), oxygen levels were close to atmospheric levels at 2-, 4-, and 6-month storage periods. In non-hermetic bags throughout storage, the amount of seed infection by mold constantly increased, and seed germination decreased. Sesame seeds stored in hermetic bags had 89.7% (+/- 0.58) to 88.3% (+/- 2.89) germination rates versus 61.67% (+/- 2.08) for non-hermetic storage bags over the 6-month seed storage period. All mycotoxin levels increased over the same storage period, whereas comparative levels were much lower in hermetic bags after six months. Sesame seeds stored in both hermetic bags had the lowest level of tested mycotoxins, and levels among the SGP and PICS bags were not significantly different from one another. This study provides strong evidence indicating that hermetic storage structures such as PICS and SGP significantly affect temperature, humidity, moisture content, CO2 and oxygen levels resulting in the lowering of fungal growth and mycotoxin accumulation and effectively preserving stored sesame without relying on synthetic pesticides in Ethiopia.

J	Wang, JW; Zhang, KD; Li, P; Meng, Y; Zhao, LY				Wang, Jingwen; Zhang, Kuandi; Li, Pu; Meng, Yu; Zhao, Luyou			Hydrodynamic characteristics and evolution law of roll waves in overland flow	CATENA												The frequent occurrence of roll waves in overland flow can increase the water depth and accelerate sheet erosion. To investigate the variation laws and hydrodynamic characteristics of roll waves, indoor artificial experiments with five roughness types, seventeen flow discharges, and five slope gradients were conducted in a hydraulic flume. The results showed that the evolution process of roll waves is divided into three phases: monochromatic, quasi-sine, and mature wave regions. In addition, the parameter roll-wave velocity increased in terms of its power function with the unit discharges, while the slopes showed that a positive line was related to this increase. An empirical formula of the wave velocity was obtained by conducting a regression analysis after synthesizing the influencing factors. The wavelength varied at a single peak with increasing unit discharges, showing a negative linear correlation with the test slope. Additionally, an empirical formula of the wavelength was derived using regression methods. The correction coefficients in the laminar flow instability zone varied from 0.27 to 0.39, while the Reynolds number was approximately 100. The critical average Freud number Fr and the Onsager value Z were 0.6 and 3.33 x 10(-3), respectively. In addition, the correction coefficients in the turbulent flow instability zone varied within 0.412-0.730, while the Reynolds number fluctuated between 900 and 3300. The range of the critical Fr value was 1.59-2.20, and the critical average Z was 1.88 x 10(-3). These results are vital for understanding the hydrodynamic characteristics and evolution laws of roll waves in overland flow.					wang, dan/JEF-0836-2023; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022; wang, jie/HTQ-4920-2023; wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023; wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; wang, jian/HRB-9588-2023; wang, juan/IUO-6218-2023; wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; wang, jing/HJA-5384-2022; wang, jiajun/JRW-6032-2023	Zhang, Kuandi/0000-0002-1745-8435													0341-8162	1872-6887				MAR	2021	198								105068	10.1016/j.catena.2020.105068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.105068													WOS:000605337000032

The morphology and electrochemical properties of NiO@CFC and NiO/MnO2@CFC composites were characterised, and the electrochemical properties of the electrode materials prepared under different feeding qualities and microwave conditions were compared. NiO/MnO2@CFC showed a high specific capacitance of 188.3 mAh/g at a current density of 1 A/g and excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 88.4% after 2000 cycles); these results indicate that the MnO2 nanoparticles improve the cycling stability of CFC-supported NiO supercapacitors (37.8% capacitance loss after 1000 cycles). An asymmetric NiO/MnO2@CFC supercapacitor revealed a competitive energy density of 20.87 Wh/kg at a power density of 850 W/kg.

This study aimed at quantifying the GE interaction effects and determines grain yield stability among winter bread wheat genotypes under rainfed conditions of Iran. Twenty-four winter wheat genotypes were evaluated under nine test locations using a randomized complete blocks design with four replications during three cropping seasons (2019-21). The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model and several parametric and nonparametric stability statistics were applied for analysis of grain yield data collected from the experiments. AMMI analysis of variance for grain yield revealed significant effects (p < 0.01) for genotype, environment, and GE interaction. The environment was the main source of variation and accounted for 83.5% of the total yield variation, followed by GE (6.5%) and genotype (1.0%) effects. The AMMI biplot analysis indicated the genotypes G3, G23, G22, G10, and G19 as high yielding with stability performance across environments. Genotypes G14, G13, G20, and G9 showed large positive interaction with the environments featuring the highest rainfall during growing season, while genotypes G7, G6, and G21 had a large positive interaction with environments with low rainfall. Spearman's rank correlation analysis revealed that the AMMI stability value, Shukla's stability variance (sigma(2) (i)), Wricke's ecovalence (W-2 (i)), coefficient of determination (R-2 (i)), variance in regression deviations (S-2 (di)), and nonparametric statistic of S-2 ((i)) were not correlated with mean yield in tested genotypes, showing they are related to static/biological concept of stability. In contrast, the genotypic superiority index (Pi) and regression coefficient (bi) were significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with mean yield and corresponded to dynamic/agronomic concept of stability. These findings suggest that selection of genotypes should be considered based on selection objectives of using the various stability parameters described here. In conclusion, the selected genotypes in this study should be recommended as new cultivars or parental lines for grain yield and stability improvement under rainfed conditions of Iran or similar agro-ecologies.					jafarzadeh, jafar/C-9502-2019; Mohammadi, Reza/S-2543-2016; rajabi, rahman/A-3360-2017; Mohammadi, Reza/Q-8194-2019	jafarzadeh, jafar/0000-0001-6423-4082; Mohammadi, Reza/0000-0001-7694-0849													0014-4797	1469-4441				OCT 6	2022	58								e37	10.1017/S0014479722000345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0014479722000345													WOS:000864126200001

We examined how three ontogenetic stages of a locally endangered tree species, Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata, responded to environmental factors and human disturbance in Hugumburda dry Afromontane forest in Ethiopia. We counted individual seedlings, saplings and adults of O. europaea in 70 20 x 20 m quadrats over ca. 2.8 ha, and measured biotic (woody species richness, canopy cover, aboveground tree biomass, herbaceous cover), abiotic (soil and topographic variables), and human disturbance factors (logging and tracks). To detect ontogenetic niche shifts, we compared observed vs. simulated locations of trees in the three life stages and how they related to the environmental and human disturbance factors. We found that the population structure of O. europaea showed generally low recruitment, with few seedlings per hectare compared with the abundance of saplings and adults. The probability of finding O. europaea individuals was influenced by biotic (woody species richness) and abiotic (soil depth, slope) environmental conditions and human disturbance (logging intensity), but the direction, strength and shape of the relationships differed between seedling, sapling and adult life stages, indicating ontogenetic niche shifts. All life stages showed a positive relationship with elevation. The observed environmental niches of the different lifestages of O. europaea, and their association with human disturbance levels, should be considered when conservation strategies are developed for this species. Human disturbance in terms of logging decreases the abundance of saplings, but may facilitate emerging seedlings through creation of gaps with improved light conditions. Recruitment is, however, very low in the study area, and seedlings should be protected from browsing to enhance survival. Woody species richness in general should be conserved to optimize conditions also for O. europaea saplings.						, Kari/0000-0003-1049-7025; Eldegard, Katrine/0000-0002-3276-8087													1932-6203					SEP 30	2021	16	9							e0256843	10.1371/journal.pone.0256843	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256843								34591856					WOS:000743903000009

Genome-wide analysis of epigenetic and transcriptional changes associated with heterosis in pigeonpea	PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL												Hybrids are extensively used in agriculture to deliver an increase in yield, yet the molecular basis of heterosis is not well understood. Global DNA methylation analysis, transcriptome analysis and small RNA profiling were aimed to understand the epigenetic effect of the changes in gene expression level in the two hybrids and their parental lines. Increased DNA methylation was observed in both the hybrids as compared to their parents. This increased DNA methylation in hybrids showed that majority of the 24-nt siRNA clusters had higher expression in hybrids than the parents. Transcriptome analysis revealed that various phytohormones (auxin and salicylic acid) responsive hybrid-MPV DEGs were significantly altered in both the hybrids in comparison to MPV. DEGs associated with plant immunity and growth were overexpressed whereas DEGs associated with basal defence level were repressed. This antagonistic patterns of gene expression might contribute to the greater growth of the hybrids. It was also noticed that some common as well as unique changes in the regulatory pathways were associated with heterotic growth in both the hybrids. Approximately 70% and 67% of down-regulated hybrid-MPV DEGs were found to be differentially methylated in ICPH 2671 and ICPH 2740 hybrid, respectively. This reflected the association of epigenetic regulation in altered gene expressions. Our findings also revealed that miRNAs might play important roles in hybrid vigour in both the hybrids by regulating their target genes, especially in controlling plant growth and development, defence and stress response pathways. The above finding provides an insight into the molecular mechanism of pigeonpea heterosis.					xun, xu/JGM-9272-2023; Varshney, Rajeev K/C-5295-2014; Garg, Vanika/AFE-2782-2022; Liu, Xin/ABJ-9485-2022; Singh, Vikas/JGL-8643-2023; Khan, Mohammad Aamir Waseem/AAP-1262-2021	Varshney, Rajeev K/0000-0002-4562-9131; Garg, Vanika/0000-0001-6446-4603; Liu, Xin/0000-0003-3256-2940; Khan, Mohammad Aamir Waseem/0000-0001-9734-8123; Powell, Wayne/0000-0002-5612-3398; sinha, Pallavi/0000-0003-0810-0711; Singh, Vikas Kumar/0000-0002-1560-1648; Searle, Iain/0000-0003-4306-9756; Kale, Sandip/0000-0003-0665-5094													1467-7644	1467-7652				AUG	2020	18	8					1697	1710		10.1111/pbi.13333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.13333		FEB 2020						31925873					WOS:000510559600001

However, how soil microbial metabolic limitation responds to cropland revegetation in erosion and deposition landscapes remains poorly understood, which has substantial implications for carbon (C) retention and nutrient cycling in the eroding environment.MethodsWe sampled 0-2 m soils in cropland and revegetated forest and grassland at upslopes and check dams in the hilly-gully region of the Loess Plateau, China. The activities of soil C-, nitrogen (N)-, and phosphorus (P)-acquiring enzymes were analyzed. The improved enzyme vector model (V-T model) based on balance points was used to quantify microbial metabolic limitations based on ecoenzymatic stoichiometry.ResultsMicroorganisms suffered from no energy (C) limitation, but the relative microbial C limitation was greater in revegetated forest than in cropland. At upslopes, the revegetated forest was primarily limited by P, while the revegetated grassland and cropland were limited by N, which was indicated by the VTN/P limitation values of 4.35, -2.74, and - 1.87, respectively. Microbial P limitation was greater in deep soils of revegetated forest due to the assimilation of P by the root system. At check dams, land-use change had no significant influence on microbial N/P limitations owing to abundant soil C and nutrients and a wet environment.ConclusionConcludingly, cropland revegetation had a weaker influence on microbial metabolic limitation at the lower-lying topography, which compensates for the current understanding of resource restrictions on microorganisms at slopes or flat areas.

The aim of this study was to model the determinant factors of land cover changes in Raya Valley, Southern Tigray, Ethiopia. Multistage sampling was used to collect data from 246 households sampled from lowlands (47), midlands (104), highlands (93), and sub-alpine (2) agro-climatological zone. Descriptive statistics and logit regression model were used to analyze the field survey data. Agricultural land expansion, fuelwood extraction, deforestation, overgrazing and expansion of infrastructure were the proximate causes of LULCC in the study area. Agricultural land expansion (p = 0.084) and wood extraction for fuel and charcoal production (p = 0.01) were the prominent causes for LULCC. Persistent drought (p = 0.001), rapid population growth (p = 0.027), and climate variability (p = 0.013) were the underlying driving factors of LULCC. The determinants of LULCC need to be considered and mitigated to draw robust land use policy for sustainable land management by the smallholder farmers. This study provides important results for designing and implementing scientific land management strategies by policy makers and land managers.

J	Tang, SQ; She, DL; Wang, HD				Tang, Shengqiang; She, Dongli; Wang, Hongde			Effect of salinity on soil structure and soil hydraulic characteristics	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Revealing the influences of soil salinity on soil structure and hydraulic properties contributes to understanding the mechanism of salinity restraining rehabilitation of saline sodic soil in coastal area. After being passed through a 1 mm sieve, silt loam and silty clay were irrigated with saline water to achieve different soil salinities to highlight the effect of irrigation salinity on aggregate formation from primary particles. Three irrigation events with different saline water were conducted in the same 2 mo interval in soil columns; the soil columns were subjected to natural evaporation during the interval. The soil salinity, soil structure, soil-water characteristic curve, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) results were determined after the end of the third drying subprocess. The results showed that the proportion of water-stable macroaggregates (0.25-2 mm) in the silt loam and silty clay increased as the soil salt content (SSC) increased. Under the same matric suction, the retention capacity and plant-available water capacity (PAWC) of the silt loam first increased and then decreased, with the SSC increasing to a maximum of approximately 14.5 g kg(-1). The retention capacity of the silty clay increased with the SSC, whereas the PAWC decreased with the SSC. The K-s of the silt loam increased with SSC. This study reveals the effects of soil salinity on aggregate formation from primary particles in wetting-drying cycles and describes the corresponding changes in hydraulic properties, which influence the rehabilitation of saline sodic soils in coastal areas.																			0008-4271	1918-1841				MAR	2021	101	1					62	73		10.1139/cjss-2020-0018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2020-0018													WOS:000626319200006

The model was calibrated and validated for popular wheat variety HD-2967 under semi-arid environmental conditions. The important genetic coefficients were generated and model fine-tuned for simulating phenology, leaf area index (LAI), dry matter and yield of wheat crop. The result showed that the model simulated the phenology in terms of days to 50% anthesis and days to physiological maturity very accurately with root mean squared error of 2.26 and 1.36 days, respectively. The model could also able to simulate temporal course of LAI and biomass very satisfactorily. The errors in simulating final biomass and yield were also within the acceptable limit of 10%. We conclude that InfoCrop model is reasonably suitable to simulate the developmental stages, leaf area expansion, dry matter and yield of wheat crop in semi-arid environment hence it can be utilized for undertaking various crop management applications.

Superior haplotypes for haplotype-based breeding for drought tolerance in pigeonpea (<i>Cajanus cajan</i>L.)	PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL												Haplotype-based breeding, a recent promising breeding approach to develop tailor-made crop varieties, deals with identification of superior haplotypes and their deployment in breeding programmes. In this context, whole genome re-sequencing data of 292 genotypes from pigeonpea reference set were mined to identify the superior haplotypes for 10 drought-responsive candidate genes. A total of 83, 132 and 60 haplotypes were identified in breeding lines, landraces and wild species, respectively. Candidate gene-based association analysis of these 10 genes on a subset of 137 accessions of the pigeonpea reference set revealed 23 strong marker-trait associations (MTAs) in five genes influencing seven drought-responsive component traits.Haplo-phenoanalysis for the strongly associated genes resulted in the identification of most promising haplotypes for three genes regulating five component drought traits. The haplotypeC. cajan_23080-H2 for plant weight (PW), fresh weight (FW) and turgid weight (TW), the haplotypeC. cajan_30211-H6 for PW, FW, TW and dry weight (DW), the haplotypeC. cajan_26230-H11 for FW and DW and the haplotypeC. cajan_26230-H5 for relative water content (RWC) were identified as superior haplotypes under drought stress condition. Furthermore, 17 accessions containing superior haplotypes for three drought-responsive genes were identified. The identified superior haplotypes and the accessions carrying these superior haplotypes will be very useful for deployinghaplotype-based breedingto develop next-generation tailor-made better drought-responsive pigeonpea cultivars.

However, under rapid anthropogenic fragmentation, the evolution of dispersal may be limited, and species may be unable to adequately adapt to fragmented landscapes. Here, we develop a spatially explicit model to investigate the evolution of dispersal kernels under various combinations of fragmentation dynamics and initial conditions. We also study the consequences of modelling an evolutionary process in which dispersal phenotypes continuously and gradually shift in phenotype space in a manner corresponding to a polygenic underlying genetic architecture. With rapid fragmentation rates, we observed the emergence of long-term transient states in which dispersal strategies are not well suited to fragmented landscapes. We also show that the extent and length of these transient states depend on the pre-fragmentation dispersal strategy of the species, as well as on the rate of the fragmentation process leading to the fragmented landscape. In an increasingly fragmented world, understanding the ability of populations to adapt, and the effects that rapid fragmentation has on the evolution of dispersal, is critical for an informed assessment of species viability in the Anthropocene.

Considering the potential degradation of Pinus sylvestris var mongolica (P. sylvestris) plantations in the Mu Us sandy land, there is still a knowledge gap regarding the selection of suitable sand-adapted species for mixed planting with P. sylvestris to enhance plantation productivity. To this end, we constructed a mixed planting system of two species, including P. sylvestris and six other adaptive species, in the Mu Us sandy land. Through the identification of potential allelochemicals in the root exudates of P. sylvestris and a series of greenhouse experiments, we clarified the effects of the root systems and exudates of P. sylvestris on the performance of adaptive species. The results showed that a total of 1062 root exudates of P. sylvestris were detected, including abundant potential allelochemicals such as fatty acids, phenolic acids, terpenes, flavonoids, and coumarins. Rhizobox experiments showed that the above-and belowground biomasses of Amorpha fruticosa Linn (A. fruticosa) and P. sylvestris were significantly and positively influenced by the presence of each other. Through different levels of belowground segregation, only A. fruticosa was positively affected by root contact with P. sylvestris, while the other plants were not affected or inhibited. In addition, relatively low concentrations of root exudates of P. sylvestris promoted A. fruticosa performance. Overall, A. fruticosa was positively affected by the root system of P. sylvestris and its exudates, and it promoted the growth of P. sylvestris; therefore, it is suitable for mixed-species planting to increase the productivity of monoculture P. sylvestris plantations. Our research provides a potential solution to the problem of the declining productivity of sandy plantations caused by monocultures.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				MAY 1	2022	511								120158	10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120158		MAR 2022											WOS:000782282200004

However, the temporal patterns of soil moisture content (SMC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) with stand ages and the potential role of deep roots driving these patterns within deep profiles are still poorly understood. Here, we investigated variations in fine root distribution, SMC, and SOC content and density in 0-500 cm soil profiles under two deep-rooted plant systems with different stand ages (black locust plantation, Robinia pseudoacacia L.; and apple orchard, Malus pumila Mill.), evaluated their soil moisture deficit (SMD) and SOC sequestration effect relative to cropland, and attempted to characterize the role of deep roots in driving these variations. The results confirmed severe SMD in all soil layers within the 0-500 cm profile under black locust plantations, relative to cropland, but noting some SMC recovery under the 38-year-old black locust plantation. In contrast, depth-averaged (0-500 cm) SMC increased notably during the initial 5 years and then declined continuously over time under apple orchards. These results suggest the temporal pattern of SMC varies with deep-rooted systems. The SOC density of the 100-500 cm layer accounted for more than half of the entire profile, and SOC accumulation mostly occurred at depths below 300 cm under the two deep-rooted systems, which indicates the great importance of deep soils for carbon sequestration. The temporal patterns of deep SOC were different from those in surface soils. Obvious carbon losses were detected within the 20-500 cm soil profile under the 38-year-old black locust plantation. The linkages between SMC and SOC content were typically stronger under black locust plantations than under apple orchards. The influence of roots on SMC was stronger under apple orchards than under black locust plantations. Suitable land management practices are recommended to restore the fragile ecosystem of the CLP. Overall, our findings provide new insights for sustainable vegetation restoration in restored ecosystems.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				APR 15	2022	328								107855	10.1016/j.agee.2022.107855	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.107855		JAN 2022											WOS:000784336600003

Extreme heat waves have devastating impacts on both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. A multi-characteristic heat wave framework is used to estimate historical and future projected heat waves across Australia. A Google Earth Engine-based toolkit named heat wave tracker (HWT) is developed, which can be used for dynamic visualization, extraction, and processing of complex heat wave events. The toolkit exploits the public long-term high-resolution climate datasets to developed nine heat wave datasets across Australia for extreme heat wave value analysis.

However, the response of the soil water content (SWC) and SOM after the conversion of agricultural land to economic forestland have not been sufficiently clarified in semi-arid areas. To investigate the influence of land-use change on the SWC and SOM dynamics, we examined the SWC (0?400 cm depth) and SOM (0?60 cm depth) and growth status of fruit trees in three apricot (Armeniaca vulgaris Lam.) orchards of different ages (7, 12, and 22 years) under extensive management, together with those of adjacent cropland (control) on the Loess Plateau, China. The results showed that SWC significantly decreased with increasing stand age, and strong soil desiccation occurred in the 12-year-old apricot orchard after conversion from cropland. The annual growth rate of the dried soil layer between the 12th and 22nd years (12.00 cm y-1) was higher than that between the 1st and 12th years (6.67 cm y-1). The soil water deficit was 498.81 mm over 22 years in the 0?400 cm soil profiles. SOM stock was improved in the short term (7 y) compared with the cropland, and was consumed thereafter. Only the topsoil (0?20 cm soil profiles) experienced SOM consumption in the 12year-old orchard, but the SOM of all soil layers was consumed in the 22-year-old orchard. In the 0?60 cm soil profiles over 22 years, the SOM consumption was 26.53 Mg ha- 1. The length and diameter of peripheral branches generally decreased with increasing stand age; where those of the 22-year-old orchard were 83.87 % and 39.13 % lower than those of the 7-year-old orchard (P < 0.05). These results indicate that long-term planting of apricot trees under extensive management could aggravate soil water deficit and SOM consumption, and further limit apricot growth. Therefore, appropriate management measures should be implemented to maintain and improve the SWC and SOM conditions and enhance the productivity and vigour of the orchard over ten years of cultivation.

It is unclear, however, how the microbial composition and the potential function of C and N cycling change with forest secondary succession. Using soil metagenomic sequencing methods, we studied these changes in bacterial and fungal communities with secondary succession from cropland to a Quercus liaotungensis forest over approximately 120 years on the Loess Plateau of China. The results revealed the following. (1) Soil microbial biomass C, N, and P increased significantly in topsoil (0-20 cm) with vegetation succession. (2) The abundances of bacteria increased initially and then decreased slightly, whereas an increase in fungal abundances and the ratio of fungi to bacteria was detected along a successional gradient. Microbial communities tended to shift from r- to K-strategists, both at the phylum and genus levels. (3) With vegetation succession, the abundances of C and N cycle-related potential functional genes first significantly increased and then stabilized. Among them, the relative abundances of recalcitrant C degradation-, N fixation-, and ammonification-related genes increased, whereas labile C degradation-, N reduction-, and denitrification-related genes tended to decrease. (4) Redundancy analysis indicated that bacterial communities were influenced by available phosphorus contents and soil C: N ratios, and that fungal communities were mainly affected by ammonium N contents and root biomass. (5) Predicted microbial functional genes were affected by ammonium N and activated C contents. Our study showed that with vegetation succession, microbe communities tended to shift from r- to K-strategists both at the phylum and genus levels, which increased the abundance of organisms expressing C- and N-cycle related genes.

Partition of dietary energy by sheep fed fresh ryegrass (<i>Lolium perenne</i>) with a wide-ranging composition and quality	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE												Context Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is an important forage in temperate ruminant agricultural systems, but its quality and composition is highly variable and can become dominated by senescent material during summer and dry periods. Nutritive value is often predicted on the basis of chemical composition and calculated metabolisable energy (ME), which is rarely measured. Aim To measure the partition of energy from ryegrasses with widely varying proportions of leaf and senescent material, among faeces, urine and methane (CH4) in sheep. Methods Three experiments were undertaken with two groups of young wether sheep, fed seven diets of freshly cut ryegrass, at maintenance levels of intake to measure the partition of dietary energy among faeces, urine and CH4, enabling ME to be calculated. Across the seven diets, green leaf accounted for 16.0-87.6% of feed offered, whereas senescent material ranged from 2.8% to 65.0% and nitrogen (N) ranged between 8.6 and 31.2 g/kg DM. Measured ME was compared with predicted values based on digestible energy. Methane emissions were determined by both open-circuit respiration chambers and sulfur hexafluoride marker dilution. Key results Apparent digestibility (g/100 g) of DM ranged from 51.8 to 75.3 and N from 26.7 to 73.9. The percentage of the gross energy of feeds partitioned to CH4 (chamber) was 6.01-7.42, and 1.77-5.69 to urine. Effects of digestibility on CH4 yields (g/kg DM intake) were minor and the sum of energy losses to CH4 and urine were 13.5-17.6% of digestible energy (DE) intake, suggesting an underestimation of ME when predicted from DE. Use of sulfur hexafluoride substantially overestimated CH4 emissions when the permeation tubes had been in the sheep for 80 days. Conclusions A high proportion of senescent material in ryegrass had little effect on CH4 yields from sheep and energy losses to urine were mostly less than 3% of energy intake and were related to dietary N concentration. Implications Dietary ME calculated from DE is likely to be underestimated when ryegrass contains a high proportion of senescent material, due to reduced urinary energy losses, as CH4 yields are largely unaffected by maturity or senescence.

J	Wang, YH; Mu, Y; Yang, SJ; Wang, L				Wang, Yanhui; Mu, Yan; Yang, Shujian; Wang, Li			Effects of activated water irrigation on the growth, water consumption and water use efficiency of winter wheat	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION												Irrigation water activation technology is a new water treatment technology that promotes crop growth and improves water use efficiency (WUE) by altering the physical and chemical properties of water. Our study found that after activation treatment of groundwater, the pH levels and dissolved oxygen contents of water increased, and the surface tension and viscosity coefficients decreased. To verify the effect of this technology on winter wheat growth in the Guanzhong Plain, a three-year field experiment was conducted from 2018 to 2021 using activated water irrigation that included different irrigation treatments (i.e., 60 mm of magnetized and ionized water, MW1 and IW1; 120 mm, MW2 and IW2; 180 mm, MW3 and IW3), while 180 mm of groundwater (GW(3)) was used as a control. The results showed that, when compared with the GW(3) treatment, the MW3 and IW3 treatments significantly increased grain yields (GY), and this effect could be due to the increased chlorophyll contents, delayed senescence of the flag leaves during grain filling and then the significant increase in the dry matter accumulations at post-anthesis. In addition, the daily water consumption amounts in the MW3 and IW3 treatments were significantly higher than that in GW(3) treatment from joining to filling stages, which caused a slight increase in the WUEs. Both the GYs and WUEs of the MW2 and IW2 treatments significantly increased versus the GW(3) treatment. Therefore, we propose that 120 mm of activated water irrigation is the best mode for the Guanzhong Plain, which can save 60 mm of water.

However, breeding efforts to develop enhanced graft combinations are hindered by knowledge-gaps as to how rootstocks mediate scion-response to salt stress. We grafted the scion of cultivated M82 onto rootstocks of 254 tomato accessions and explored the morphological and metabolic responses of grafts under saline conditions (EC = 20 dS m(-1)) as compared to self-grafted M82 (SG-M82). Correlation analysis and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator were performed to address the association between morphological diversification and metabolic perturbation. We demonstrate that grafting the same variety onto different rootstocks resulted in scion phenotypic heterogeneity and emphasized the productivity efficiency of M82 irrespective of the rootstock. Spectrophotometric analysis to test lipid oxidation showed largest variability of malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalents across the population, while the least responsive trait was the ratio of fruit fresh weight to total fresh weight (FFW/TFW). Generally, grafts showed greater values for the traits measured than SG-M82, except for branch number and wild race-originated rootstocks; the latter were associated with smaller scion growth parameters. Highly responsive and correlated metabolites were identified across the graft collection including malate, citrate, and aspartate, and their variance was partly related to rootstock origin. A group of six metabolites that consistently characterized exceptional graft response was observed, consisting of sorbose, galactose, sucrose, fructose, myo-inositol, and proline. The correlation analysis and predictive modelling, integrating phenotype- and leaf metabolite data, suggest a potential predictive relation between a set of leaf metabolites and yield-related traits.

Grasslands are an important component of terrestrial ecosystems and play a key role in maintaining terrestrial ecosystem balance. Therefore, it is critical to understand the effects of nitrogen addition on grassland ecosystems. We conducted gradient N addition experiments (0, 3, 6, and 9 g N M-2 y(-1)) for three years in grassland communities with similar site conditions. We utilized four typical herbaceous plants, including the dominant species Bothriochloa ischemum (B. ischemum) and companion species Stipa bungeana (S. bungeana), Artemisia gmelinii (A. gmelinii), and Cleistogenes squarrosa (C. squarrosa), to explore how different plant-soil-microbe systems respond to N addition. Stoichiometric homeostasis analysis demonstrated that both plants and microbes were strictly homeostatic. However, the companion species were found to be more susceptible to P dominant species. Furthermore, aggravated overlap in stoichiometric niches between plant species were observed at the N6 and N9 levels. Vector analysis indicated that the vector angle was >45 degrees regardless of plant species and N levels, suggesting that there was a strong P limitation in the rhizosphere microbial community. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that the Composite roots exhibited a greater effect (explaining 34.7% of the variation) on the rhizosphere microbes than on the Gramineae, indicating that there may be more intense nutrient competition in its rhizosphere. In general, the effects of N addition on species were different across functional groups, with a significant positive effect on the Gramineae (B. ischemum, S. bungeana, and C. squarrosa) and a significant negative effect on the Compositae (A. gmelinii), which should be fully considered in the future ecological management and restoration.

However, soil phosphorus (P) dynamics following artificial plantation still remain unclear, especially at the regional scale. We aim to determine how do soil total P (TP) and available P (AP) change and how do drivers affect the dynamics of soil P following artificial plantation. Here we examined the effects of climate (precipitation and temperature), prior land use cover (cropland and barren land), current land use cover (forest, grassland, and shrubland), soil properties (soil organic carbon, bulk density, and pH), tree species, and plantation age on changes in soil TP and AP in top 100 cm following artificial plantation. Our examination was conducted based on a meta-analysis of 740 independent observations from 67 articles. The results showed that, across all the variations, TP concentrations significantly decreased by 17.5% in the top 100 cm soil layer following artificial plantation, with no significant change in AP. Concentration of TP in the 100 cm soil depth had a similar spatial pattern, characterized by a higher depletion in northwest area but lower depletion in southeast area. Climate, prior land use, tree species, and soil properties all played an important role on TP, while only tree species influenced AP response to artificial plantation. Our findings suggest that artificial plantation did not appear to directly induce P limitation because of the nearly unaltered AP in the regional scale. However, compared with lower TP depletion in southeast area, substantial declines in TP in northwest area may drive such region toward greater P limitation with the decrease of AP replenishment capacity in the future.

Their formation is usually due to a primary symmetry breaking of a uniform state to stripes, often followed by secondary instabilities to form zigzag and labyrinthine patterns. These secondary instabilities are well studied under idealized conditions of an infinite domain; however, on finite domains, the situation is more subtle since the unstable modes depend also on boundary conditions. Using two prototypical models, the Swift-Hohenberg equation and the forced complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, we consider finite size domains with no flux boundary conditions transversal to the stripes and reveal a distinct mixed-mode instability that lies in between the classical zigzag and the Eckhaus lines. This explains the stability of stripes in the mildly zigzag unstable regime and, after crossing the mixed-mode line, the evolution of zigzag stripes in the bulk of the domain and the formation of defects near the boundaries. The results are of particular importance for problems with large timescale separation, such as bulk-heterojunction deformations in organic photovoltaic and vegetation in semi-arid regions, where early temporal transients may play an important role.

Construction of SPP at large scale certainly changes the land surface with consequences on the local ecosystem. However, few studies have focused on these impacts. This study explored the influence of SPP on vegetation by modifying microhabitats. The soil water content (SWC), evaporation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil and air temperature (AT), vegetation coverage, biomass, and species richness were measured under different positions of the SPP and outside. The results showed that SWC in the station was much higher than that observed outside the SPP, and the evaporation in the SPP was lower than outside (P < .05). The PAR below the PV panel line zone is much lower than the interval (IT) zone. The surface coverage, biomass, and species richness were significantly higher in the SPP than outside the IT zone and outside the SPP (P < .05). The AT under the panel was 1.67 times lower than above during the plant growing season. The microhabitat index has a high correlation with biomass, coverage, and species richness. PV panels could impact microhabitat in arid sandy areas and accelerate vegetation recovery progress and quality. The SPP construction would not only supply clean energy but also bring unintended ecological benefits in the future.

But soil erosion on slope farmland is also affected by many other factors, such as topography and rainfall. In order to explore the effect of crop growth on soil erosion on different slope gradient of slope farmland, and analyze the interaction of crop growth and slope gradient on soil erosion, this study used artificial simulated rainfall to observe the runoff rates and soil loss amounts under different slope gradients for maize, soybeans, and winter wheat in different growth stages. Results showed that crops and slope gradient both significantly affected production and development of slope runoff. Compared with bare land, mean runoff rate on slopes was reduced by 24%, 32%, and 94% respectively, and sediment yield was decreased by 44%, 55%, and 99% respectively on maize, soybean, and winter wheat fields. Inhibitory effects of crops on slope runoff rate and sediment yield were enhanced with crop growth and decreased with increasing slope gradient. Crop growth and coverage could offset the impact of increasing slope gradient on runoff and sediment to some extent and reduced water and soil loss on slopes. Sediment yield was produced largely when the slope gradient was greater than 10 degrees on maize and soybean fields, but soil erosion was effectively inhibited when the slope gradient was less than 15 degrees on winter wheat fields. Crop planting can effectively reduce the impact of slope gradient on soil erosion, especially during the flourishing period of crop growth.																			0906-4710	1651-1913				JAN 2	2019	69	1					12	25		10.1080/09064710.2018.1488988	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2018.1488988													WOS:000448140300002

Effect of climatic variability and weather factors on development of tomato early blight in a hot semi-arid region of Southern India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURE												Effect of cultivars, planting periods, weather and climatic variability on early blight (EB) severity was studied over six kharif seasons (2011-16) at Rajendranagar, Telangana. Wider seasonal variations in onset (July-September) and peak severity (September-November) of EB was noted coinciding with 1-7 and 9-14 weeks after transplanting, respectively. Mean EB severity was highest in 2012 on both calendar (47.8%) and crop age (64%) basis. EB severity on cultivars viz., US 3140 (20.8%) and Lakshmi (21.8%) was significantly lower over Heemsohna (24.2%) and DS 810 (25.8%). Plantings of June-July had higher severity (27.9%) over August-September (19.1%). Maximum and minimum temperature besides rainfall variability over long term normals for 2011-16 was 0.7 degrees C, 0.8 degrees C and 3.6 mm/week, respectively with their corresponding actuals of 31.8 degrees C, 22.5 degrees C and 28.3 mm/week. Negative impact of increasing minimum and maximum temperature and positive effect of increasing rainfall on EB severity was documented. Significant associations of EB severity with weather and climatic variability similar over seasons indicated evolving adaptations of early blight to climate change.																			0972-8538	1875-8711				JUN	2020	77	2					333	338		10.5958/0974-0112.2020.00046.8	http://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-0112.2020.00046.8													WOS:000576149800016

Reliable simulation of mulched soil surface temperature is important for initial growth of spring crops. The hybrid Root Zone Water Quality-Simultaneous Heat and Water (RZ-SHAW) model and the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model use different approaches to quantify the effect of plastic film mulching on soil temperature. A two-year field study was conducted to compare the performance of the RZ-SHAW model and DNDC model for simulating the 5-cm soil temperature (T-5) under varying plastic film mulching coverages during seedling emergence of spring maize. Three treatments were used in this study: no mulching (PMO), full plastic film mulch (PM100), and partial plastic film mulch with 60 % coverage, i.e. 60 cm width of plastic every meter (PM60). Compared with no mulching, PM100 and PM60 treatments enhanced daily maximum and average T-5 (2.53 degrees C and 1.25 degrees C, respectively; p < 0.05) while not affecting the diurnal sinusoidal phase change of T-5 (2.45 degrees C and 1.21 degrees C, respectively; p < 0.05). The RZ-SHAW model was robust for T-5 simulation under mulching condition with RMSE and NSE ranged from 2.01 degrees C to 2.51 degrees C and 0.68 to 0.84, respectively, while the DNDC model failed to predict T-5 for mulched soil with RMSE and NSE ranged from 2.79 degrees C to 4.33 degrees C and 0.25 to 0.46, respectively. Employing T-ms (air temperature between plastic film and soil surface) to replace soil surface temperature may be one reason for the poor T-5 simulation of DNDC in mulched plots. By contrast, the RZ-SHAW model ran a complete calculation for heat and vapour transfer within the mulched layer, which robustly simulated atmosphere-soil surface temperature gradient in the plant canopy, surface covering, and soil surface in a broader range of climatic conditions. Additionally, the longwave radiation reflected back to the soil surface by the plastic, which was not considered by DNDC model, was important and enhanced T-5 simulation performance for RZ-SHAW under mulching condition.

The rhizosphere microbial index (RMI) of different typical species was conducted using principal component analysis (PCA), and the driving factors affecting RMI were identified by partial least squares path modelling. The results showed that the greatest RMI was observed under Medicago sativa (0.561), followed by Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica (0.509), Hedysarum scoparium (0.470), Amorpha fruticosa (0.469) and Amygdalus pedunculata (0.416). From the perspective of nutrient input and ecological services, Medicago sativa with nitrogen fixation and Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica with strong sand-fixing and sand-prevention function which have higher RMI values could be recommended for vegetation restoration in Mu Us Sandy Land. In addition, the transformation and microbial decomposition of soil phosphorus (total phosphorus, available phosphorus, microbial biomass phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase) had a great impact on the rhizosphere microbial activity of typical plants in a desertified region. Partial least squares path modelling, generalized linear regression analysis and the Pearson correlation analysis suggested that dissolved organic carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were the driving factors affecting the RMIs among typical plants. Medicago sativa and Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica could be the most suitable species for vegetation restoration in Mu Us sandy land. In addition, dissolved organic carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen and rhizosphere phosphorus transformation and utilization played a crucial role in affecting the rhizosphere microbes of typical plants.																			0718-9508	0718-9516				SEP	2022	22	3					3118	3129		10.1007/s42729-022-00872-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42729-022-00872-2		MAY 2022											WOS:000800989200003

Understanding how understory shading affects herbs growth and soil erosion controlling benefits is essential for better policy management. Here, we investigated grassland characteristics and soil erosion process before and after grasslands placed beneath the forest canopies. Four typical grasslands (Trifolium repens, Medicago sativa, Elymus dahuricus and Bromus inermis) of the Loess Plateau were selected, and bare land was used as the control. Total fifteen plots (three replicates for each treatment) with a slope of 20 degrees were constructed. All plots were placed outdoor (open areas) in the first year, and were moved to the undergrowth and remained in the Sophora japonica and Populus cathayana forests over the next five years. Time to runoff, runoff volume and sediment yield were examined by two simulated rainfall experiments before and after understory shading. Results showed that understory shading promoted the disappearance of the original grass species, increasing weeds with poor roots. Further, these changes led to more soil loss in all understory grassland treatments. After understory shading, the runoff volume (67.0-125.5 L) and biological soil crust coverage (1.0-15.7%) significantly decreased for all plots, whereas the sediment yield (5.0-1650.5 g), species richness (>5) and litter mass (75.8-241.0 g) significantly increased. Therefore, understory shading changed the community composition and structure of understory grasslands. Besides, we found that herb species difference, but not species richness difference, more determined understory soil erodibility. Our findings indicate that the shadetolerant herb species application could effectively reduce soil erosion in forest-grassland complex ecosystem will help to achieve the sustainability of understory grassland during vegetation restoration.

An in-situ simulation experiment of rainfall and upstream inflow in the gullied loess region, China	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Land use/cover plays a crucial role in gully head retreat (GHR). However, little is known about how land use/cover influences GHR rates. An in situ simulation experiment of rainfall and upstream inflow was conducted in a gullied loess region to investigate hydraulic erosion, mass movements, and linear GHR processes under three types of land use/cover (bare land, grassland, and shrub-grass land). The results showed that the average linear GHR rates on grassland and shrub-grass land were 87-89% and 72-81% lower than that on bare land (0.99-2.06 cm min(-1)), respectively. Gully heads retreat by hydraulic and gravitational erosion. In the case of hydraulic erosion, upstream runoff incision is dominant on bare land, while undercutting by on-wall and jet flow dominates on grassland and shrub-grass land. In the case of mass movement, collapse dominates with a frequency of 62-100%, of which gully sidewall collapse is most common, especially on bare land and it acts to widen the gully. Gully headwall collapse dominates on grassland and shrub-grass land to cause retreat of the gully head. Overall, on bare land, upstream runoff incision dominates GHR. However, on grassland/shrub-grass land GHR is mainly driven by the undercutting of on-wall and jet flow and subsequent gully headwall collapses. As a consequence, the GHR length on bare land exponentially increases over time, while on grassland or shrub-grass land, it discretely increases as an analogous step function. Moreover, the average linear GHR rate on grassland was considerably lower than that on shrub-grass land, implying that an optimized vegetation restoration pattern enhances GHR control.

However, the belowground soil water responses in the afforestation-cropland interface (ACI) is not well known. This study analyzed the variability of soil water storage (SWS) and deficit in three ACIs taking into account the distance between the forest and cropland. The variations of soil water content up to 4 m depth and at five distances from the interface (-5 m (in forest), 0 m (interface), 1 m, 3 m and 5 m (in cropland)) were estimated in three artificial forests (Salix matsudana, Sophora japonica, and Populus cathayana) and their adjacent croplands (maize). The results showed that soil water at the interfaces was significantly affected by forest. This effect was effective up to 160-170 cm of soil depth, and the ACI of S. matsudana had the greatest impact on the farmland soil water. There was no significant relative soil water deficit between 1 and 3 m length, and the ACI of P. cathayana showed the lowest changes in the lateral direction. The SWS of S. japonica in the ACI was clearly higher than the other two artificial forests (P < 0.05). Our findings indicated that S. japonica was the most suitable forest species for agriculture sustainability in the study area. The tree species and the distance between cropland and forest should be considered during the establishment of agroforestry systems. This study provided insights for water conservation and effective management of ACIs in semi-arid areas.

Rhizobial type III secretion systems (T3SSs) deliver effectors that manipulate the metabolism of eukaryotic host cells. Mesorhizobium amorphae CCNWGSO123 (GSO123) contains two T3SS gene clusters, T3SS-I and T3SS-II. T3SS-I contains all the basal components for an integrated T3SS, and the expression of T3SS-I genes is up-regulated in the presence of flavonoids. In contrast, T3SS-II lacks the primary extracellular elements of T3SSs, and the expression of T3SS-II genes is down-regulated in the presence of flavonoids. Inoculation tests on Robinia pseudoacacia displayed considerable differences in gene expression patterns and levels among roots inoculated with GSO123 and T3SS-deficient mutant (GSO123 Delta rhcN1 (GSO123 Delta T1), GSO123 Delta rhcN2 (GSO123 Delta T2) and GSO123 Delta rhcN1 Delta rhcN2 (GSO123 Delta S)). Compared with the GSO123-inoculated plants, GSO123 Delta T1-inoculated roots formed very few infection threads and effective nodules, while GSO123 Delta T2-inoculated roots formed a little fewer infection threads and effective nodules with increased numbers of bacteroids enclosed in one symbiosome. Moreover, almost no infection threads or effective nodules were observed in GSO123 Delta S-inoculated roots. In addition to evaluations of plant immunity signals, we observed that the coexistence of T3SS-I and T3SS-II promoted infection by suppressing host defense response in the reactive oxygen species defense response pathway. Future studies should focus on identifying rhizobial T3SS effectors and their host target proteins.

To harness their unique allelic diversity, we produced a large nested association mapping (NAM) population intercrossing fifty Ethiopian FVs with an international elite durum wheat variety (Asassa). The Ethiopian NAM population (EtNAM) is composed of fifty interconnected bi-parental families, totalling 6280 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that represent both a powerful quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping tool, and a large pre-breeding panel. Here, we discuss the molecular and phenotypic diversity of the EtNAM founder lines, then we use an array featuring 13 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to characterize a subset of 1200 EtNAM RILs from 12 families. Finally, we test the usefulness of the population by mapping phenology traits and plant height using a genome wide association (GWA) approach. EtNAM RILs showed high allelic variation and a genetic makeup combining genetic diversity from Ethiopian FVs with the international durum wheat allele pool. EtNAM SNP data were projected on the fully sequenced AB genome of wild emmer wheat, and were used to estimate pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures that reported an LD decay distance of 7.4 Mb on average, and balanced founder contributions across EtNAM families. GWA analyses identified 11 genomic loci individually affecting up to 3 days in flowering time and more than 1.6 cm in height. We argue that the EtNAM is a powerful tool to support the production of new durum wheat varieties targeting local and global agriculture.

However, how soil microbial functional genes involved in soil N cycling respond to mulching practices is not well known. MethodsWe collected soil samples from a spring maize field mulched with crop straw (SM) and plastic film (FM) for 10-year and with no mulching (CK) in the Loess Plateau. Microbial functional genes involved in soil N cycling were quantified using metagenomic sequencing. We collected soil samples from a spring maize field mulched with crop straw (SM) and plastic film (FM) for 10-year and with no mulching (CK) in the Loess Plateau. Microbial functional genes involved in soil N cycling were quantified using metagenomic sequencing. ResultsCompared to that in CK, the total abundance of genes involved in soil N cycling increased in SM but had no significant changes in FM. Specifically, SM increased the abundances of functional genes that involved in dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (nirB, napA, and nrfA), while FM decreased the abundances of functional genes that involved in ammonification (ureC and ureA) in comparison with CK. Other genes involved in assimilatory nitrate reduction, denitrification, and ammonia assimilation, however, were not significantly changed with mulching practices. The nirB and napA were derived from Proteobacteria (mainly Sorangium), and the ureC was derived from Actinobacteria (mainly Streptomyces). Mental test showed that the abundance of functional genes that involved in dissimilatory nitrate reduction was positively correlated with the contents of soil microbial biomass N, potential N mineralization, particulate organic N, and C fractions, while ammonification related gene abundance was positively correlated with soil pH, microbial biomass C and N, and mineral N contents. DiscussionOverall, this study showed that SM could improve soil N availability and promote the soil N cycling by increasing the abundance of functional genes that involved in DNRA, while FM reduced the abundance of functional genes that involved in ammonification and inhibited soil N cycling.																				1664-302X				JUL 11	2023	14								1205088	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1205088	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1205088								37497548					WOS:001032566200001

In this study, a 4-year field experiment was conducted in an irrigation district in China using three levels of irrigation [high (400 mm), medium (300 mm) and low (200 mm)] and two levels of fertilization [high (600 kg/ha P2O5 + 300 kg/ha urea) and low (300 kg/ha P2O5 + 150 kg/ha urea)] to reveal the ecological roles of core and noncore taxa in maintaining soil nutrient cycling and their associations with microbial network stability. Our results showed that combining medium irrigation with low fertilization resulted in higher levels of soil organic C, inorganic N, available P, multinutrient cycling and noncore bacterial diversity compared with the other treatments. Soils supporting a higher diversity of noncore bacterial taxa had a high soil multinutrient cycling index, while soils harbouring highly diverse core taxa exhibited a more stable bacterial network. The soil multinutrient cycling index was also significantly positively related to the subnetwork modularity of noncore taxa. Moreover, noncore taxa could serve as diverse pools that turn into core taxa in response to changes in the external environment. Acinetobacter, Flavobacterium, Gemmatimonas and Salinimicrobium, which belong to the noncore taxa, were involved in soil C and N cycling in the arid agricultural ecosystem. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that soil microbiota contribute differently to ecosystem functions. Changes in soil nutrient cycling were more closely related to variations in noncore taxa, while bacterial network stability was more associated with core taxa. Our study emphasized the role of noncore microbiota, which has been neglected in previous studies. Furthermore, our findings suggested that combining medium irrigation with low fertilization is effective for enhancing soil nutrients and bacterial diversity, providing guidance for managing arid agricultural ecosystems.

The aim of this study is to develop a sediment transport capacity prediction model applicable to a variety of soils. Materials and methods Sandy loess and loess soil (d(50) = 0.095 mm and d(50)' = 0.04 mm) were used to conduct indoor sediment transport experiments under different hydraulic conditions. Moreover, the experimental data of cohesive soil and cohesionless sand was combined, and the response relationship between sediment transport capacity and each flow intensity parameter was analyzed through dimensionless processing. Results and discussion Results showed that the sediment transport capacity had an exponential function relationship with unit discharges and energy slopes. The sediment transport capacity also varied with the changing flow intensity parameters, and through analysis, the effective stream power was observed as an optimum predictor (R-2 = 0.9692). Considering the effective stream power and volumetric sediment concentration, this study derived a formula for calculating the sediment transport capacity. Conclusions In conclusion, this study innovatively established a prediction model of sediment transport capacity on loessial slopes though regression analysis and dimensionless method. The proposed model is capable of considering flow intensities and volumetric sediment concentration simultaneously, and has a superior applicability to both cohesive soil and cohesionless sand compared with the four main existing models.					wang, jian/HRB-9588-2023; Wang, Jing/IQW-3496-2023; wang, jing/HJA-5384-2022; wang, jiajun/JRW-6032-2023; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; wang, juan/IUO-6218-2023; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022; wang, dan/JEF-0836-2023; wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; ZHOU, YUE/IZE-6277-2023; wang, jie/HTQ-4920-2023; wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023; wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023	Wang, Jing/0000-0002-8296-2961; 													1439-0108	1614-7480				JAN	2022	22	1					238	255		10.1007/s11368-021-03070-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-021-03070-2		SEP 2021											WOS:000698868300001

In this work, a kind of highly selective phosphate adsorbent, microporous carbon material (MCM), based on glucose was synthesized by hydrothermal and activation method. The MCM were characterized by SEM, XPS, BET, element analysis, et al. The phosphate adsorption mechanism of MCM were investigated by batch adsorption experiment and model calculation. Results showed that MCM had a high adsorption capacity for phosphate in a wide range of pH (1.5-10). Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order kinetic revealed that the process was endothermic and involved both physical and chemical adsorption. The main phosphate adsorption mechanisms of MCM are electrostatic attraction, ion complexation, hydrogen bonding, and physical adsorption. The ions competition simulation experiment indicated that the MCM was highly selective for phosphate removal. Furthermore, the phosphate adsorption tests were carried out on five kinds of water, and the removal rates were all above 99.98%. The 20 regenerative cycles experiment revealed that the MCM had high reusability. Therefore, this kind of novel glucose-based highly selective phosphate adsorbent with multi-cycle phosphorus removal performance can improve the eutrophication of water. This study provides a new idea for phosphate removal and expands the application range of glucose-based carbon materials. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We developed a plastic temperature response function by assuming that development rate was linearly related to temperature and that the linearity was linearly responsive to day of year (DOYv) of the starting date of the vegetative growth period (VGP). Phenology observations and weather data were acquired for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] at 12 locations over 15-26 yr. Additional data were observed for maize grown in an interval planting experiment. For 78.6% of the sites, the crop development rate during the VGP was positively affected by DOYv. Partial correlation analysis (controlling for temperature) indicated that DOYv was independent of temperature. When averaged over all crops and sites, the RMSE for a plastic phenology model based on both response and adaptation mechanisms was lower (RMSE = 2.81 d) than models (RMSE = 3.39) based only on response mechanism (p < .01). Furthermore, simulations produced by the plastic model showed less bias to DOYv, temperature, and year. The plastic function provided a simple and effective method for achieving better phenology simulation accuracy. According to the plastic function, growing season under warming conditions will not be reduced by as much as simulated by models based only on response mechanism, so yield loss due to warming is likely to be overestimated.					yang, jianying/N-4615-2013; Song, Yanling/AAT-7783-2020; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009	Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Wu, Dingrong/0000-0002-1400-9108; Wang, Peijuan/0000-0003-3648-1355													0002-1962	1435-0645				SEP-OCT	2020	112	5					3832	3846		10.1002/agj2.20112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.20112													WOS:000600983000052

The study occurred in long-term revegetation experiment with seven successional stages (0, 11, 35, 60, 100, 130 and 150 years) in the Loess Plateau, China. Microbes maintained stoichiometric homeostasis in all successional stages, but plants did not. Microbial metabolism was limited by low soil phosphorus (P) concentration throughout the succession, whereas plants were limited by low soil P during the late successional stages (from 60 to 150 years) only. An increase in soil moisture during succession was associated with greater P limitation in microbes and plants. There was less microbial P limitation at the 35-year successional stage, and the greatest microbial P limitation occurred at the 130-year successional stage. The microbial C limitation followed a unimodal pattern through the vegetation succession and reached a maximum at 100 years of succession (the early forest stage). This coincided with the lowest microbial CUE at 100 years of succession (CUE was from 0.24 to 0.41), suggesting a change in the physiological responses from microbes (such as enzyme synthesis and the priming effect), that tended to reduce soil C sequestration. Our results indicate that soil moisture regulated microbial C and P metabolism during the vegetation succession in this semiarid region, which has implications for understanding how microbial metabolism affects soil C dynamics under vegetation restoration.

Few studies have been conducted and reported on highly eroded hilly-gully watersheds. In this field study, a constructed dam-controlled hilly-gully watershed in northeastern China was selected to identify the sources of soil C and N losses. Soils at various land uses and landscape positions, and sediments near the constructed dam, were collected and analyzed for selected physiochemical properties, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15). Soil C and N loss and deposition in the watershed were assessed and the relative contributions of each source quantified by a stable isotope mixing model (SIAR). Results indicated that soil C loss was primarily from cropland, accounting for 58.75%, followed by gully (25.49%), forest (9.2%), and grassland (6.49%). Soil N loss was similar to soil C, with cropland contribution of 80.58%, gully of 10.30%, grassland of 7.54%, and forest of 1.59%. The C and N deposition gradually decreased along the direction of the runoff pathway near the constructed dam, and the deposited C and N from cropland and gullies showed an order: middle-dam > bottom-dam > upper-dam and upper-dam > bottom-dam > middle-dam, respectively. A high correlation between soil TOC or TN and the sediment properties suggested that the deposition conditions could be the major factors affecting the C and N pools in the sedimentary zones. This study would provide a scientific insight to develop effective management practices for soil erosion and nutrient loss control in highly eroded agriculture watersheds.					wang, qi/ITT-9652-2023; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022															1660-4601				MAR	2021	18	6							2971	10.3390/ijerph18062971	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062971								33799380					WOS:000639237000001

Soil microbial metabolism plays a vital role in biogeochemical cycles and soil functions. However, the response of microbial metabolism to heavy metal contamination in soil remains elusive despite potentially offering important insight into the health and ecological consequences of soil ecosystems under such contamination. This study used extracellular enzyme stoichiometry models to identify the response of microbial metabolism to various heavy metal contaminants, while also revealing potential implications of heavy metal contaminates in soil ecosystems. Results showed that microbial metabolism was restricted by soil carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) within a heavy metal polluted area in Northwest China. Heavy metal stress significantly increased microbial C limitation while decreasing microbial P limitation. However, microbial C and P limitations both responded consistently to different heavy metals (i.e., Cd, Pb, Zn, and Cu). Heavy metals had the greatest effect on microbial C limitation (i.e., 0.720 of the total effects) compared to other soil properties, and soil with the lowest heavy metal concentration exhibited the lowest microbial C limitation, and vice versa. These results indicated that microbial metabolic limitation can robustly and sensitively reflect the degree of heavy metals pollution in soil. Additionally, increased microbial C limitation caused by heavy metal contaminants could potentially escalate C release by promoting soil C decomposition as well as increasing investments in enzyme production and the maintenance of metabolic processes. Consequently, potential C loss induced by heavy metal pollution on soil eco-systems may be extensive and significant. Generally, our results suggest the usefulness of extracellular enzyme stoichiometry as a new method from which to evaluate heavy metal soil pollution, while microbial metabolic limitation could potentially be a promising indicator.

The magnitude and spatiotemporal dynamics of soil water content (SWC) provide basic guidance for optimal vegetation restoration. In a semiarid Chinese area, the changes in the soil water storage (SWS) of five cultivated grasslands and one wasteland were observed, to evaluate the water consumption at different soil depths (0-100 cm), from 2008 to 2012. The plants of the three leguminous species consumed more water in deep soil layers (80-100 cm) and produced more aboveground biomass than the plants of the two gramineous species. The gramineous plants mainly consumed shallow soil water (0 <= 30 cm). The soil water deficit in the whole soil profile of Medicago sativa grassland (43-48%) was significantly higher than the deficit of the gramineous grasslands (p < .05). After 5 years of planting, the SWC of Agropyron cristatum grassland (21%) was the highest in the 20- to 80-cm soil layer. The variation of SWS in M. sativa grassland did not significantly differ during this period, although its mean value was 28% lower than the value in A. cristatum grassland (181 mm). At the end of the experiment, leguminous grasslands caused a serious soil water shortage deficit in the 80- to 100-cm soil layers. These results underscore that vegetation type determines the vertical distribution of soil water deficit, particularly in deep layers. To promote long-term sustainability of water resources, planting A. cristatum may be a good choice for early grassland restoration in arid areas.

Comparing Plasticity of Response to Perceived Risk in the Textbook Example of Convergent Evolution of Desert Rodents and Their Predators; a Manipulative Study Employing the Landscape of Fear	FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE												Foragers process information they gain from their surroundings to assess the risk from predators and balance it with the resources in their environment. Measuring these perceived risks from the perspective of the forager can produce a heatmap or their "fear" in the environments, a so-called "landscape of fear" (LOF). In an intercontinental comparison of rodents from the Mojave and Negev Deserts, we set to compare families that are used regularly as examples of convergent evolution, heteromyid and gerbilline respectively. Using a LOF spatial-analysis on data collected from common garden experiments in a semi-natural arena we asked: (1) do all four species understand the risk similarly in the exact same physical environment; (2) does relative relation between species affect the way species draw their LOFs, or does the evolutionary niche of a species have a greater impact on its LOF?; and (3) does predator facilitation between vipers and barn owls cause similar changes to the shape of the measured LOFs. For stronger comparative power we mapped the LOF of the rodents under two levels of risk: low risk (snakes only) and high risk (snakes and barn owls). We found concordance in the way all four species assessed risk in the arena. However, the patterns observed in the LOFs of each rodent family were different, and the way the topographic shape of the LOF changed when owls were introduced varied by species. Specifically, gerbils were more sensitive to owl-related risk than snakes and at the opposite correct for heteromyids. Our findings suggest that the community and environment in which a species evolved has a strong impact on the strategies said animals employ. We also conclude, that given the homogenous landscape we provide in our arena and the non- homogenous patterns of LOF maps, risk assessment can be independent of the physical conditions under which the animals find themselves.

However, the effects of individual or combined rainwater regulation measures, such as infil-tration holes, mulch, and fish-scale pits (a semicircle-shaped pit), on soil water infiltration and restoration in such regions have not yet been fully explored. In this study, the responses of soil water to rainfall in the 0-1.6 m soil layer was investigated through in situ monitoring during the two main rainy seasons under four rainwater regulation treatments in the Pisha Sandstone area of China covered in thin soil layer (0-0.3 m): fish-scale pits with grass mulching and infiltration holes (PGH), fish-scale pits with grass mulching (PG), fish-scale pits without mulching (P), and slope land (control, CK). The results have shown that because of the relatively low perme-ability (0.08-0.17 m d-1) of Pisha Sandstone, individual torrential rainfall events (63.2 mm) increased the soil water only in the 0-0.3 m layer after 3 days under the CK, P, and PG treatments. However, the PGH treatment simultaneously and significantly increased the soil water in the 0-0.3 m and 0.7-0.8 m layers. Compared with the CK treatment, rainwater replenishment depths under the P, PG, and PGH treatments increased from approxi-mately 0.4 m to 0.9 m, 1.0 m, and 1.1 m, respectively, and the average soil water storage increased by 27 mm, 34 mm, and 50 mm, respectively, in the 0-1.6 m soil layer. Moreover, the PGH treatment enhanced rainwater storage in deep soil (0.6-0.9 m), which decreased the potential for water loss by evaporation. We concluded that the PGH treatment was effective in increasing soil water storage and reducing soil erosion in areas with shallow buried bedrock.

The top 500 cm soils of the main introduced vegetation types restored for different years in Chinese Mu Us Sandy Land were collected, and the soil moisture and influencing factors were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the total soil water storage decreased in a sequence of shrub land (S) > arbor land (A) > shifting sandy land (CK) > grassland (G). With the increase of restoration period, the soil moisture increased in arbor land and decreased first and then increased in both shrub land and grassland. Soil moisture was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with root length density (RLD) in G(56), S-36, A(21), and S-21. RLD and soil moisture in S(56)showed an extremely significant negative correlation (P < 0.01). Soil water content had a positive correlation with silt content (P < 0.05) but demonstrated a negative correlation with the sand content (P < 0.05) in A(56). Both silt and sand contents showed negative correlations with soil moisture in G(56)(P < 0.05). In summary, vegetation type, restoration period, RLD, and silt and clay contents have significant effects on soil moisture. To improve the soil moisture status, arbors and bushes should be preferentially considered for vegetation restoration in semi-arid northwest of China.

GROWTH IN SEMIARID FARMLAND SOIL	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Understanding the differences of labile soil organic matter between plastic film mulching at all growing stages (FM) and plastic film removal after the silking stage (RM) is essential to identify changes in soil quality and N availability. Compared to the FM treatment, the RM treatment significantly decreased the microbial biomass C (MBC) content, water soluble organic C content in the 0-20 cm layer and extractable organic C content in 2011 at milk stage (R3); however, it significantly increased the MBC content at planting time (PT) or the 6th leaf stage (V6) of the next growing season. Moreover, compared with the FM treatment, the RM treatment significantly increased the microbial biomass N content from silking stage to physiological maturity (R6) in the 0-20 cm layer and extractable organic N (EON) content at R6 in 2012; however, it significantly decreased the water soluble organic N (WSON) content at R3 and the WSON and EON contents at PT or V6 of the next growing season. Thus, plastic film mulching with film removal during the maize reproductive stages could be an excellent option for maintaining soil quality and improving soil N availability in the temperature- and rainfall-limited regions of northwest China.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	6					13657	13672		10.15666/aeer/1706_1365713672	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1706_1365713672													WOS:000505251300069

Black locust (R. pseudoacacia) is a deep-rooted forest species but the benefits of deep roots for water uptake under drought conditions are unclear. In this study, we assessed the effects of drought on water storage and the hydrological properties of soil at different depths. We performed a precipitation manipulation experiment continuously from June 2015 to November 2016 using mature R. pseudoacacia in the Loess Plateau region of China. The soil volumetric water contents were measured in the 0-4 m soil layer, as well as the soil hydrological properties comprising the soil bulk density (BD), total porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and aggregate-associated organic carbon (OC) concentration in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The results showed that soil water storage deficit mainly occurred in the 0-1 m soil layer rather than in the 1-4 m layer after excluding precipitation for two years. Compared with the control, excluding precipitation for two years decreased the soil water storage in the 0-1 m soil layer by 18%. Precipitation exclusion also significantly decreased the soil Ks by 28% and total porosity by 17%, but increased BD by 20% in the 0-10 cm soil layer. In addition, precipitation exclusion significantly decreased the total soil OC concentration and macro- and micro-associated OC concentrations. Our results indicate that excluding precipitation for two years could potentially degrade the water conditions in the topsoil layer but not the deeper soil. These findings provide insights into water management and sustainability in semi-humid afforestation areas of the Loess Plateau region in China.

Climate change affects the sustainability of crops in cropping sequence. The application of crop sequence modelling to evaluate the sustainability of cropping sequences under projected climate is a less explored area. MethodsThe present work evaluated the impact of projected climate on six cropping sequences viz., rice-mustard-groundnut, rice-lentil-groundnut, rice-potato-groundnut, rice-wheat-groundnut, rice-maize-groundnut and rice-mustard-fallow in the Lower Gangetic Plain of India. CMIP-5 multi-model ensemble, long-term crop sequence modelling using DSSAT and a multiple criteria decision analysis tool, TOPSIS was used to evaluate sustainability. Future climate scenarios were developed using 29 GCMs from which a subset of 5 representative GCMs was selected for mid-century (2040-2069) and end-century (2070-99) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Weighted average ensemble yield, ETa and nitrogen fixed by all cropping sequences for the study period were used to rank cropping sequences for sustainability using TOPSIS. Results and DiscussionThe minimum and maximum temperatures during mid and end-centuries were projected to be consistently higher than the baseline period (1980-2010) for all the cropping seasons. Under all the periods, rice-lentil-groundnut had the highest weighted average ensemble yield, followed by rice-wheat-groundnut. Rice-lentil-groundnut fixed the highest quantity of nitrogen, followed by rice-maize-groundnut. Ranking of cropping sequences for sustainability by the TOPSIS method indicated that during mid-century (under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), the rice-lentil-groundnut sequence will be the most sustainable cropping sequence. However, by the end century, the rice-wheat-groundnut sequence will be the most sustainable cropping sequence, followed by rice-lentil-groundnut under both RCP4.5 and 8.5. In all the cropping sequences, rice will be benefitted by higher amount of nitrogen fixed and preceding groundnut. The three parameters considered for defining sustainability in crop production (yield, ETa and N-fixed) ensures higher produce and return for the farmer, less dependence on irrigation sources and increase in soil nitrogen content. In this paper, we show for the first time that cropping sequences can be evaluated for sustainability by combining crop sequence modelling, GCM ensemble and multi-criteria decision analysis. The results of the study will help the farmers of the study area to opt for the most sustainable cropping sequence and other alternatives in the context of climate change.

A typical grassland community in the Loess Hilly-gully region on the Loess Plateau, Bothriochloa ischaemum community, was investigated with treatments of four nitrogen (N) addition (0, 25, 50, and 100 kg center dot N center dot ha(-1) center dot yr(-1)) and four phosphorus (P) addition treatments (0, 20, 40, and 80 P2O5 center dot kg center dot ha(-1) center dot yr(-1)). Based on hyperspectral and community N and P nutrient content measurements, combined with the first derivative treatment in the red-edge region, 18 characteristicspectral parameters consisting of vegetation indexes, characteristic bands and red-edge parameters, the characteristicspectral parameters sensitive to the N and P content and N : P ratio of B. ischaemum community were screened by multiple linear stepwise regression (SWR) methods, and an inverse model was established to estimate the aboveground total N content and total P content and N : P ratio in the community. Results showed that the N and P content of the B. ischaemum community increased with N application, and the N : P ratio decreased with P application; the spectral reflectance under N and P addition is inversely proportional to fertilizer application in the visible band and positively proportional to fertilizer application in the near-infrared band, and the "double-peak phenomenon" of the first derivative in the red-edge region was significantly affected by N and P addition. Among them, TBSI, R-910 and AMP contributed significantly to the model for N estimation (R-2 =0. 87, F=18. 8* * *), while DVI, mSR705, R-430, R-660 and AMP contributed significantly to the model for P estimation (R-2 =0. 91, F=20. 51* * *), and Slope725 contributed the most to the model for the estimation of N : P ratio (R-2 = 0. 54, F= 5. 14* * *). This study used hyperspectral technology to achieve a rapid estimation of the N and P content of the B. ischaemum community, and based on the significant correlation between N and P content and N : P ratio and spectral feature parameters, the parameter combination with the highest accuracy was selected, which laid a foundation for the method and parameter selection of monitoring grassland nutrient content after N and P addition at large scale.																			1000-0593					MAY	2023	43	5					1612	1621		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2023)05-1612-10	http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2023)05-1612-10													WOS:001027826000038

However, the information on the trade-offs between soil nutrient and productivity of alfalfa grassland following long-term cultivation under intensive agricultural management is scare. Six alfalfa grasslands of different ages under a highly intensive agricultural management system were chosen for this study. It was shown that long-term planting of alfalfa reduced soil nutrients overall. In the 0-100, 100-200, and 200-300 cm layers, the highest values of soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (TN), and soil total phosphorus (TP) content were observed in one-year-old alfalfa grassland. SOC, TN, and TP contents in each 100 cm soil layers linearly declined with increasing stand age, and decreasing rates of SOC and TN (4.31 and 0.03 g kg(-1)yr(-1)) in the 0-100 cm layer were higher than other two soil layers. The SOC storage (SOCS) and TN storage (TNS) in 0-20 cm soil were significantly higher than other soil profiles in six alfalfa grasslands of different ages. SOC(S)and TN(S)in 0-100 cm, especially in upper 40 cm soil, decreased over time until the fourth year, and gradually increased in the fifth and sixth years. While in the third and fourth years, productivity reached peak value (3.13 and 3.12 t ha(-1)), and then reduced. Correlation analysis showed productivity was significantly negatively correlated with SOC(S)and TN(S)in 0-100 cm soil depth. The decline in soil nutrients affected alfalfa growth and then feedback its productivity, and the optimal stand age of alfalfa grasslands should not be longer than 6 years for the limitation of soil nutrient, especially SOC storage. To acquire sustainable high productivity of artificial alfalfa grassland, our study suggested that more organic and nitrogen/phosphorus fertilizers should be applied to the upper soil layer beginning in the third year after planting.

The application of straw mulch has long been considered as an effective measure to reduce soil erosion, but the effects of straw mulch and straw incorporation on thawed soil erosion remain uncertain. This study conducted detailed laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of straw mulch and straw incorporation on soil erosion and sediment transport of thawed soil. The median particle size (D50) of transported sediment, flow velocity and sediment concentration for thawed soil were compared with that of unfrozen and frozen soil. Models based on Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Back Propagation Neural Network (BP) and stepwise regression (SR) were implemented to simulate the key parameters of thawed soil erosion, and the accuracy of the developed models was evaluated. The results showed that the sediment yield increased significantly in thawed soil compared with that in unfrozen soil. The maximum flow velocity over thawed soil decreased by 20.7 % compared with that over frozen soil. The D50 of transported sediment decreased by 29.4 % after the soil suffered the effects of freeze-thaw, and the finer sizes were more likely to be entrained. The straw mulch effectively reduced the D50 of transported sediment, flow velocity and sediment concentration. In addition, the RF model showed a better result to predict the sediment concentration, flow velocity and D50 of transported sediment (NSE > 0.849, RRMSE < 0.493) than the BP, SVM and SR models. Comparing the performance of the RF model with the models reported in previous studies, the RF model showed the best performance. In general, the results of this study provide important information for soil erosion in thawed soil.

J	Feng, Q; Dong, LY; Liu, JJ; Liu, HH				Feng, Qian; Dong, Linyao; Liu, Jingjun; Liu, Honghu			Detection Framework of Abrupt Changes and Trends in Rainfall Erosivity in Three Gorges Reservoir, China	SUSTAINABILITY												Rainfall erosivity is commonly used to estimate the probability of soil erosion caused by rainfall. The accurate detection of temporal changes in rainfall erosivity and the identification of abrupt changes and trends are important for understanding the physical causes of variation. In this study, a detection framework is introduced to identify temporal changes in rainfall erosivity time series as follows: (i) The significance of time series variation of rainfall erosivity is assessed based on the Hurst coefficient and divided into three levels: None, medium, and high. (ii) The detection of abrupt changes (Mann-Kendall, Moving T, and Bayesian tests) and trends (Spearman and Kendall rank correlation tests) of variate series and the correlation coefficient between the variation component and the original series is calculated. (iii) The modified series is obtained by preferentially eliminating the variation component (trend or change point) with larger correlation coefficients. (iv) We substituted the modified series into steps i to iii until the correlation coefficient was not significant. This framework is used to analyze the variation of rainfall erosivity in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. The results showed that by using traditional methods, both an increasing trend and an upward change point were observed in Zigui station. However, after the upward change point was deducted from the annual rainfall erosivity series R(t), the resultant R-m(t) showed no statistically significant trend. Trend analysis should be performed considering the existence of an abrupt change to assess the long-term changes in rainfall erosivity series; otherwise, it would result in the wrong conclusion. In addition, the change points detected in the R-m(t) varied with the methods. Compared with the single-test method, the proposed framework can effectively reduce uncertainty.						liu, honghu/0000-0001-7837-5257														2071-1050				FEB	2023	15	3							2062	10.3390/su15032062	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15032062													WOS:000931067100001
J	Wang, HH; Yue, C; Luyssaert, S				Wang, Huanhuan; Yue, Chao; Luyssaert, Sebastiaan			Reconciling different approaches to quantifying land surface temperature impacts of afforestation using satellite observations	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Satellite observations have been widely used to examine afforestation effects on local surface temperature at large spatial scales. Different approaches, which potentially lead to differing definitions of the afforestation effect, have been used in previous studies. Despite their large differences, the results of these studies have been used in climate model validation and cited in climate synthesis reports. Such differences have been simply treated as observational uncertainty, which can be an order of magnitude bigger than the signal itself. Although the fraction of the satellite pixel actually afforested has been noted to influence the magnitude of the afforestation effect, it remains unknown whether it is a key factor which can reconcile the different approaches. Here, we provide a synthesis of three influential approaches (one estimates the actual effect and the other two the potential effect) and use large-scale afforestation over China as a test case to examine whether the different approaches can be reconciled. We found that the actual effect (delta T-a) often relates to incomplete afforestation over a medium-resolution satellite pixel (1 km). delta T-pa increased with the afforestation fraction, which explained 89 % of its variation. One potential effect approach quantifies the impact of quasi-full afforestation (delta T-p1), whereas the other quantifies the potential impact of full afforestation (delta T-p2) by assuming a shift from 100 % openland to 100 % forest coverage. An initial paired-sample t test shows that delta T-pa <delta T-p1 <delta T-p2 for the cooling effect of afforestation ranging from 0.07 to 1.16 K. But when all three methods are normalized for full afforestation, the observed range in surface cooling becomes much smaller (0.79 to 1.16 K). Potential cooling effects have a value in academic studies where they can be used to establish an envelope of effects, but their realization at large scales is challenging given its nature of scale dependency. The reconciliation of the different approaches demonstrated in this study highlights the fact that the afforestation fraction should be accounted for in order to bridge different estimates of surface cooling effects in policy evaluation.

(RP) restoration has increased vegetation cover in semi-arid regions on the Loess Plateau of China, but ecological problems have also occurred due to RP restoration, such as reduced soil moisture. Further, it is still uncertain how microbial diversity, composition and assembly processes change with RP restoration in semi-arid regions. Therefore, amplicon sequencing of small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (16S rRNA) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes was performed to study soil bacterial and fungal diversity, composition and assembly processes at four study sites with different stand ages of RP plantations (Y10, RP plantation with stand ages less than 10 a; Y15, RP plantation with stand ages approximately 15 a; Y25, RP plantation with stand ages approximately 25 a; and Y40, RP plantation with stand ages approximately 40 a) along a 40-a chronosequence on the Loess Plateau. The diversity of soil bacteria and fungi increased significantly during the restoration period from 10 to 15 a (P<0.05). However, compared with Y15, bacterial diversity was lower at Y25 and Y40, and fungal diversity remained stable during the restoration period between 25 and 40 a. The relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Ascomycota increased during the restoration period from 10 to 15 a. Conversely, after 15 a of restoration, they both decreased, whereas the relative abundances of Actinomycetes, Acidobacteria and Basidiomycota gradually increased. The variations in soil bacterial communities were mainly related to changes in soil total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and moisture contents, while soil fungal communities were mainly shaped by soil organic carbon and nitrate nitrogen contents. Bacterial communities were structured by the heterogeneous selection and stochastic process, while fungal communities were structured primarily by the stochastic process. The RP restoration induced an increase in the relative importance of heterogeneous selection on bacterial communities. Overall, this study reveals the changes in microbial diversity, community composition and assembly processes with RP restoration on the Loess Plateau and provides a new perspective on the effects of vegetation restoration on soil microbial communities in semi-arid regions.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				MAY	2022	14	5					561	575		10.1007/s40333-022-0064-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-022-0064-2		MAY 2022											WOS:000793610300001

Three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with spikelet nodes per spike (SNS) were mapped in a population of recombinant inbred lines generated from a cross between two advanced breeding lines of winter wheat based on the phenotypic variation evaluated over six locations/years. Two of the three QTLs are QSns.sxau-2A at the WHEATFRIZZY PANICLE (WFZP) loci and QSns.sxau-7A at the WHEAT ORTHOLOG OF APO1 (WAPO1) loci. The WFZP-A1b allele with a 14-bp deletion at QSns.sxau-2A was associated with increased spikelets per spike. WAPO-A1e, as a novel allele at WAPO1, were regulated at the transcript level that was associated with the SNS trait. The third SNS QTL, QSns.sxau-7D on chromosome 7D, was not associated with homoeologous WAPO-D1 or any other genes known to regulate SNS. The favorable alleles for each of WZFP-A1, WAPO-A1, and QSns.sxau-7D are identified and incorporated to increase up to 3.4 spikelets per spike in the RIL lines. Molecular markers for the alleles were developed. This study has advanced our understanding of the genetic basis of natural variation in spikelet development in wheat.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can assist its host plants to effectively mitigate salinity stress. However, less information is available on the molecular mechanisms of AMF related to halophytes in adapting to moderate saline environments. A pot experiment was undertaken to detect the effects of AMF on the carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in the halophyte Suaeda salsa which was grown at 100 mM NaCl and the underlying proteomic modulating mechanisms. The results proved that AMF decreased the N and P concentrations, increased the C, N and P accumulations and the C:N and C:P ratios. Proteomic analysis screened 581 differentially abundant proteins (DAP), which were mostly categorized in carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism and folding, sorting and degradation pathways. The enrichment analysis illuminated that the DAPs were assembled in 'carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms,' 'nitrogen metabolism' and 'N-glycan biosynthesis' pathways, which might be associated with the stoichiometric changes. The integrative proteomic and transcriptomic analysis detected 64 DAP whose regulations were concordant with those of the corresponding differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, these proteins were enriched in 'carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms' and some amino acid metabolism pathways. The modulations of these pathways might be correlated with C and N allocations and plant growth in moderate saline conditions. The study supplements the comprehension of the roles of AMF in halophytes grown in saline ecosystems.

The purpose of this study is to quantify factors that drive the changes in runoff components. Annual runoff data from six hydrological stations in the Weihe River Basin, China and sixteen meteorological stations data from 1961 to 2015 were used. The Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt method were used to diagnose the runoff sequence and detect its abrupt-point. The period before the abrupt-point of annual runoff was taken as the base period (Period I), while the period after the abrupt-point was taken as the calculation period (Period II). The elasticity coefficient of runoff (Q) was deduced based on the Budyko hypothesis, including climate variabilities such as precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (Ep), and the catchment characteristics representing land surface changes (n). The elasticity coefficient was the smallest for Ep ranging from -1.210 similar to -2.847, intermediate for n ranging from -1.602 similar to -2.964, and greatest for P ranging from 2.2103.847. Runoff exhibited a significant downward trend throughout the Weihe River Basin, where the land surface change is the main cause of runoff reduction, accounting for 75% at the largest Linjiacun hydrological station, with the smallest being 40.36% at the Zhuangtou hydrological station. Adaptive water resource management measures are necessary to cope with future environmental change and water resource scarcity.

We investigated the photosynthetic activity, mineral nutrition and metabolomics of the salt-tolerant wild soybean (W2), salt-sensitive wild soybean (W1) and cultivated soybean (C) in the early flowering stage, with a focus on the physiological and cellular metabolism-related differences among Soja to reveal the adaptive mechanisms. The photosynthetic activity of W2 was greater than that of W1 and the Mg, Zn, Mo, Mn and B contents showed the same trend. Carbohydrate, polyol, organic acid and fatty acid contents, as well as the secondary metabolism, were greater in W2 than W1, while the amino acid metabolism was lower in W2 than W1. These levels could minimize damage and maximize survival and growth, which might be the mechanisms that W2 adapts under adverse environmental conditions. The photosynthetic activity of C was greater than that of W1 and C also contained more K, Zn and B. The metabolomics study indicated that carbohydrate and organic acid metabolism were relatively greater, while the amino acid content and secondary metabolism level were lower in C than W1. These were presumably the result of long-term breeding and domestication. This comparative study among Soja will help in increasing the understanding and protection of wild soybean resources, as well as the improvement and utilization of cultivated soybean.

Contemporary catchment monitoring programmes can provide such information, but there is also a need to consider past behaviour. Where long-term records are lacking, attention has been directed to the potential for using the sediment deposits behind check dams to reconstruct the sediment response of the upstream catchment. This contribution reports a study of the 0.181 km(2) Nianyangou catchment located in the hilly region of the Chinese Loess Plateau, in Shaanxi Province, China, which has extended a previous study aimed at using individual flood couplets preserved in the check dam deposits to reconstruct the record of annual sediment yield, to include the use of sediment source fingerprinting techniques to document changes in the annual sediment contribution from inter-gully and gully areas for the period 1960-1990. The sediment response of the catchment provided evidence of two change points in 1964 (Period 1-Period 2) and 1983 (Period 2-Period 3), which reflect the introduction of soil and water conservation measures in the mid 1960s through to the 1970s and a change in the land tenure system in 1983. The annual sediment yields from inter-gully and gully areas follow the trend P1 > P3 > P2, whereas the equivalent information on the relative contribution of inter-gully and gully areas follow different trends P3 > P1 > P2 and P2 > P1 > P3, respectively.						yang, ming yi/0000-0003-2574-552X; Zhang, Fengbao/0000-0003-1003-256X													0885-6087	1099-1085				NOV	2022	36	11							e14754	10.1002/hyp.14754	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14754													WOS:000887410400001

Herein, we investigated the impacts of anthropogenic activities in the Circum-Bohai-Sea (CBS) region in China using correlation analysis between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and indicators related to urban development, agricultural practices, and afforestation efforts; multivariate linear regression and residual analyses were used to quantify how anthropogenic activities contribute to NDVI change. We found that the vegetation cover in most of the study area significantly increased from 1982 to 2015. In major cities, the decrease in vegetation cover was not as expected because of the opposing effects of rapid urbanization and greening. Afforestation and improved agricultural practices dominated the increase in vegetation cover in different regions. Anthropogenic activities accounted for 42% of the increase in vegetation cover in the CBS region. Therefore, to achieve regional sustainable development, the effects of human activities in highly populated area must be heeded.					/J-8497-2013	/0000-0002-5213-4399													1010-6049	1752-0762				DEC 13	2022	37	25					9339	9354		10.1080/10106049.2021.2017016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2021.2017016		DEC 2021											WOS:000730481500001

Finding ways to improve water use efficiency (WUE) has become an urgent task for Chinese agriculture. To understand the response of different maize populations to changes in precipitation and the effects of changes in maize populations on WUE, this study conducted maize population experiments using maize hybrids with different plant types (compact and semi compact) and different planting densities at 25 locations across China. It was found that, as precipitation increased across different locations, maize grain yield first increased and then decreased, while WUE decreased significantly. Analyzing the relationship between WUE and the main climatic factors, this study found that WUE was significantly and negatively correlated with precipitation ((R) over bar (daily mean precipitation) and R (accumulated precipitation)) and was positively correlated with temperature (T-M (daily mean maximum temperature), TM-m (T-m, daily mean minimum temperature) and GDD (growing degree days)) and solar radiation ((Ra) over bar (daily mean solar radiation) and Ra (accumulated solar radiation)) over different growth periods. Significant differences in maize grain yield, WUE and precipitation were found at different planting densities. The population densities were ranked as follows according to maize grain yield and WUE based on the multi-site experiment data: 60 000 plants ha(-1) (P-2)>90 000 plants ha(-1) (P-3)>30 000 plants ha(-1) (P-1). Further analysis showed that, as maize population increased, water consumption increased significantly while soil evaporation decreased significantly. Significant differences were found between the WUE of ZD958 (compact type) and that of LD981 (semi-compact type), as well as among the WUE values at different planting densities. In addition, choosing the optimum hybrid and planting density increased WUE by 21.70 and 14.92%, respectively, which showed that the hybrid played a more significant role than the planting density in improving WUE. Therefore, choosing drought-resistant hybrids could be more effective than increasing the planting density to increase maize grain yield and WUE in northern China. Comprehensive consideration of climatic impacts, drought-resistant hybrids (e.g., ZD958) and planting density (e.g., 60 000 plants ha(-1)) is an effective way to increase maize grain yield and WUE across different regions of China.																			2095-3119					DEC	2021	20	12					3156	3169		10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63428-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63428-1		OCT 2021											WOS:000710198300006

Wet season flood magnitude drives resilience to dry season drought of a euryhaline elasmobranch in a dry-land river	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The increase in severity and occurrence of drought from environmental change poses a significant threat to freshwater ecosystems. However, many of the mechanisms by which periodic drought affects aquatic animals are poorly understood. Here we integrated physical, physiological, and behavioural measurements made in the field over a twelve-year period to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting the loss of body condition of fish in arid rivers, using the Critically Endangered freshwater sawfish (Pristis pristis) in the dry-land Fitzroy River, Western Australia, as a model species. Sawfish lost condition throughout the long dry season in all years and had significantly poorer body condition throughout years characterized by low volumes of wet season flooding and little occurrence of overbank flooding. A mechanistic examination of factors leading to this loss of condition using measurements of body temperature, field energetics, and habitat use from telemetry techniques showed that the loss of condition throughout the season was likely due to substantial habitat compression and lowproductivity in drier years, while high rates of competitionwere more likely to drive this pattern in wetter years.

Addressing the effects of soil organic carbon on water retention in US Pacific Northwest wheat-soil systems	FRONTIERS IN SOIL SCIENCE												Soil organic carbon (SOC) is considered a significant contributor to soil water retention. However, generalizations about the role of SOC in available water-holding capacity (AWHC) may have inaccurately portrayed this relationship. We aim to reexamine the relationship between SOC and water retention using the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) Database. We focus on regional soil groups within the Pacific Northwest wheat production region, including Haploxerolls, Argixerolls, Haplocambids, and Durixerolls. We evaluated 77 sites based on SOC, total nitrogen (TN), pH, texture, bulk density (BD), field capacity (FC), permanent wilting point (PWP), and AWHC. Our findings indicate that texture and BD were the most significant contributors to AWHC variation, while SOC played a secondary role in explaining this variation. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy coupled with a random forest (RF) algorithm was used to evaluate the importance of spectral bands in determining changes in FC and PWP. This analysis identified mineral bands related to inner-surface hydroxyl groups in kaolinite (3700 cm (-1)) and Si-O-Si overtones (1870 cm (-1)) as the most important spectral contributors to PWP. The water retention at FC was associated with organic absorbances relevant to soil aggregation, such as polysaccharide C-O (similar to 1035 cm (-1)), while mineral bands were relatively less influential. This study highlights the need to reexamine the impact of SOC as well as the interaction between soil texture and compaction on soil water retention to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for AWHC, thus providing insight into future drought adaptation strategies.																				2673-8619				AUG 21	2023	3								1233886	10.3389/fsoil.2023.1233886	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsoil.2023.1233886													WOS:001095879200001

In this study, fine soil and coarse sand were refilled to form three layering patterns: Layer-Mix (soil and sand well-mixed), Layer-Thin (8 thin layers interlaid), and Layer-Thick (4 thick layers interlaid). Three doses of C-13-labelled glucose were respectively added to the top, middle, and bottom. The results show that the Layer-Thin and Layer-Thick cumulatively released 62% and 67% less CO2 than the Layer-Mix. The C-13-CO2 contributed 14.1 similar to 60.3% to the total CO2 released from the Layer-Mix, but was only responsible for 7.3 similar to 48.8% of that from the Layer-Thin and 7.0 similar to 37.0% of that from the Layer-Thick. The peaks of delta C-13-CO2 of the two interlaid columns were lowered and lagged by 1 similar to 2 days, but the delta C-13 residue remaining in the soil were on average 3 similar to 6 parts per thousand more negative than that of the Layer-Mix. The C-13-CO2 contributed more to the total CO2 when the glucose was added at the top, but the delta C-13-soil was 3 parts per thousand more negative when added at the bottom. Overall, the lagged outgassing and lower share of C-13-CO2 from the two interlaid columns did not match with the more negative C-13 residue remaining in the soil. Such inconsistency collectively highlights that the interlaid layers did not inhibit the decomposition of C-13-labelled glucose (i.e., potentially abundant CO2 produced), but the low diffusivity of the fine layers significantly impeded CO2 transfer through the heterogeneously structured soil profile.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				2023 OCT 18	2023										10.1007/s10533-023-01086-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-023-01086-z		OCT 2023											WOS:001086378700001

Free-living diazotrophs are vital for soil nitrogen input. However, a comprehensive understanding of how soil free-living diazotrophic communities and their co-occurrence patterns respond to desert wetland degradation is lacking. Here, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), amplicon sequencing targeting nitrogenase gene (nifH), and network analysis were used to investigate the abundance, diversity, community composition, and co-occurrence patterns of soil free-living diazotrophs along the wetland degradation gradient, i.e., non-degraded (ND), lightly degraded (LD), moderately degraded (MD), and severely degraded (SD), in the southeastern Mu Us Desert, northern China. The abundance and Shannon, Simpson, Chao 1, and ACE indexes decreased (P < 0.05) by 14.6%, 20.7%, 2.1%, 46.5%, and 45.0%, respectively, in SD wetland, whereas no significant difference (P > 0.05) was observed between ND and LD wetlands. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria generally decreased (by 53.5%-19.7%) across the different degradation levels, while the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria increased (by 6.2%-40.1%) from ND to MD levels. The abundance, diversity, and community composition of diazotrophs were most strongly related to soil organic carbon, followed by total nitrogen, moisture, and pH. The least number of network nodes and edges and the lowest density were observed for MD and SD wetlands, indicating that the complexity of free-living diazotrophic networks was reduced by continued degeneration. Overall, severe desert wetland degradation affected the abundance, diversity, and network complexity of soil free-living diazotrophs more negatively than light degradation. This degradation promoted the growth of autotrophic diazotrophs and inhibited the growth of heterotrophic diazotrophs. These changes were mostly related to the loss of soil organic carbon.																			1002-0160	2210-5107				AUG	2023	33	4					638	648		10.1016/j.pedsph.2022.07.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pedsph.2022.07.007		AUG 2023											WOS:001067988000001

Thus, whether the acid and non-acid nitrogenous compounds have similar effects on biodiversity and ecosystem functions remains understudied. We mimicked nitrogen deposition with acidic NH4NO3 and (NH4)(2)SO4, and non-acidic urea, slow-released urea and NH4HCO3 in a temperate steppe, and quantified soil microbial taxonomic and functional gene composition with amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics, respectively. Results While NH4NO3 and (NH4)(2)SO4 significantly altered the soil microbial taxonomic and functional composition as well as their carbon decomposition potential, the other three compounds had smaller effects. Conclusion Our results suggested that previous nitrogen deposition experiments mimicked with NH4NO3 or (NH4)(2)SO4 alone may have overestimated the effect on biodiversity and ecosystem functions in the Eurasian steppe and similar ecosystems affected by mainly nonacidic nitrogen deposition.

Conservation management decreases surface runoff and soil erosion	INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Conservation management practices - including agroforestry, cover cropping, no-till, reduced tillage, and residue return - have been applied for decades to control surface runoff and soil erosion, yet results have not been integrated and evaluated across cropping systems. In this study we collected data comparing agricultural production with and without conservation management strategies. We used a bootstrap resampling analysis to explore interactions between practice type, soil texture, surface runoff, and soil erosion. We then used a correlation analysis to relate changes in surface runoff and soil erosion to 13 other soil health and agronomic indicators, including soil organic carbon, soil aggregation, infiltration, porosity, subsurface leaching, and cash crop yield. Across all conservation management practices, surface runoff and erosion had respective mean decreases of 67% and 80% compared with controls. Use of cover cropping provided the largest decreases in erosion and surface runoff, thus emphasizing the importance of maintaining continuous vegetative cover on soils. Coarse- and medium-textured soils had greater decreases in both erosion and runoff than fine-textured soils. Changes in surface runoff and soil erosion under conservation management were highly correlated with soil organic carbon, aggregation, porosity, infiltration, leaching, and yield, showing that conservation practices help drive important interactions between these different facets of soil health. This study offers the first large-scale comparison of how different conservation agriculture practices reduce surface runoff and soil erosion, and at the same time provides new insight into how these interactions influence the improvement or loss of soil health.

Healthy soil is one of the most important pillars of sustainability as it delivers several ecosystem services along with its control on microbial activity, nutrient recycling, and decomposition. Nature-based solutions can play an important role in restoring soil quality for enhanced agricultural productivity and sustainability. This article discusses various nature-based options available for improving soil quality. Indigenous practices such as sheep penning, tank silt application, green manuring, and refuse from croplands and households have the potential to restore and maintain soil fertility. Biofertilizers can add nutrients (N fixers), fixe up to 300 kg N ha through biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) and facilitate (nutrient solubilizer and mobilizers) nutrient availability in the soil. Biochar, a commonly used product, can increase soil moisture availability by 8%-10% and aids in mitigating climate change through C-sequestration. Biochar may have a climate change mitigation potential of 1.8 Pg CO2-C equivalent per year. When added to the soil, it not only acts as a nutrient source; but also acts as a soil amendment. Biogas slurry, the effluent from biogas reactors, contains various nutrient elements that can enrich soil fertility. The holistic approach in a farming system, through integration of different enterprises, reduces dependence on off-farm resources. Soil management through nature-based options will maintain crop productivity and sustainability in the long run without any adverse effects on the environment.

Based on the daily streamflow data of the Zhuangtou Hydrological Station in 1970-2018, this paper analyzes the streamflow changes in the Beiluo River Basin and studies the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the streamflow in this basin. A non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt's test were used to determine the trend and detect abrupt changes of streamflow and baseflow. The method based on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, as well as the double-mass curve of precipitation-streamflow, was established to evaluate the impact of climate change and non-climate factors on annual streamflow. The results reveal a statistically significant downward trend (p = 0.01) in both annual streamflow and baseflow, with the abrupt point year in 1994 and 1988, respectively. When comparing to a modest declining trend in annual average precipitation, we see that the temperature showed a significant upward trend (p = 0.01), whose abrupt point year was 1996. Under the policy of returning farmland to forest, land-use analysis shows that the area of farmland had decreased by 222.4 km(2), of which 31.4% was mainly converted into the forestland. By the end of 2015, the area of forestland had increased by 123.4 km(2), which has largely caused streamflow decrease. For the method based on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, climate change contributed 43.7% of the annual streamflow change, and human activities (mainly refers to LUCC) contributed 56.3%. For the DMC of precipitation-streamflow, the precipitation contributed 9.4%, and non-precipitation factors (mainly refers to human activities) contributed 90.6%, and human activities played a more vital part in driving streamflow reduction in different decades, with a contribution rate of more than 70%. This study is of great practical significance to the planning, management, development and utilization of water resources in basins.</p>																				2073-4441				OCT	2021	13	20							2892	10.3390/w13202892	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13202892													WOS:000714761800001

However, the effects of revegetation-induced changes in soil and root properties on soil resistance to concentrated flow erosion (SRC) remain unclear. This study sampled soils and roots across a 25-year chronosequence from farmland to grasslands of different ages (3, 7, 10, 18, and 25 years) to quantify variations in soil and root properties (soil bulk density, SBD; soil disintegration rate, SDR; saturated hydraulic conductivity, SHC; organic matter content, OMC; water-stable aggregate, WSA; mean weight diameter, MWD; root mass density, RMD; root length density, RLD; and root surface area density, RSAD) and their effects on SRC. Farmland and grassland SRCs were obtained using a hydraulic flume. Soil properties and root density gradually improved with restoration time. In terms of the comprehensive soil property index calculated via principal component analysis, grassland values were 0.66 to 1.94 times greater than farmland values. Grassland SRCs increased and gradually stabilized (>18 years) over time and were 1.60 to 8.26 times greater than farmland SRC. SRC improvement was significantly related to increases in OMC, SHC, WSA, and MWD and decreases in SBD and SDR over time. SRC was effectively simulated by the Hill curve of RMD, RLD, and RSAD. SDR, SHC, and RMD (0.5-1.0 mm) affected SRC the most. This study scientifically describes how revegetation improves soil quality and soil resistance to flow erosion, and suggests that vegetations rich in 0.5-1.0 mm roots should be preferred during revegetation.

However, an evaluation of available methods for analysing this impact is lacking. In this study, we comprehensively reviewed four commonly used quantitative methods: the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, Budyko-based approach, and two empirical methods, i.e., Double mass curve (DMC) and Modified DMC (MDMC). Using the Wei River basin as a case study, we assessed the runoff reduction influenced by climate change and human activities from 1970 to 2017. The results show that human activities are the primary driver for runoff reduction. The highest contribution of human activities was estimated by the DMC (93.2%-99.9%), followed by MDMC and SWAT (65.6%-87.1%), while the Budyko-based had the smallest estimates (55.3%-61.2%). Each method has advantages and limitations, so the appropriate method should be selected based on research objectives and data availability/quality.																			0262-6667	2150-3435				JUL 27	2023	68	10					1358	1371		10.1080/02626667.2023.2218551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2023.2218551		JUN 2023											WOS:001010711100001

In this work, we compared experiments on soil containing residual plastic film with a control experiment to investigate how residual film affects the transportation and distribution of water and nitrate (NO3-) in wetted soil. The experiment used Mariotte bottle, water tube, and soil tank to test six levels of residual-film concentration varying from 0 to 720 kg/hm(2) in the soil. The wetting front, soil water content, and nitrate concentrations were all measured, and the results showed that when the concentration of residual-film was less than 360 kg/hm(2), more water and nitrate remained in the upper part of the wetted volume due to block of residual film. Excessive residues (>360 kg/hm(2)) resulted in obvious phenomenon of preferential flow, which increased the wetting distance, wetted volume, and water content in the lower part of the wetted volume and the concentration of nitrate at the boundary of the wetted volume. These results not only help us to understand the consequences of plastic-film-residues pollution in terms of water and nitrate movement, but also provide scientific support to the development and establishment of reasonable irrigation, fertilization and management systems for polluted farmland with differential mulch residual concentrations.

Based on KOH pore-forming activated biochar (ACB) and K+ doped g-C3N4 (K-gC(3)N(4)), the novel activated biochar-based K-gC(3)N(4) composite (ACB-K-gC(3)N(4)) was synthesized via the innovative ultrasonic-milling method. Rhodamine B (RhB), tetracycline (TC), norfloxacin (NOR), and chloramphenicol (CAP) were selected as target pollutants, and the effects of environmental factors, recycling and actual wastewater tests, disinfection effects, and various enhancement strategies were investigated. The results showed that K-gC(3)N(4) was successfully composited with ACB by various characterizations, where the loading mass ratio of 1:2 exhibited the best performance. ACB-K-gC(3)N(4) possessed a larger specific surface area, richer functional groups, suitable band gap (2.29 eV), and broader visible light absorption (~716 nm) than K-gC(3)N(4). ACB-K-gC(3)N(4) presented effective removal efficiency over K-gC(3)N(4) for four pollutants, in which the removal efficiency of RhB reached 93.26%, and the degradation rate constant of 0.0119 min(-1) was four times higher than K-gC(3)N(4) (0.0029 min(-1)). Moreover, ACB-K-gC(3)N(4) was superior to K-gC(3)N(4) in disinfecting S. aureus and E. coli, with a sterilization rate of exceeding 90% for 12 h. The photodegradation activity was dominated by <bold>center dot</bold>O-2(-), h(+), and <bold>middot</bold>OH, and the mechanisms involved in the three stages. This was attributed to the unique structure and surface properties (defects and persistent free radicals) of ACB, as evidenced by improved adsorption stage and transfer of degradation intermediates, facilitated the generation of active species, accelerated migration of photogenerated electrons, and inhibited photogenerated carriers recombination by the heterojunction. The good reusability and stability, enhancement strategies (blowing air and heating), and satisfactory feasibility for actual wastewater allow ACB-K-gC(3)N(4) possible to promote high-concentration wastewater treatment and disinfection.

J	Li, BB; Wang, YQ; Hill, RL; Li, Z				Li, Bingbing; Wang, Yunqiang; Hill, Robert L.; Li, Zhi			Effects of apple orchards converted from farmlands on soil water balance in the deep loess deposits based on HYDRUS-1D model	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Land use change (LUC) impacts on the soil water balance is important for effective water resources management and land use planning. The Loess Plateau of China has loess deposits up to 350-m depth and constitutes large reservoirs of soil water storage. In recent decades, areas within these reservoirs have been depleted of their water storage. LUC impacts on soil water storage have been previously investigated in this region; however, LUC impacts on other components of soil water balance such as evapotranspiration and deep drainage have received limited study because of difficulties in direct measurement of these components. Using continuously monitored 10-m soil water profiles under farmland and apple orchards converted from farmlands for 10, 20, and 30 years for the period 2011-2013, the HYDRUS-1D model was calibrated and then employed to evaluate long-term LUC impacts on different components of the soil water balance in a typical loess tableland based on climate data for the period 1960-2013. Compared with farmlands and young apple orchards (stand age< 10 years), the measured soil water storage under mature apple orchards (stand age> 20 years) was significantly decreased over time. The simulated deep drainage was 12.1 mm year(-1) under farmland and accounted for 2% of the annual average precipitation, but this value was reduced to near zero under mature apple orchards. The simulated average annual actual evapotranspiration was 565.8 mm and represented 98% of the average annual precipitation under farmlands, but the evapotranspiration was increased under mature apple orchards. The LUC-induced decrease in soil water storage and groundwater recharge threatens the sustainability of water resources and agriculture on the Loess Plateau. The balance between economic development and agriculture ecosystems and environmental sustainability are, therefore, important considerations in future land use planning.

'Merrillii' (Cephalotaxaceae) is a rare nut with a variety of bioactive compounds and a high economic value. & beta;-sitosterol is not only the most abundant plant sterol but also has various biological effects, such as antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities. In this study, a squalene synthase gene from T. grandis, TgSQS, was identified and functionally characterized. TgSQS encodes a deduced protein of 410 amino acids. Prokaryotic expression of the TgSQS protein could catalyze farnesyl diphosphate to produce squalene. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TgSQS showed a significant increase in the content of both squalene and & beta;-sitosterol; moreover, their drought tolerance was also stronger than that of the wild type. Transcriptome data from T. grandis seedlings showed that the expression levels of sterol biosynthesis pathway-related genes, such as HMGS, HMGR, MK, DXS, IPPI, FPPS, SQS, and DWF1, increased significantly after drought treatment. We also demonstrated that TgWRKY3 directly bound to the TgSQS promoter region and regulated its expression through a yeast one-hybrid experiment and a dual luciferase experiment. Together, these findings demonstrate that TgSQS has a positive role in & beta;-sitosterol biosynthesis and in protecting against drought stress, emphasizing its importance as a metabolic engineering tool for the simultaneous improvement of & beta;-sitosterol biosynthesis and drought tolerance.																			1664-462X					JUN 20	2023	14								1136643	10.3389/fpls.2023.1136643	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1136643								37409301					WOS:001018781600001

This study transformed industrial lignin into a lignin-based polyporous carbon@polypyrrole (LPC@PPy) by a hydrothermal-activation-in situ polymerization strategy for removal of reactive blue 19. The hydrothermal reaction and pol-ypyrrole polymerization provide abundant O and N groups, and the pore-making process promotes the even distribution of O and N groups in the 3D pore of LPC@PPy, which is favorable for the adsorption of reactive blue 19. The adsorption capacity of LPC@PPy for reactive blue 19 is 537.52 mg g(-1), which is 2.04 times the per-formance of LPC (only hydrothermal and activation process, only have O groups) and 3.36 times that of LC (direct lignin activation, lack of O and N groups). After 8 cycles, LPC@PPy still maintained a high adsorption capacity of 92.14 % for reactive blue 19. In addition, this study found that N and O groups in the material played an important role in adsorption, mainly pyridinic-N, C-OH, -COOR, -C-O- and C--C. This work provides a new strategy for the removal of reactive blue 19 and determines the groups that mainly interact with reactive blue 19, which provides a new reference for adsorption, catalysis and related fields.																			0141-8130	1879-0003				JUN 1	2023	239								124220	10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.124220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.124220		MAR 2023						37001780					WOS:000968475800001

To control soil erosion, extensive conservation measures aimed at redistributing rainfall, hindering flow velocity and intercepting sediment were implemented on the Loess Plateau. To accurately evaluate the combined effect of conservation measures in the Chabagou watershed, this study classified intra-event-based floods into four regimes via cluster and discriminant analyses. Regime A was characterized by short flood duration and low erosive energy, regime B was characterized by short flood duration and high erosive energy, regime C was characterized by long flood duration and low erosive energy, and regime D was characterized by long flood duration and high erosive energy. The results indicated that peak discharge (q(p)), runoff depth (H), mean discharge (q(m)), and runoff erosion power (E) decreased by 75.2%, 56.0%, 68.0% and 89.2%, respectively, in response to conservation measures. Moreover, area-specific sediment yield (SSY), average suspended sediment concentration (SCE), and maximum suspended sediment concentration (MSCE) decreased by 69.2%, 33.3% and 11.9%, respectively, due to conservation measures. The nonlinear regression analysis revealed a power function relationship between SSY and E in both the baseline (1961-1969) and measurement period (1971-1990) in all regimes. Conservation measures reduced sediment yield by not only reducing the runoff amount and soil erosion energy but also transforming the flood regime, for example, transforming a high-sediment-yield regime into a low-sediment-yield regime. Moreover, conservation measures altered the SSY-E relationship in regime A, whereas no obvious difference in regime B or C/D was observed between the measurement period and the baseline period. This study provides a better understanding of the mechanism of runoff regulation and the sediment yield reduction under comprehensive conservation measures in a small watershed on the Chinese Loess Plateau.																			2045-2322					AUG 2	2021	11	1							15595	10.1038/s41598-021-95111-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95111-6								34341421					WOS:000685192200023

Changes in precipitation patterns can affect the potential runoff generation capacity of the HM-CSNWTP. Therefore, this study was focused on exploring the dynamic precipitation patterns over the HM-CSNWTP and the potential runoff generation capacity of this region at annual and seasonal timescales. Daily precipitation data from 34 meteorological stations for the period 1961?2016 were collected in order to estimate 4 categories of rainfall indices: average daily precipitation on all days (ADP) and on rainy days (ARP), total amount (TP), and rainy days (TD). The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test, LOWESS smoothing, and collaborative kriging method were implemented. The statistical results indicated that: (1) The annual ADP over the basin decreased slightly, at the rate of - 0.22%/10a (-0.002 mm/d/a). Seasonally, summer ADP increased by 1.4%/10a (0.005 mm/d/a), while decreasing ADP values were detected in other seasons. Large increases in annual and summer ARP were found, at rates of 3.73%/ 10a (0.018 mm/d/a) and 3.72%/10a (0.039 mm/d/a), over the HM-CSNWTP, mainly in the southwestern area (Region III), due to the large changes of annual and summer ARP. Annual and summer ARP increased at significant rates of 7.22%/10a (0.034 mm/d/a) and 10.64%/10a (0.083 mm/d/a), respectively. (2) Decreasing light rainfall amounts (TP0-10) and days (TD0-10), and increasing heavy rainfall amounts (TP>25) and days (TD>25) were detected over the HM-CSNWTP, especially for Region III, in which TP>25 and TD>25 increased by 7.00%/10a (1.076 mm/a) and 5.37%/10a (0.023 d/a), respectively. (3) In the wettest assumption scenario, the estimated annual, spring, summer, autumn, and winter runoff depths were 912.9 mm, 183.0 mm, 410.6 mm, 259.0 mm, and 60.3 mm, respectively. In the driest assumption, the estimated annual, spring, summer, autumn, and winter runoff depths were 131.4 mm, 35.6 mm, 65.7 mm, 27.8 mm, and 2.3 mm, respectively, and the planned diversion water accounted for 76.1%, 63.2%, 70.0%, 102.2%, and 156.5% of the annual and seasonal driest assumption runoff depths, respectively. Thus, the water diversion of the M-CSNWTP in the driest assumption may trigger water shortages and environmental disasters in the lower reaches of the Hanjiang River Basin, especially at annual, autumn, and winter timescales. These findings provide some basic information for local water resource management in the HM-CSNWTP.																			0169-8095	1873-2895				JUN 1	2021	254								105392	10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.105392	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.105392		FEB 2021											WOS:000636300300004

Harrison's rule scales up to entire parasite assemblages but is determined by environmental factors	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Harrison's rule states that parasite body size and the body size of their hosts tend to be positively correlated. After it was proposed a century ago, a number of studies have investigated this trend, but the support level has varied greatly between parasite/host associations. Moreover, while the rule has been tested at the individual species level, we still lack knowledge on whether Harrison's rule holds at the scale of parasite and host communities. Here, we mapped flea (parasites) and rodent (hosts) body sizes across Mongolia and asked whether Harrison's rule holds for parasite/host assemblages (i.e. whether a parasite's average body size in a locality is positively correlated with its host's average body size). In addition, we attempted to disentangle complex relationships between flea size, host size and environmental factors by testing alternative hypotheses for the determinants of fleas' body size variation. We gathered occurrence data for fleas and rodents from 2,370 sites across Mongolia, constructed incidence matrices for both taxa and calculated the average body sizes of fleas and their hosts over half-degree cells. Then, we applied a path analysis, accounting for spatial autocorrelation, trying to disentangle the drivers of the correlation between parasite and host body sizes. We found a strong positive correlation between average flea and host size across assemblages. Surprisingly though, we found that environmental factors simultaneously affected the body sizes of both fleas and hosts in the same direction, leading to a most likely deceptive correlation between parasite and host size across assemblages. We suggest that environmental factors may, to a great extent, reflect the environmental conditions inside the hosts' burrows where fleas develop and attain their adult body size, thus influencing their larval growth. Similarly, rodent body size is strongly influenced by air temperature, in the direction predicted by Bergmann's rule. If our findings are valid in other host-parasite associations, this may explain the dissenting results of both support and lack thereof for Harrison's rule.

We postulated that without effective hydraulic regulation plants would permanently restrain water loss and photosynthetic productivity under salt stress conditions. We compared wild-type tomatoes to a transgenic type (TT) with impaired stomatal control. Gas exchange activity, biomass, starch content, leaf area and root traits, mineral composition and main stems xylem anatomy and hydraulic conductivity were analyzed in plants exposed to salinities of 1 and 4 dS m(-1) over 60 days. As the xylem cannot easily readjust to different environmental conditions, shifts in its anatomy and the permanent effect on plant hydraulic conductivity kept transpiration at lower levels under unstressed conditions and maintained it under salt-stress, while sustaining higher but inefficient assimilation rates, leading to starch accumulation and decreased plant biomass, leaf and root area and root length. Narrow conduits in unstressed TT plants were related to permanent restrain of hydraulic conductivity and plant transpiration. Under salinity, TT plants followed the atmospheric water demand, sustained similar transpiration rate from unstressed to salt-stressed conditions and possibly maintained hydraulic integrity, due to likely impaired hydraulic regulation, wider conduits and higher hydraulic conductivity. The accumulation of salts and starch in the TT plants was a strong evidence of salinity tolerance via osmotic regulation, also thought to help to maintain the assimilation rates and transpiration flux under salinity, although it was not translated into higher growth.

An important example is the effect that vegetation restoration may have in reducing surface water resources. After searching peer-reviewed articles, we selected 38 publications from 16 countries in comparable areas - semiarid conditions (aridity index <0.5), surface coverage >50% and fine soil texture - to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of vegetation (i.e., forestland, scrubland and grassland) in regulating runoff and sediment transport. In particular, we used three indices: the runoff reduction effect, the sediment reduction effect and the ratio between runoff and sediment reduction. These indices were calculated from measured data reported in the original articles. Results showed that scrubland had higher runoff reduction effect (59% in gentle slopes; 65% in steep slopes) than in grassland (39% on gentle slopes; 43% on steep slopes) and forestland (33% on gentle slopes; 51% on steep slopes). For the three types of vegetation, the sediment reduction effect was >70%. Concerning the ratios between runoff and sediment reduction, grassland showed the lowest ratios (56% on gentle slopes; 53% on steep slopes) compared to forestland (63% on gentle slopes; 65% on steep slopes) and scrubland (93% on gentle slopes; 81% on steep slopes). Our results indicate that low values of ratios between runoff and sediment reduction are the most suitable because they indicate an effective soil erosion and sediment delivery reduction but maintaining surface runoff. Overall, our study demonstrates that grassland may be the best choice for optimizing the trade-off between catchment water yield and soil conservation during the implementation of ecological restoration programs in semi-arid regions.

However, whether these recovered carbons are stable is yet largely uncertain. Thus, we determined the sequestration and stability of SOC in soils with three different types (Caragana korshinskii (CA) aged for 10, 20, 36, and 47 years, Hippophae rhamnoides (HR) aged for 5, 10, 20, and 30 years, and Robinia pseudoacacia (RP) aged for 5, 10, 20, 37, and 56 years) to compare their SOC sequestration and stability in different depths in this study. The SOC content, SOC stock, very labile fraction of oxidizable carbon (C1), labile fraction of oxidizable carbon (C2), and carbon management index (CMI) in 0-30 cm depths of the three types increased over the chronosequence. The SOC stocks increased by 1.40-3.19 Mg ha(-1) in CA during the 47-year restoration, by 5.76-10.01 Mg ha(-1) in HR during the 30-year restoration and by 1.88-8.93 Mg ha(-1) in RP during the 56-year restoration, respectively, in 0-30 cm depths. The carbon stability index (SI) in 0-10 cm depth of CA, 0-30 cm depths of HR, and 0-50 cm depths of RP decreased with recovery time. Over the recovery time, SOC content, SOC stock, CMI, and SI were lower than those of nature forest (NF aged more than 100 years) in all restored sites at the later stage of recovery. SOC sequestration decreased, but its stability increased, with the soil depths. Overall, HR had a higher SOC sequestration rate and lower SI (0-30 cm) than CA and RP. Our results revealed that although the SOC sequestration appears enhanced over the restoration, but the SOC stability becomes lower, so that the recovery of these site to the level of NF may meet difficulties in this semiarid Loess Hilly Region.

Nevertheless, how microbial necromass carbon (C) concentrations and their contributions to SOC sequestration change from litter to mineral soil and what factors influence its accumulation remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a field experiment to investigate the compositional distribution characteristics of microbial necromass C and its contributions to SOC sequestration in an oak forest (Quercus wutaishanica) litter-mineral soil profile of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The present study estimated the microbial necromass C concentrations based on the microbial cell wall's biomarker amino sugars. Our results demonstrated that microbial necromass C increased from the Oi1 to Oa layers but decreased from the Ah1 to AB horizons. The highest accumulation of microbial necromass C was found at the litter-mineral soil interface (i.e., total microbial necromass in the Oa layer was 39.5 Mg ha(-1), and Ah1 was 22.8 Mg ha(-1)). The contribution of total microbial necromass C to SOC increased from Oi1 to Ah2. Specifically, the total microbial necromass C accounted for 40.7%, 47.7%, and 37.0% of the average bulk SOC in the Ah1, Ah2, and AB horizons of the oak forest mineral soil, respectively. The ratio of fungal to bacterial necromass C decreased from litter to mineral soil, indicating that the relatively higher bacterial necromass C increasingly accumulated in the deeper litter layers and upper mineral soil horizons. Fungal and bacterial necromass C increased with increasing labile organic C, nitrogen (N), and labile inorganic phosphorus (P), suggesting that higher easily accessible soluble nutrients lead to higher microbial biomass levels, which in turn lead to higher microbial necromass accumulation. Overall, our findings suggested that microbial demand for C or N influences the quantity of soluble nutrients and further lead to changes in microbial necromass C decomposition/accumulation.

Non-thermal discharge plasma (NDP), an advanced oxidation technique, has received great attention in soil remediation. Potential impact of NDP treatment on microbial community structures and enzymatic activities in uncontaminated soil samples was evaluated in this study. The NDP treatment significantly altered soil microbial community structures and enzymatic activity. The exposure of soil samples to NDP decreased the enzymatic activities including glutamic acid enzyme, arylsulphatase, leucine enzyme, acetyl glucosaccharase, glucosaccharase, cellulose, phosphatase, and ligninase. The contents of some soil microbes including Gram-negative bacteria, Fungi, Anaerobes, AM Fungi, Eukaryotes, and Actinomycetes also decreased after NDP treatment, as well as the diversity index and equitability index of the soil microbes. In addition, the total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA), Fungi PLFA, bacteria PLFA, and Actinomycetes PLFA of the soil microbes were also reduced after treatment. Principal component analysis confirmed these changes. Actinomycetes and Fungi were the most sensitive microbes to the NDP, and Phosphatase activity and Cellulose activity were relatively insensitive to the NDP. The potential impacts could be attributed to chemically active substances and ultraviolet irradiation.																			0304-3894	1873-3336				JUL 5	2020	393								122489	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122489	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.122489								32193134					WOS:000532829200110

Most existing methods estimate the impact of climate change on the vulnerability of species by projecting the change of a species' distribution range. This single-component evaluation ignores the impact of other components on vulnerability. In this study, Populus davidiana (David's aspen), a tree species widely used in afforestation projects, was selected as the research subject under four future climate change scenarios (representative concentration pathway (RCP)2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). Exposure components of range change as well as the degree of fragmentation, degree of human disturbance, and degree of protection were considered simultaneously. Then, a multicomponent vulnerability index was established to assess the effect of future climate change on the vulnerability of P. davidiana in China. The results show that the distribution range of P. davidiana will expand to the northwest of China under future climate change scenarios, which will lead to an increased degree of protection and a decreased degree of human disturbance, and hardly any change in the degree of fragmentation. The multicomponent vulnerability index values of P. davidiana under the four emission scenarios are all positive by 2070, ranging from 14.05 to 38.18, which fully indicates that future climate change will be conducive to the survival of P. davidiana. This study provides a reference for the development of conservation strategies for the species as well as a methodological case study for multicomponent assessment of species vulnerability to future climate change.

Inherent livelihood diversity may lead to differences in household behavior in the adoption of SNM practices, thus challenging policy interventions uniformly implemented. This study aims at exploring the responsive heterogeneity in household behavior in the adoption of fertilizer use by farmers. Determinants of fertilizer uses were analyzed across different farm types. These farm types were identified from farm-household data collected in six villages in the South Western of Burkina Faso using the Sustainable Livelihood Framework. Using multilinear and binary logistic models, determinants of mineral, organic and combined mineral-organic fertilizer uses were analyzed. The results revealed that the determinants of SMN adoption include not only common determinants to whole sampled population (income, household size, access to roads and cereal areas), but also specific determinants to farm types (small ruminants, animal power, educational level and access to agro-training). This finding suggests that policy interventions will not be effective if the responsive heterogeneity in SNM adoption behavior is not taken into account. The study recommends the use of the presented framework, as an approach, to identify functional farm types to be considered in SNM policies.

Culture-dependent analysis of seed bacterial endophyte,<i>Pseudomonas</i>spp. EGN 1 against the stem rot disease (<i>Sclerotium rolfsii</i>Sacc.) in groundnut	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL												Background Groundnut,Arachis hypogaeaL., crop is an important oil seed crop in India and is prone to attack by numerous fungal and viral diseases, among the soil-borne diseases, stem rot caused bySclerotium rolfsiiSacc. is economically important. Main body of abstract Incidence (86.6%) of the stem rot disease was recorded in Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu, India, during the roving survey. For its management, an attempt was made to isolate bacterial endophyte from peanut seeds of different groundnut cultivars by culture-dependent analysis. Totally, 16 bacterial endophytes (endophytes groundnut (EGN) 1 to EGN 16 along with standards TNAU-Pf1 and EPC 5) were obtained and characterized through morphological, biochemical and molecular studies and also phytostimulation activities were performed. Among the isolates, EGN 1 and EGN 4 showed positive results for indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophore, phosphate solubilization and protease tests in vitro. The dual culture analysis showed inhibition rates of 60.1% (dual plate assay), 68.23% (filter paper disc assay) and 100% (triangle method of streaking and culture filtrate assay) for EGN 1 againstS.rolfsii. Further, the crude metabolite assay showed 97.7% inhibition in EGN 1, followed by 87.7% in EGN 4. The roll towel study showed a high vigour index of 4286.7 in EGN 1; hence, this isolate was chosen. Further, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis showed various bands at 0.72R(f), whereas GC-MS analysis indicated the prominent peaks of hexadecanoic acid and cis-vaccenic acid that may responsible for antifungal activity. In a molecular approach, the genomic DNA of EGN 1 strain was used to amplify a 1200 bp PCR-fragment and sequenced. Short conclusion The overall outcome of this study showed thatPseudomonasspp. EGN 1 had a great potential as a bio-stimulant and biocontrol agent to manage effectively the stem rot in peanut.

To this end, 1977-2019 Landsat satellite imagery, the DEM, and a high-resolution orthophotomap were used, and detailed geomorphological mapping was carried out. The results show that the present-day position of the terminus of the studied glacier results from a surge that occurred before 1947. Currently, the glacier is losing mass. However, despite the visible characteristics of its thawing, the extent of the terminal zone has remained stable for several decades. Outside the glacier, there are no glacial landforms. This indicates that advances of surging glaciers may not create any surge-diagnostic features in their forefields. On the other hand, the genesis and interactions of landforms can reveal glacier surge, even in the absence of terminal and lateral glacial landforms.

Based On the Principal Coordinate Analysis	PHILIPPINE JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE												Investigation of genotypes for their yield stability under various environments is important issue in plant breeding programs. Yield stability of 16 barley (Hordeum vulgar L.) genotypes was tested across four locations and three years. The analysis of variance showed that genotype (G), environment (E), and their interaction (G x E) were significant for barley yield. The presence of a large G x E interaction magnitude indicates a significant problem of related to phenotypic expression and makes it difficult for decision making in selection. According to means of environments and total general mean yield (3446.9 kg ha-1), test environments are grouped as H (six high yield) and L (five low yield). The identified most stable genotypes with static stability concept and based on the minimum spanning tree plots and centroid distances were G5 with 3165.4 kg ha(-1) and G16 with 3191.7 kg ha(-1), and therefore could be recommended for unfavorable or poor conditions. Also, genotypes G5 (3165.4 kg ha(-1)), G13 (3119.1 kg ha(-1)) and G16 (3191.7 kg ha(-1)) were located several times in the vertex positions of high cycles according to the principal coordinates analysis. Therefore, genotypes G5 and G16 were found to be the most stable genotypes in both favorable and the favorable conditions and are recommended for commercial release. The principal coordinates analysis provided useful and interesting way of investigating GE interaction of barley genotypes. Finally, the results of principal coordinates analysis in general confirmed the breeding value of the genotypes, obtained on the basis of the yield stability evaluation.																			0115-463X					APR	2023	48	1					34	40																WOS:001068572100006

Temperature driven development of the rice brown planthopper, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> (Stal) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae)	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY												Temperature driven development of rice brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) population (biotype 4) was examined at seven constant temperatures (15, 18, 20, 25, 30, 32 and 35 C). Complete development of BPH from egg to adult was observed at constant temperatures ranging from 15 to 32 C with linear development observed till 30 C. Total immature developmental duration decreased from 74.4 days at 15 C to 22.4 days at 30 C. Linear and non-linear models fitted to describe developmental rates of life stages as a function of temperature, gave estimates of bioclimatic thresholds (lower, optimum and upper temperature thresholds). Thermal constants estimated from Campbell linear model for egg, nymph and cumulative immature development to adult were, 198.8, 275.5 and 473.9 degree days, respectively. Among empirical non-linear models, Lactin 2 model was selected for estimates of upper temperature threshold at 35 degrees C based on higher coefficient of determination. Application of thermodynamic SSI model explained the observed nonlinear relationship of development of BPH life stages at temperatures higher than 30 degrees C. The estimated thermal constants and bioclimatic thresholds were used in developing temperature dependent phenology model based on Campbell equation. Phenology model predicted closely the occurrence of different life stages of BPH with those observed under field conditions.																			0972-1665					JUN	2019	21	2					131	140																WOS:000476576500002

In this study, we contribute to a better understanding of the ecosystem and farm-level economic impacts of no-till, with Buchanan County in the northeastern region of the U.S. State of Iowa as the backdrop due to previously established data and model validation efforts in that region. Using the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) and Farm Economic Model (FEM), we simulated two tillage scenarios-a conservation tillage baseline and no-till-for continuous corn and corn-soybean rotations in Buchanan County using gridded historical climate data. We find that no-till provides clear ecosystem benefits, except that soluble nutrient losses might actually rise. We also find that under current commodity prices for corn and soybeans, no-till is not as profitable as the conservation tillage baseline. For no-till to be at least as profitable as the baseline under current commodity prices, the yield penalty associated with no-till cannot be higher than 1.5% for corn and 0.8% for soybeans, or similar combinations that entail a revenue penalty of about $24,000 for an 809-hectare continuous corn or corn-soybean operation. Given the simulated yield penalties associated with no-till, corn and soybean prices would have to be substantially lower in order for no-till to break even. Consequently, incentives for conservation practice implementation may need to be tied to commodity prices and yield penalties in order to elicit greater adoption rates.

The succession was formed by a wandering river with minor preservation of proximal floodplain muds. The frequent occurrence of mud intraclasts reflects significant input of eroded material from underlying, older successions. The ages of 13 authigenic Be-10/Be-9 dating samples formed three groups: (1) samples from below the base of the river terrace yielded dates of similar to 4.13-3.70 Ma (including uncertainties); (2) muddy intraclasts from the river terrace gave an age range of similar to 2.79-1.96 Ma; and (3) in situ muddy layers had ages in the range of similar to 1.91-1.39 Ma. The large mammal fossil assemblage from channel thalweg deposits yielded a biostratigraphic age of similar to 3.6-2.2 Ma, matching the age of intraclasts, and thus emphasising the redeposited origin of those fossils. The relatively wide range of authigenic Be-10/Be-9 dating ages is interpreted as a result of the redeposition of mud from older strata on three scales: decimetre-scale intraclasts, millimetre-scale rip-up clasts mixed into the newly formed beds, and formation of two authigenic rims with different age and Be-10/Be-9 records around individual particles. Considering these observations, an age range of in situ layers of similar to 1.91-1.39 Ma is proposed as the depositional age of the river terrace, with the most probable age falling within the most recent part of this interval. The effect of redeposition is thus shown to be potentially limiting to the application of authigenic Be-10/Be-9 dating to incising rivers, and stands in marked contrast to aggrading river settings, where redeposition of older sediments is limited and the degree of Be-10/Be-9 variability is low.

Here, we detect the spatial coverage and type of wetlands at 10 m resolution across southern Nigeria (total area: 147,094 km(2)), thought to be one of the most wetland-rich areas of Africa. We use Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery supported by 1500 control points for algorithm training and validation. We estimate that the swamps, marshes, mangroves, and shallow water wetlands of southern Nigeria cover 29,924 km(2) with 2% uncertainty of 460 km(2). We found larger mangrove and smaller marsh extent than suggested by earlier, coarser spatial resolution studies. Average continuous wetland patch areas were 120, 11, 55 and 13 km(2) for mangrove, marsh, swamp, and shallow water respectively. Our final map with 10 m pixels captures small patches of wetland which may not have been observed in earlier mapping exercises, with 20% of wetland patches being < 1 km(;)(2) these were clustered around urban centres, suggesting anthropogenic wetland fragmentation. Our approach fills a knowledge gap between very local (< 400 km(2)) studies reliant on field studies and aerial photos, and low resolution (> 250 m pixel dimensions) global wetland datasets and provides data critical for both improving land-surface climate models and for wetland conservation.

The NUE of the harvested grain (NUEHG), calculated using the difference method (difference between fertilized and non-fertilized [control] experimental units), was 49, 46, 35, and 29% for the annual N fertilizer applications of 67, 132, 196, and 246 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively during the 2006 to 2018 growing seasons. The system N loss (difference between N inputs and outputs) from N-fertilized treatments, calculated using an N balance from fall 2005 to fall 2018 that included N changes in the 0 to 120 cm soil depths, ranged from 19% with the 67 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) rate to 57% with the 246 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) rate. The data suggest that nitrate (NO3-N) leaching and atmospheric emissions could be pathways for these losses. The changes in soil N content were negative, with an average system N loss across fertilized treatments of 15 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) of soil organic N (SON) in the top 30 cm of soil of the fertilized and non-fertilized treatments. These results show that even no-till systems could potentially have significant net N loss, including a reduction in SON and particulate organic N (POM-N), and that higher N use efficiencies found using the system N balance (NUESys) approach indicate that the NUEHG does not accurately assess the N lost to the environment.

However, straw incorporation has been a challenge under a cold and dry climate due to slow decomposition. This field study was to use a novel approach to incorporate corn straw into the soil during the fall season with a plastic film cover in an effort to enhance the straw degradation, soil water use efficiency, and corn growth and yield. Two-year field experiments were conducted in northeast China to investigate the effects of four treatments on soil properties and corn growth: (1) straw incorporation with film cover, (2) straw incorporation only, (3) film cover only, and (4) control. Soils and corn plants were collected during the growing season and analyzed for soil temperature and moisture, straw degradation, corn biomass, grain yield, and water use efficiency. Results indicated that straw incorporation with film cover increased grain yield by 53% as compared to straw incorporation only and by 102% to control. The straw decomposition under film cover was 20% faster, significantly higher than that of the straw incorporation treatment. In all cases, soil water content before planting, corn water uptake, and corn water use efficiency under straw incorporation with film cover were significantly higher than straw incorporation and control. Surface film cover resulted in 10-day earlier corn tasseling in compared to treatments without film cover. This field study demonstrated that straw incorporation with film cover would enhance straw degradation in soil, improve soil properties, and increase corn yield and water use efficiency, which could be potentially used as a sustainable soil management practice in northeast China.

The 1-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was computed for 30 years (1989 to 2018) to quantify the precipitation deficit/surplus regions and assess its influence on vegetation dynamics. The growing season mean NDVI and VCI were correlated with growing season mean 1-month SPI of dry (2003) and wet (2007) years to analyze the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics. The correlation analysis between SPI and NDVI for dry year (2003) showed strong positive correlation (r= 0.89). Analysis of VAI for dry year (2003) indicates that the central, western, and south-western parts of the district reported high vegetation stress with VAI of less than - 2.0. This might be due to the fact that central and south-western parts of the district are more prone to droughts than the other parts of the district. The correlation analysis of SPI, NDVI, and VCI distinctly shows the impact of rainfall on vegetation dynamics. The study clearly demonstrates the robustness of NDVI, VCI, and VAI derived from time-series MODIS data in monitoring the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics and delineate vegetation stress zones in tropical arid ecosystem of India.

Present study was attempted to evaluate the suitability of InfoCrop v2.1 model for prediction of growth, development and yield of wheat crop at farmers' fields using two years data i.e. 2015-16 & 2016-17. A total of 42 farmers' fields were selected in Pataudi block of Haryana state. The large variability in wheat sowing date (1-Nov to 25-Dec), seed rate (87 to 150 kgh(-1)), N application rate (70 to 195 kgha(-1)) and number of irrigations (5-8) were observed in farmers' field. InfoCrop model could able to predict well days to anthesis and physiological maturity within an acceptable error of 5% (RMSE-3 days). Measured leaf area index (LAI) matched well with simulated LAI (RMSE similar to 0.5). The agreement between observed and model simulated wheat grain yield was found to be satisfactory (nRMSE similar to 6-8%).

Integrated transcriptome, small RNA and degradome sequencing approaches provide insights into Ascochyta blight resistance in chickpea	PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL												Ascochyta blight (AB) is one of the major biotic stresses known to limit the chickpea production worldwide. To dissect the complex mechanisms of AB resistance in chickpea, three approaches, namely, transcriptome, small RNA and degradome sequencing were used. The transcriptome sequencing of 20 samples including two resistant genotypes, two susceptible genotypes and one introgression line under control and stress conditions at two time points (3rd and 7th day post inoculation) identified a total of 6767 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These DEGs were mainly related to pathogenesis-related proteins, disease resistance genes like NBS-LRR, cell wall biosynthesis and various secondary metabolite synthesis genes. The small RNA sequencing of the samples resulted in the identification of 651 miRNAs which included 478 known and 173 novel miRNAs. A total of 297 miRNAs were differentially expressed between different genotypes, conditions and time points. Using degradome sequencing and in silico approaches, 2131 targets were predicted for 629 miRNAs. The combined analysis of both small RNA and transcriptome datasets identified 12 miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs that exhibited contrasting expression in resistant and susceptible genotypes and also, a subset of genes that might be post-transcriptionally silenced during AB infection. The comprehensive integrated analysis in the study provides better insights into the transcriptome dynamics and regulatory network components associated with AB stress in chickpea and, also offers candidate genes for chickpea improvement.

In the experiment, 12 non-weighing large lysimeters were used to measure cotton water use under various irrigation modes. Then a micro-lysimeter was placed in each large lysimeter to monitor soil evaporation (E). Adjustments were done for a number of factors (including irrigation, meteorology, plastic mulching, water stress and salinity stress) in order to compare FAO-adjusted K-c(Kc-FAO) with the local actual K-c (Kc-loc). The results showed that: 1) plastic mulching with 0.6 cover ratio and 37.5 mm drip irrigation quota gave a crop water requirement of 536.4 mm; which was suitable for the study area. Also ic.105 were respectively 0.28, 0.97 and 0.31 for early, middle and late growth stages. 2) Kc-FAO generally reflected the trend in Kc-loc for the entire growing season. The suggested 0.1 adjusted coefficient under plastic mulching for the initial growth stage was relatively low, and was most rational for the study area when increased to 0.25. 3) E/ET ratio was low (19.1-24.5%) under mulching treatment and relatively high (27.7-32.7%) under non-mulching treatment. 4) While change in E/ETo ratio was linear or logarithmic, that in T/ETo ratio was a power function of the canopy cover. Also the two rates responded to the interaction effects of canopy cover and soil water content. The results could lay the basis for developing scientific, data-driven water-saving strategies in the study area and elsewhere.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				APR 15	2019	236						85	95		10.1016/j.fcr.2019.03.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2019.03.008													WOS:000467664500009

This study examined the food safety standards followed by street-food vendors in two large cities of India, Hyderabad and Delhi in 2017 after the introduction of the Food Safety and Standards Rules. A survey was conducted in different socioeconomic groups among 200 street-food vendors to understand the compliance and practice of food safety standards in India. Only about one-third of the street-food vendors had registered to run food-vending shops, and most street-food vendors are not following basic food safety principles like wearing apron, access to tap water, were not able to use soap for cleaning utensils, and many did not have refrigerators to store food. The results show that vendors in high-income localities with higher education levels and duly registered were following more safety standards. From a policy perspective, the results show that India's food safety standards are on a par with those of most developed countries, but that their actual implementation by street-food vendors is not duly assured. To avoid this situation, an exchange of experiences between street-food vendors and consumers should be promoted. "Clean street-food clubs" should be encouraged as one mechanism to recognize street vendors' needs and to learn from consumers' demands, so that the awareness of street-food vendors towards food safety standards is strengthened.

It is amenable for pulp, pencil, packaging and plywood production. It has been widely cultivated by farmers in the southern states and to some extent in the central and North Indian states. It is the most promising agroforestry tree species suited for mixed, block and boundary plantations with biomass production of 80-250 t ha(-1) from 4 to 8 years of planting. The economic profitability is Rs 24,000-137,500 per acre per year in different parts of the country. Under the scenario of shifting the momentum of farmers towards assured income-generating commodities like agroforestry, M. dubia is proving highly beneficial to them in terms of monetary and other livelihood opportunities.																			0011-3891					JUN 25	2022	122	12					1451	1454																WOS:000820673600014

Spatial and temporal assessment of climate impact on agriculture in plateau region, India	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY												Using large-scale district-level data, the study examined the impact of climate change on crop yields during the period 1966-2011 and predictsthe likely changes in yield sacross agro-climatic zones in Plateau Region. The future projections reveal that by 2080s, cotton yield is expected to decline by 7.18 percent in Western Plateau & Hills.By the end of the century, sorghum yield is projected to decline up to 19 percent in Central Plateau & Hills and increase by 18 percent in Western Plateau & Hills. Under midterm period, rapeseed & mustard yield is likely to reduce by 3.44 percent in Western Plateau & Hills. By 2050s maize yield is expected to reduce by 3.33 percent in Central Plateau & Hills. By 2080s, wheat yield is projected to decline by 5.44, percent in SouthernPlateau & Hills. The results suggest that impact of climate change on crop yield varies across regions, hence it is pertinent to formulate adaptation strategies and farm practices suitable to the crop and location specific needs that mitigate the likely exposure of food production and livelihoods to climate variations.																			0972-1665					SEP	2020	22	3					353	361																WOS:000595378000014

In order to evaluate the carbon storage changes of tree, soil, and litter, and the soil total nitrogen (STN) in two typical artificial forests in the region, we conducted plot surveys for different ages of both artificial forest types. Soil samples were collected at different depths from 0-100 cm. The results indicated that forest ecosystem carbon storage increased with tree development. The rates of mean annual carbon sequestration of Pinus tabulaeformis and Robinia pseudoacacia plantation ecosystems were 3.31 and 3.53 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The rate of mean annual carbon sequestration of R pseudoacacia plantation ecosystems was higher by 6.65% than that of P. tabulaeformis plantation ecosystems. The soil organic carbon (SOC) and STN decreased at deeper soil depths in both plantations at different stand ages, significantly decreasing in the 0-60 cm of soil (P < 0.05), and the highest SOC content and storage were in the top 0-20 cm of soil. The temporal patterns for SOC and STN changes at different soil sampling depths from 0 to 100 cm all showed an initial decrease during the early stage of restoration, and then an increase that coincided with the development of the two plantation forests. At 0-100 cm depth, the SOC storage was in the range of 40.95-106.79 and 45.13-113.61 Mg ha(-1) for the P. tabulaeformis forest and R. pseudoacacia forest, respectively. The STN storage in the 0-100 cm soil layer with the stand age development ranged from 4.16 to 8.34 Mg ha(-1) in the R. pseudoacacia plantation and 4.19-7.55 Mg ha(-1) in the P. tabulaeformis forest. The results showed a significant positive correlation between SOC and STN. This study suggests that we should pay more attention to changes in soil carbon and nitrogen sequestration during long-term vegetation restoration.																			2167-8359					SEP 18	2019	7								e7708	10.7717/peerj.7708	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7708								31579599					WOS:000486372700005

Among the many factors affecting orange fruit quality, tree age and harvesting season are crucial once; however, the factors remained unmapped. Thus, this study was aimed to explore quality of orange fruit due to differences in tree age and harvesting season. Three trees age groups (young = 10 to 16, moderate = 20 to 27 and old = greater than 30 years) grown at Gunda Gundo monastery and its surroundings, northern Ethiopia and are harvested in October and December. The physico-chemical and antioxidant contents were characterized during two consecutive years (2017-2018). R software (R version 3.6.2) was used for the analysis. The highest single fruit weight of 218.71 g, peel thickness (3.6 mm) and pH (3.73) were obtained from young tree age in 2017. Total soluble solid of 13.4 degrees Brix was recorded from moderate tree age in 2017, while 13.3 degrees Brix was recorded from older trees of October harvest in 2018. High rag mass of 41.78% in October of 2017 and 38.04% in December of 2018 harvest were obtained from fruits of young trees. High vitamin C (53.95 mg 100 ml(-1)) and total sugar (11.1%) from the young trees; the highest juice mass (52.04%) from moderate trees age; and the highest phenolic content (9.15 mgGAEg(-1)), iron-reducing power (54.2 mgAAEg(-1)), total antioxidant (26.55 mgBHTg(-1)) and lower DPPH EC50 value (1.5 mg ml(-1)) from fruits of older tree were obtained. This experimental study results show that old trees age had high antioxidant activity.

Agriculture development-based mapping of agro-ecological sub-regions and its implications for doubling farmers' income in India	CURRENT SCIENCE												Prioritizing and targeting less developed regions is one of the multi-pronged strategies for doubling farmers' income (DFI) in India. Using an indicator approach, the present study assessed and mapped agro-ecological sub-regions (AESRs) based on ten indicators representing production, infrastructure, information, marketing and income of the farmers. On the basis of the composite index of agriculture development, AESR 9.1 and AESR 1.1 were found to be the most and the least developed regions respectively. Further, the potential districts for each of the less-developed AESRs have been identified for greater prudency in planning. The study concludes that for achieving the target of DFI within the stipulated time-frame, it is imperative to mainstream AESR-based planning in technological development and dissemination. The evidences revealed large and equitable response of the efforts targeted towards less-developed regions.

Abdel			ENHANCING GROUNDWATER RECHARGE WITH SAND DITCHES	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE												Localized and artificial groundwater recharge is an important water management strategy in arid regions. However, artificial recharge is limited by the hydraulic characteristics of surface soil which control downward water percolation to the aquifers. In heavy soils with low infilfration and hydraulic conductivity rate, water percolation can be enhanced by constructing deep ditches filled with highly permeable materials, such as sand. Laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the effect of constructing a deep sand ditch across the slope of a soil box (50 x 20 x 25 cm(3)) on runoff and deep percolation to the drainage outlet of the soil box. A sandy loam soil packed in two bulk densities (1200 and 1500 kg/m(3)) was used for the experiments. The experiments were carried out using simulated steady runoff of about 300 mL/min for a duration of 60 min. Experimental results showed that sand ditches greatly enhanced water deep percolation in soils but their relative effect was more profound in compacted high-density soil compared to soil having low-density. The drainage water collected from compacted soil boxes in the presence of sand ditches increased by 10 times compared to control soil without sand ditches. In the case of low-density soil, the presence of sand ditches eliminated the runoff but the increase in drainage water was about 18% compared to control. The experimental results clearly revealed that creating high infiltration zones within the soil matrix, such as sand ditches, significantly increased water deep percolation and herewith groundwater recharge in drylands, especially in heavy soils.

However, the duration of this effect of NTS during the fallow period in different cropping systems and different precipitation types is unclear. Therefore, a 12-year field experiment of two tillage methods (NTS; and conventional tillage, CT), in three cropping systems (winter wheat monoculture, WW; spring maize monoculture, MM; and winter wheat-spring maize rotation, WM) were conducted to evaluate the effect of NTS on grain yield, precipitation storage, soil water status, soil evaporation rate and cumulative soil evaporation during the fallow period in different precipitation types. Additionally, the duration for which NTS reduced soil evaporation was calculated using the linear-platform model. Our results showed that compared to CT, NTS increased precipitation storage by 35.3, 47.1 and 53.5 mm under WW, by 31.5, 31.5 and 40.4 mm under MM and by 53.2, 30.2 and 50.3 mm under WM in the wet, normal and dry fallow periods, respectively, at depths of 0-200 cm. As a result, the soil water storage at sowing was higher under NTS than that under CT. The linear-platform model showed that NTS was effective in reducing soil water evaporation for 86, 95 and 126 days under WW, 87, 81 and 110 days under MM, and 95, 104 and 121 days under WM in wet, normal and dry fallow periods, respectively. Additionally, we found that there was a large amount of cumulative soil water evaporation after the abovementioned durations in MM and WM. The path analysis indicated that NTS improved grain yields indirectly by reducing cumulative soil evaporation and increasing the soil water status at the sowing stage. Capturing precipitation when the fallow period is > 125 days may further improve yield.					li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023; Li, June/JEF-1173-2023; wang, zhenhui/JMQ-0550-2023; Zhang, Yihao/JGM-3514-2023; wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023; LI, XIAO/JCE-6169-2023; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022; liu, kaiyuan/JHU-0258-2023; Wang, Xuezhen/IUN-6267-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; LIU, HAO/JBI-9623-2023; wang, chen/JED-7289-2023; yang, xu/JMP-5558-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023; wang, xiaoyu/HJP-6901-2023; zhang, yue/JAC-3705-2023; Chen, Shuo/JEO-6350-2023; Li, Zilong/JEZ-8642-2023; Ma, Xiaodong/JAN-7473-2023; lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023; zhang, xueying/JMB-7808-2023; wang, wei/JBS-7400-2023; Jiang, Yuan/JED-3759-2023; wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023														0167-1987	1879-3444				OCT	2022	224								105504	10.1016/j.still.2022.105504	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2022.105504		AUG 2022											WOS:000861295300002

However, quantitative information about the successive development of interrill-rill-ephemeral gully erosion on hillslopes is still rare. In this study, rare earth elements (REEs) were employed as tracers to monitor the successive development of different erosion processes on a hillslope. Ten different REE oxides were individually mixed with cultivated loessial soil from farmland on the Loess Plateau of China. The ten tagged soils were packed in ten layers into a flume (5 m in length, 1 m in width and 0.7 m in depth with a 20 gradient). Simulated rainfall events with natural rainstorm intensities of 60-and 90-mm h-1 were conducted, and each rainfall intensity event contained three subevents that lasted for 135 mm rainfall depth for each subevent. The runoff and sediments for each test were collected at the outlet of the flume at 4.5-minute and 3-minute intervals, respectively. The flow velocity, flow depth and width and depth of the main channel were also synchronously measured. The results showed that the hillslope erosion went through five evolutionary stages: interrill erosion, rill development, stabilized rill, ephemeral gully development, and stabilized ephemeral gully. These stages were quantitatively identified according to the changing contribution rates of the interrill, rill and ephemeral gully areas. The channel width always developed faster than the depth at both the 60 mm h(-1) and 90 mm h(-1) rainfall intensities. The hydrological parameters could greatly explain the channel evolution and particle size changes. A larger flow power of 90 mm h(-1) intensified the channel morphology evolution in the early development stage. The friction coefficient finally remained steady and the W/D ratio eventually approached a stable value of approximately 2 in the stabilized ephemeral gully stage. Selective erosion occurred in the transportation processes were gradually weakened due to rapid increase of flow power and the overall detachment of the large clods in the channel, as manifested by particle size distribution in sediments approaching primary particle size distribution with time. This study is helpful for deeply understanding hillslope erosion processes, especially the successive evolution of interrill-rill-ephemeral gully.					Elbasit, Mohamed A. M.

Size, growth and mortality of riverine golden perch (<i>Macquaria ambigua</i>) across a latitudinal gradient	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Effective fisheries management requires fish size, growth and mortality information representative of the population and location of interest. Golden perchMacquaria ambiguais long lived, potamodromous and widespread in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia. Using a sample spanning 13 river systems and 10 degrees of latitude, we examined whether the maximum size of golden perch differed by latitude and whether growth and mortality varied between northern and southern MDB regions. The length, weight and age ranges of golden perch sampled (n = 873) were 52-559 mm, 2-3201 g and 0+ to 26+ years respectively, and maximum length and weight were unaffected by latitude. Length and age-length distributions represented by age-length keys varied by region, with greater variability in age-at-length and a larger proportion of smaller individuals in northern MDB rivers, which generally exhibit greater variability in discharge. Growth and mortality rates were similar between regions, and an MDB-wide von Bertalanffy growth model (L-infinity = 447,k = 0.32 and t(0) = -0.51) and instantaneous mortality rate (Z = 0.20) best described the data. An MDB-wide length-weight equation also provided the best fit (W = 6.76 x 10(-6) L-3.12). Our data suggest that the MDB can be treated as one management unit in terms of golden perch maximum size, growth and mortality parameters.

Some governments have started regularizing rights for privately owned land, but this is complex to implement in pastoral areas where resources are used and managed collectively. Our aim was to assess how the scale of communal land tenure recognition in pastoralist systems may affect tradeoffs among objectives such as tenure security, flexibility, mobility, and reduction of conflicts. We used a participatory scenario-building approach to investigate alternative scenarios of land tenure recognition in southern Ethiopia where a new communal land tenure system is in the early stages of implementation. Through key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and a workshop, respondents analyzed the likely outcomes of communal land tenure recognition at different scales. Our findings suggest that there is a good chance of success when the tenure policy is embedded onto customary structures. All scales have some shortcomings, but Reera seems best, yet pastoralists preferred the Dheeda which despite its challenges, is the best for maintaining flexible mobility. There are multiple uncertainties and complexities, which suggest the for multi-pronged approaches and various support mechanisms when implementing a formal land tenure system in these areas.

A two-year field experiment was conducted to explore the effects of plastic film mulching on soil water storage, consumption, water use efficiency, and wheat yield. Three treatments, including no fertilizer or mulching (CK), chemical fertilizer (F) and combined chemical fertilizer and plastic film mulching (FM), were applied. The results showed that compared with CK and F, FM increased soil water storage in the 0-200 cm layer by 0.90-1.35% and 0.57-1.23% in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018, respectively. In addition, mulching was conducive to increasing soil water storage in the 0-100 cm soil layer, especially in the 0-40 cm soil layer, while reducing water storage in the deeper soil layers. Furthermore, in the normal year, mulching could reduce soil water consumption and increase the rainfall utilization ratio. In addition, mulching increased wheat yield and water use efficiency.

However, the factors that control PF during infiltration are not fully understood, especially in the data-scarce high and cold mountainous areas, where few studies have been focused on PF. We selected eight soil moisture observation stations in the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin (HRB), Northwest China. During the growing season from 2014 to 2019, the soil moisture was monitored every 30 min at 5 depths (5, 15, 25, 40, and 60 cm) at each station in order to analyze the occurrence and spatial-temporal control of PF in a cold, mountainous environment. According to the difference in response time of shallower and deeper soil moisture to rainfall, infiltration events were classified into PF and matrix flow. Our results show that the frequency of PF events across all layers of these stations ranged from 0 to 22.28%. As depth increased, the average PF frequency gradually decreased, but the coefficient of variation of PF frequency increased. The effect of vegetation on the occurrence of PF was profound, because vegetation affects root distribution and fauna activities, which affects the occurrence of PF. Our results also show that the frequency of PF gradually decreases from scrubland, to grassland and meadow, and barren land. Low bulk density, low residual water content, high saturated hydraulic conductivity, and high soil organic carbon were found to be conducive to the occurrence of PF. In addition, we found that PF possessed a high degree of seasonal variability because of its strong dependence on soil moisture, rainfall and vegetation conditions. High rainfall was conducive to PF occurrence. In areas with high sand content, low initial soil moisture was conducive to PF occurrence (likely due to hydrophobicity), whereas high initial soil moisture was conducive to PF occurrence in areas with low sand content. Overall, vegetation, soil properties, and water conditions seem to jointly affect the factors that occur in spatial-temporal of PF, and the influence of initial soil moisture on PF varies across different sand content. Findings of this study reveal the occurrence and control factors of PF, which will improve our understanding of water cycling related to the infiltration process, recharge process and the runoff generation process at hillslope over the cold mountainous areas.					tian, jie/ABD-4663-2021; He, Chansheng/A-3337-2008	tian, jie/0000-0002-4845-5085; He, Chansheng/0000-0001-7748-0485													0022-1694	1879-2707				APR	2022	607								127528	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127528	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127528		FEB 2022											WOS:000790827500007
J	Yuan, RQ; Chang, LL; Niu, GY				Yuan, Ruiqiang; Chang, Liling; Niu, Guoyue			Annual variations of T/ET in a semi-arid region: Implications of plant water use strategies	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Understanding the annual variation in the transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio (T/ET) remains a challenge and is essential for a thorough understanding of plant responses to the changing environment. We obtained the annual dynamics of T/ET in a semi-arid area of the southwestern United States based on the medians of monthly T/ET derived from two ET partitioning methods. The variation in monthly T/ET was analysed, and plant water use strategies were discussed based on the water use efficiency evaluated by the transpiration (WUE_T). The results show that physiological changes in plants are vital in the annual dynamics of T/ET. Switches in plant physiological status (growth and dormancy) at the start and end of growing seasons induce two dramatic changes in T/ET. Consequently, there is an annual bimodal dynamic of monthly T/ET, with a maximum of 0.84 in October and a minimum of 0.14 in December. Physiological/biochemical variations of plants indicated by solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) are linearly related to T/ET in growing seasons at a monthly scale (T/ET = 3.40 x SIF + 0.36, R-2 = 0.987). Generally, a stable high monthly T/ET occurs under sufficient energy and water conditions and a highly variable monthly T/ET occurs under energy and water deficient conditions. In semi-arid regions, plants can flexibly adjust WUE_T following different water use strategies to survive or gain as much gross primary productivity (GPP) to compete. Saving water by greatly elevating WUE_T is the main strategy by which plants survive the non-growing season when WUE _T is linearly related to SIF (WUE_T = -114.93 x SIF 3.25, R-2 = 0.970). However, GPP and not WUE-T, becomes the goal of plants in growing seasons when they employ a stable and moderate WUE_T (around 2.1 gC kg(-1)H(2)O) despite the abundant energy and precipitation. There are obvious reductions in WUE_T during the transition periods of the plants' growth-dormancy' cycle. Our study highlights the importance of studying annual T/ET variations and water-use efficiency dynamics to better understand water use strategies in plants.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2021	603		B						126884	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126884	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126884		SEP 2021											WOS:000706318300002
J	Cartwright, I; Morgenstern, U; Hofmann, H; Gilfedder, B				Cartwright, Ian; Morgenstern, Uwe; Hofmann, Harald; Gilfedder, Benjamin			Comparisons and uncertainties of recharge estimates in a temperate alpine catchment	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Determining recharge rates is critical for understanding and managing groundwater systems. This study compares recharge rates estimated using different methods in a temperate catchment (the Ovens Valley, southeast Australia). A catchment water balance yields recharge rates of 110-410 mm yr(-1), with the range reflecting uncertainties in evapotranspiration and the fraction of river water that represents surface runoff. The water table fluctuation method yielded recharge rates of 177-1296 mm yr(-1) with a median estimate of 518 mm yr-1. Residual moisture in the unsaturated zone, which lowers the effective specific yield, probably results in this method overestimating recharge rates. Recharge rates estimated from chloride mass balance are also variable (5-712 mm yr(-1)) with a median value of 285 mm yr(-1). Most uncertainties in those estimates arise from uncertainties in the mass of Cl exported directly by surface runoff. Recharge rates calculated from H-3 activities using the well-mixed reservoir (renewal rate) model are 11 to 480 mm yr(-1) with a median estimate of 159 mm yr(-1). The lower recharge rates calculated from H-3 may be due to the presence of older water in zones of restricted flow in the aquifers. Additional uncertainties in this technique arise from assumptions in the H-3 input function and having to estimate the depth of the active recharge zone at the top of the aquifer. The wide range of recharge rate estimates from methods based on individual groundwater samples may also reflect spatially heterogeneous recharge, which creates difficulties for determining representative recharge rates. The Ovens catchment is typical of many globally in that recharge rates are estimated using infrastructure and data that were not specifically intended for that purpose. The catchment water balance and chloride mass balance are based on abundant commonly-available data and probably yield reasonable estimates of recharge in this and similar temperate catchments.

In this study, we fractionated the bulk SOM into particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) in deposit profiles trapped by check dam on the Chinese Loess Plateau and then attempted to explore the sources and chemical compositions of the POM and MAOM fractions by combining physical fractionation with elemental, isotopic, and spectroscopic analyses. The results showed that the main C source of deposited SOM from upland soils varied with soil fractions. The primary contributor of the POM fraction in deposited sediments originated from grassland and the gully's contribution was minimal, whereas the cropland was the main contributor to the MAOM fraction and the lowest contribution was from forest. The relative enrichments of delta 13C and delta 15N and the lower C/N ratio in the MAOM fraction indicated that it had undergone more microbial processing than the POM had. Moreover, the specific peak data of Fourier Transform Infrared spectra (FTIR) demonstrated that there were higher proportions of the labile functional groups (i.e., alcohol C-OH/C-NH, polysaccharide C-O, and aliphatic C-H) than the recalcitrant functional group (i.e., aromatic C--C/C--N) in the POM fraction in entire deposit profiles. The poor relationships between 13CSOC and log-transformed SOC in different soil fractions further confirmed a lower decomposition rate of MAOM compared to the POM. The results indicate that the POM fraction might have a faster SOM biogeochemical cycling than the MAOM fraction in buried sediments. Our results provide important implications for accurately estimating the nature and persistence of the deposited OM retained by check dams.

For improving the rainfed crop yields in the drought-prone environments, understanding the seasonal patterns of drought events in the target environments is crucial. This study applies the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator) crop model to interpret drought stress impact on a check genotype (early-maturity genotype) and mid- and late-maturity genotypes in 69 sites and 16 climate classes with climate data from over 37 years representing the rainfed wheat agro-ecosystems in Iran. Four drought patterns were recognized across the 16 regions. Water stress was dominant during grain filling (41 %) and around flowering (56 %) in studying regions. This stress varied over different genotypes and climate classes. Furthermore, results showed that under current management practices and using the check genotype, about half of the regions in the rainfed wheat agro-ecosystems of Iran (-1.7 million ha) are frequently subject to severe drought patterns (50 %) resulting in a loss of grain yield of -2 t ha-1. Replacing a common genotype with an extra early-maturity genotype, however, reduced by 44 % the occurrence of severe drought patterns which simultaneously increased the occurrence of light-moderate drought stress (i.e. DP1 and DP2) in the warm regions. In general, planting the extra early-maturity genotype had the advantage of producing higher yields in the driest regions. Sowing this genotype reduced the variability in grain yield and the frequency of severe drought patterns in the warm regions. On the contrary, in rainy and cold regions, the best-yielding genotypes were those with a longer growth period. Therefore, in rainy and cold regions with light-moderate stress conditions, the breeders should focus on earlymaturity and mid-maturity genotypes. Besides, it is suggested that the late-maturity genotype should be used in rainy regions with a reduced risk of drought stress.

Farmers' perception and economic impact assessment of agromet advisory services in rainfed regions of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY												All India Coordinated Research Project on Agrometeorology (AICRPAM) of ICAR has started the micro-level Agromet Advisory Service (AAS) through its 25 cooperative centers across the country. Microlevel advisory based on weather forecast is the newer dimension of the AAS in the country. Studies on economic impact of these micro-level advisories are uncommon. Therefore, the present study was conducted using the field survey to assess the farmer's perception and economic impact of micro-level AAS in Vijayapura and Anantapur centers on pilot basis. Two groups i.e. AAS and non-AAS farmers, consisting of 40 farmers in each group were selected through multi-stage stratified random sampling technique. The probit regression model was employed to assess the factors influencing willingness to pay (WTP) for AAS. Majority of farmers (65%) rated micro-level AAS as 'very good' on scale of 'very poor' to 'very good'. Majority of non-AAS farmers were aware about micro-level AAS but lagged in adopting the service. It needs further detailed investigation of underlying causes of not adopting the service. Farming experience, education, land holding size and income were found to be most important factors influencing the farmer's willingness for pay-based services. Results of economic impact revealed that there was 12 to 33 per cent increase in profit for AAS farmers as compared to non-AAS farmers.

Soil contains various C and N fractions that have diverse chemical and physical characteristics, and they can be used as sensitive evaluation indicators for the change in soil C and N content; however, N application's effects on the deep soil layer N and C fractions of the North China Plain remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the changes in content, percentage, and sensitivity of N and C fractions under four N fertilization application rates in the upper 200 cm soil layer since 2012. N and C fractions in soil layers respond differently to N enrichment. For grain yield, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total nitrogen (TN) contents, the sensitivity index (SI) of N fractions was the highest at N applications of 180 and 240 kg ha(-1). SOC and TN are most active in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The SI of most C fractions in the topsoil layer were not the highest, and the SI of the N fractions was higher in the middle soil layer. Obvious leaching during the application of 300 kg ha(-1) of N fertilizer was indicated by the nitrate content. Under the experimental conditions, the 180 and 240 kg N ha(-1) applications proved to be the best for stabilization of C and N and improved crop productivity.						zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310													1085-3278	1099-145X				MAY 15	2021	32	8					2540	2553		10.1002/ldr.3910	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3910		MAR 2021											WOS:000626538700001

Turcicum leaf blight (TLB) is a major foliar disease that can cause more than 50% yield losses in maize. Considering this, the molecular diversity, population structure, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) for TLB resistance were studied in 288 diverse inbred lines genotyped using 89 polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. These lines werescreened for TLB disease at two hot-spot locations under artificially inoculated conditions. The average percent disease incidence (PDI) calculated for each genotype ranged from 17 (UMI 1201) to 78% (IML 12-22) with an overall mean of 40%. The numbers of alleles detected at a locus ranged from twoto nine, with a total of 388 alleles. The polymorphic information content (PIC) of each marker ranged between 0.04 and 0.86. Out of 89 markers, 47 markers were highly polymorphic (PIC >= 0.60). This indicated that the SSR markers used were very informative and suitable for genetic diversity, population structure, and marker-trait association studies.The overall observed homozygosity for highly polymorphic markers was 0.98, which indicated that lines used were genetically pure. Neighbor-joining clustering, factorial analysis, and population structure studies clustered the 288 lines into 3-5 groups. The patterns of grouping were in agreement with the origin and pedigree records of the genotypesto a greater extent.A total of 94.10% lines were successfully assigned to one or another group at a membership probability of >= 0.60. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed highly significant differences among populations and within individuals. Linkage disequilibrium for r(2) and D ' between loci ranged from 0 to 0.77 and 0 to 1, respectively. A marker trait association analysis carried out using a general linear model (GLM) and mixed linear model (MLM), identified 15 SSRs markers significantly associated with TLB resistance.These 15 markers were located on almost all chromosomes (Chr) except 7, 8, and 9. The phenotypic variation explained by these loci ranged from 6% (umc1367) to 26% (nc130, phi085). Maximum 7 associated markers were located together on Chr 2 and 5. The selected regions identified on Chr 2 and 5 corroborated the previous studies carried out in the Indian maize germplasm. Further, 11 candidate genes were identified to be associated with significant markers. The identified sources for TLB resistance and associated markers may be utilized in molecular breeding for the development of suitable genotypes.					kumar, ravi/HPH-9508-2023; KUMAR, KRISHAN/HTM-4843-2023; Choudhary, Mukesh/AAS-7109-2021	KUMAR, KRISHAN/0000-0003-3474-6188; Choudhary, Mukesh/0000-0003-2828-4829; dar, zahoor/0000-0001-7584-8477; kumar, pardeep/0000-0003-3814-8177														2073-4425				APR	2022	13	4							618	10.3390/genes13040618	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes13040618								35456424					WOS:000785438900001

However, their potential for assessing soil restoration under revegetation has been neglected in temperate arid and semiarid areas. This study examined the characteristics of soil nematode communities and their relationships with soil physicochemical properties under five typical revegetation approaches in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. The results showed that planting an artificial Caragana korshinskii forest led to the recovery of the soil food web, which significantly increased soil nematode abundance (138.10 +/- 11.60 inds./100 g dry soil) and community diversity (Shannon-Wiener diversity: 2.48 +/- 0.13; trophic diversity: 3.08 +/- 0.02), associated with the high contents of SOC and NH4+-N. However, establishing an artificial Prunus sibirica forest improved neither soil properties nor nematode community characteristics, reflecting poor soil ecosystem restoration. After establishing an artificial Prunus davidiana forest (PD) and an artificial Medicago sativa grassland (MS), substantial increases in herbivorous and fungivorous nematodes were observed, respectively, likely due to the accumulation of particular genera that fed on roots (e.g., Pratylenchus) or their symbiotic fungi (e.g., Tylencholaimus), which might result in the deterioration (in MS) or restoration (in PD) of the soil food webs. Natural grassland restoration greatly improved soil properties (i.e., SOC, NH4+-N, microbial biomass carbon) but did not change the nematode community obviously, probably due to top-down predation in natural habitats. In conclusion, the characteristics of nematode communities can effectively indicate the restoration of soil food webs and identify their possible driving forces under revegetation, which have important implications for vegetation restoration in arid and semiarid regions.

Consequently, thinning is discussed as an important management approach to conserve water resources and to maintain plantation forestland sustainability. Here, we explored the effects of thinning intensity on semiarid forest production and soil water supply. Three artificial forests of Populus cathayana with an age of 15 yr were selected and thinned with different intensities [1/3 amount of trees removed (T-1/3), 2/3 amount of trees removed (T-2/3), and using no thinning (NT) as a control]. Results showed that thinning presented a significant impact on the above-ground three-dimensional structure of planted forests and increased forest gaps. Meanwhile, the rainfall redistribution pattern changed significantly. Thinning increased throughfall (T-1/3, 43% +/- 9%; T-2/3, 79% +/- 18%), reduced stemflow (T-1/3,T- -44 +/- 2%; T-2/3, -71% +/- 2%), and increased the soil water replenishment (T-1/3, 34% +/- 7%; T-2/3, 64% +/- 19%) of forest land. Meanwhile, the dead root channel caused by thinning effectively increased the water infiltration rate and groundwater replenishment, and effectively reduced soil water deficit (T-1/3, 41% +/- 33%; T-2/3,T- 57% +/- 33%). Through trade-off analysis, we found that non-thinning aboveground biomass yields were the highest, and T-2/3 yields higher water yield, while T-1/3 can maintain acceptable aboveground biomass while keeping better soil water. We conclude that thinning increased soil water supply, reduced soil water deficit and maintained forestland sustainability, and there are synergies of thinning on forest production and soil water supply through rainfall redistribution for maintaining the sustainability of semiarid plantation forestlands.

A total of 4906 observations from 94 peer-reviewed publications related to soil water changes to a depth of 500 cm in planted forests, planted shrublands, natural grasslands and croplands were synthesized, and two regional-scale evaluation criteria, the stable field capacity (SFC) and the permanent wilting point (PWP), were developed by digitizing the map data. The results indicated that (1) compared with cropland, revegetation more severely depleted the deep soil water availability, and planted forest revegetation resulted in the most serious depletion; (2) the extent of soil water changes was influenced significantly by the tree species planted; Platycladus orientalis was better able to maintain the deep soil water availability than Robinia pseudoacacia and Pinus tabuliformis; (3) the soil water status worsened with time after restoration, particularly at 20 years after restoration; (4) contrary to expectations, deep soil water depletion in forests and shrublands even increased in areas of high rainfall zones (>550 mm) compared to drier zones.; and (5) natural restoration (i.e., grasslands) was a better option than revegetation due to the resultant higher, more stable soil water availability. These results indicate that changes in deep soil water availability must be considered when planning revegetation initiatives.

During the past decades, a significant infestation pattern was observed between these broomrape species with no scientific peer-reviewed explanation. A two-year pot experiment simulating the crop rotation and an independent hydroponic experiment were performed to address the problem and indicate the main reason behind the differential infestation pattern. Different varieties of three crops (sugar beet, pepper, and wheat) were grown in rotation with tomato and sunflower to identify a crop-rotation induced control mechanism on these two broomrape species. Germination bioassays were performed in vitro to identify stimulation of plant biochemicals collected as methanolic shoots/roots extracts and root exudates on the germination patterns of broomrape seeds. Results indicated that sunflower broomrape soil seed banks reduced during the two-year crop rotation; however, Egyptian broomrape seed banks did not alter and the resulting parasitism significantly reduced tomato growth. Seed germination bioassays confirmed that the methanolic shoot/root extracts successfully stimulate sunflower broomrape seeds germination but fail to stimulate Egyptian broomrape seeds germination. Root exudates collected from hydroponically grown crops also confirmed differential germination patterns in both broomrape species. Current results are of vital importance to explain the control effect of a crop rotation system and moreover, lay the foundation to study the genetic evolution of broomrape species that results in their differential germination responses to natural stimuli.

However, the effects of natural restoration on the concentration and allocation of GRSP differ for different soil aggregate sizes, and how size further affects SOC and soil N restoration, and stabilization of SOC and soil aggregates is not well understood. Here, we present the first characterization of the distribution of GRSP fractions and soil nutrients in soil aggregates following natural restoration by choosing fields of 0, 7, 12, 17, 22, 32 years after cropland abandonment, and a natural grassland as reference. GRSP concentration increased most in microaggregates after 32 years of natural restoration. The processes of rapid accumulation of GRSP (22 to 32 years) occurred simultaneously with the formation of macroaggregates, reduction of microaggregates, and rapid increase of mean weight diameter (22 to 32-years). The soil aggregate stability and contents of GRSP, SOC, labile carbon, total N and phosphorus in each soil aggregate fraction significantly increased in the late stage of natural restoration (22 to 32 years). The most recalcitrant carbon fraction in microaggregates significantly increased between 7 and 32 years (0.887 g kg(-1)). Our study suggests that abandoning farmland is effective for the restoration of GRSP, soil nutrients and structure and that microaggregates promote the accumulation of recalcitrant carbon and increase the stability of SOC largely through its ability to retain GRSP.

This accumulation has become a serious environmental issue, as it threatens life of earthworms, inhibits the enzyme activities and microbial diversity, and contributes to the loss of soil microbial carbon and nitrogen. However, little information is available regarding the effects of pesticides on soil dissolved organic matter (DOM). It is also unknown how plastic debris, especially small-sized particles called micro plastics, influences the effects of pesticides on soil DOM. In this study, we performed a 30-day soil incubation experiment. Three levels of the common herbicide glyphosate were applied to soil: 0 (control, CK), 3.6 kg ha(-1) (G1) and 7.2 kg ha(-1) (G2). We also tested four levels of glyphosate and microplastics (homopolymer polypropylene powder) co-addition: 3.6 kg ha(-1) + 7% (w/w) (M1G1), 3.6 kg ha(-1)+ 28% (w/w) (M2G1), 7.2 kg ha(-1) + 7% (w/w) (M1G2), and 7.2 kg ha(-1)+ 28% (w/w) (M2G2). Glyphosate addition slightly increased soil fluorescein diacetate hydrolase (FDAse) and phenol oxidase (PO) activities. Although the glyphosate addition significantly promoted the accumulation of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) within the first 14 days, the M2 treatment decreased DOP at day 30. M2G1 and M2G2 increased soil FDAse activity and promoted the accumulation of DOC and DOP relative to G1 and G2 respectively while M1G1 and M1G2 benefited DON accumulation. Our results highlighted that the interaction between glyphosate and low microplastics content negatively affected DOC and DOP dynamics, leading to the loss of bioavailable C and P loss. The interaction between glyphosate and high content microplastics negatively affected DON compared with glyphosate addition, possibly decreasing DON.

J	Huang, X; She, DL				Huang, Xuan; She, Dongli			Nonlinear relationships of runoff and sediment yield with natural and anthropogenic factors at event scale	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Understanding how natural and anthropogenic factors affects the watershed runoff and sediment yield at event scale can provide useful insights into watershed hydrological processes to guide watershed management. This article investigates the nonlinear relationships between natural and anthropogenic factors and event runoff and sediment yield with a boosted regression tree (BRT) model for 38 watersheds within the Loess Plateau in China during 2006 to 2016. The BRT model captures the relative importance of each natural and anthropogenic factors to the variability in runoff and sediment yield. The results show that these relationships are complex and highly nonlinear. The event runoff was most related to NDVI in the grass land (NDVI_g), with a 21.3% contribution, followed by 3-day antecedent precipitation index (AP3), 10-day antecedent precipitation index (AP10), precipitation (P), and 7-day antecedent precipitation index (AP7). For event sediment yield, the strongest factor is AP3, with contribution of 33.3%, followed by P, NDVI in the forest land (NDVI_f), AP7, and NDVI in the crop land (NDVI_c). The marginal effect curves produced by the BRT are often characterized by thresholds. For instance, NDVI_f has the greatest effect on event sediment yield reduction when NDVI_f = 0.42, suggesting that a very intense green coverage is not necessary to achieve maximal soil erosion control. Vegetation coverage and meteorological factors can explain 54.7% of event runoff variation and 55.6% of event sediment yield variation. Our study identify the nonlinear relationships between runoff and sediment yield with vegetation cover and meteorological factors and provide scientific support for the planning of subsequent reforestation projects in the Loess Plateau.

Water-deficit conditions suppressed plant growth, chlorophyll contents, leaf vascular bundle area, leaf phloem area and leaf midrib thickness, root diameter, root cortex thickness, stem diameter, stem vascular bundle area and stem phloem area. In contrast, water stress caused an increase in leaf proline, hydrogen peroxide, activities of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase enzymes, leaf bulliform cell area, leaf adaxial epidermis thickness, leaf sclerenchyma thickness, root metaxylem area, root epidermis and endodermis area, root stelar diameter, stem sclerenchyma thickness and stem epidermis thickness. However, exogenous application of proline significantly improved the plant growth, leaf proline contents, metaxylem area, mesophyll thickness, root diameter, root cortex thickness, root epidermis, endodermis thickness, stelar diameter, metaxylem area, stem diameter, stem vascular bundle area, stem epidermis area, stem phloem area and stem sclerenchyma thickness. Overall, foliar spray of proline was effective in improving drought stress tolerance which can be attributed to proline-induced significant modulations in physio-biochemical and anatomical features of oat plants.

Grazing can influence root traits directly through trampling and foraging, or indirectly by changing soil characteristics. In the present study, a grazing experiment that involved combinations of grazing season (from June to September) and intensity (rest, moderate and heavy) was conducted in steppe rangeland, Inner Mongolia, China to investigate how the root traits of Leymus chinensis respond to different grazing regimes in the case of aboveground miniaturisation after long-term overgrazing. Root traits such as root length, root surface area, specific root length, root tissue density, root links (unbranched parts of a root connecting either a tip and a branching point or two branching points) and root topological structure were scanned and analysed using Win-RHIZO image analysis software. The results showed that the size of L. chinensis plants was reduced in response to overgrazing, typically by a smaller plant height, total root length, root surface area, root volume, number of tips and number of links. However, root diameter and link length, branching angle and topological structure (herringbone or dichotomous) were unaffected by grazing. Most root traits showed strong correlations under moderate grazing intensity, but not under heavy grazing, indicating that grazing changed the relationships among root traits. Relationships between plant height and root traits (total root length and number of links) shifted from positive to negative as grazing intensity increased, and the trade-off between aboveground and belowground traits was an important adaptive strategy of L. chinensis under heavy grazing. Decreasing grazing intensity in the late grazing season could benefit plant recovery, and a rest in the early grazing season would mitigate root and shoot damage.																			1036-9872	1834-7541					2019	41	4					313	322		10.1071/RJ18099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RJ18099													WOS:000487036500003

However, only a limited number of studies have been published on the dominant factors that impact soil aggregate stability and their associated effects on nutrient distribution for different size soil aggregates under long-term grazing prohibition management. In this study, we investigated variation in soil aggregate stability and nutrient distribution characteristics in semiarid grassland sites under different grazing prohibition time frames (0 years [GP0], 11 years [GP11], 26 years [GP26], and 36 years [GP36]). Results showed that organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in soil aggregates decreased at GP11 before progressively increasing and reaching its highest value at GP36, and the total phosphorus (TP) concentration did not change significantly. Most nutrients accumulated in macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm) under grazing prohibition, and the nutrient stoichiometry in soil aggregates increased after 26 years. Compared to the control (GP0), the mean weight diameter (MWD) value of the soil stability index increased at GP11 (21.7%) and decreased at GP26 (18.9%). Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) also showed that the proportion of stable organic C-related functional groups (i.e., alkene-C and aromatic-C) in macroaggregates were higher at GP11 and GP36 than at GP26. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares pathmodeling (PLS-PM), and the relative importance of regressors all showed that glomalin-related soil proteins (GRSP) and nutrients indirectly improved aggregate stability in semiarid grassland through their influence on the GRSP accumulation potential and nutrient stoichiometry. Generally, after 26 years grazing prohibition had a positive effect on soil aggregate stability and nutrient accumulation in the semiarid grassland sites investigated for this study. Results from this study provide a theoretical basis to select appropriate grazing prohibition time frames under grassland management initiatives to optimize ecological quality measures in semiarid regions.

Materials and methods To determine the responses of litter decomposition and C and nutrient release to UV radiation, a meta-analysis that comprised 544 observations in field experiments was performed. Results and discussion The change in UV radiation had significant effects on litter mass loss and litter nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) release in field studies, and litter types affected only the magnitude of UV radiation changes on mass loss and nutrient release. In addition, mass loss and nutrient release varied as the decomposition process continued: UV enhancement accelerated litter decomposition only after 4 months of decomposition, whereas the effect of UV attenuation on litter decomposition decreased with decomposition time. The inhabitation of UV attenuation on litter decomposition increased with a decrease in precipitation. Conclusion Overall, the different responses of mass loss and nutrient release in litter decomposition to changes in ultraviolet radiation may cause different C and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems in the Southern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere.

In the current cropping systems worldwide, GPC is mostly determined by nitrogen (N) fertilizer application. The objectives of this study were to understand the differences in N response between high and low GPC wheat genotypes, and to assess the value of biomass growth analysis to assess the differences in N response. Six wheat genotypes from a range of high to low GPC were grown in low, medium and high N, under glasshouse conditions. This experiment was designed around non-destructive estimation of biomass using a high throughput image-based phenotyping system. Results showed that Spitfire and Mace had higher grain N% than Gazelle and QAL2000, and appeared to demand more N to grow their biomass. Moreover, at low N, Spitfire grew faster and achieved the maximum absolute growth rate earlier than high N-treated plants. High grain N% genotypes seem able to manage grain N reserves by compromising biomass production at low N. This study also indicated the importance of biomass growth analysis to show the differences in the N responsiveness of high and low GPC wheat.

Moench)-fallow (W-S-F) rotation. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with a split-split-plot arrangement. The main plot treatments were crop rotation phases W-S-F, S-F-W, and F-W-S. The sub-plots were tillage practices, i.e., conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-tillage (NT). And the sub-sub-plot treatments were N rates of 0, 45, 90, and 134 kg ha-1. Wheat yield increased at rates of 15.6, 9.3, 22.8, and 25.7 kg ha-1 for a kg N ha-1 increase in very low-, low-, high-, and very high-yielding environments (average yields of similar to 2000, 2500, 2800, and 4400 kg ha-1), respectively. On average, winter wheat yields were 7%-9% greater for CT compared with both NT and RT. Winter wheat removed about 52 kg N ha-1 from the unfertilized control treatment, but N uptake varied by N rate and growing conditions. Nitrogen use efficiency, N agronomic efficiency, and applied N recovery decreased as the N rate increased. Across environments, wheat yield increased by 16, 20, and 17 kg ha-1 for each additional kg ha-1 N applied under CT, NT, and RT, respectively, and additional 2-2.5 kg ha-1 yield increases for a mm increase in fallow precipitation. We concluded that wheat yield response to N is highly dependent on growing conditions, and NT required greater N fertilization than CT and RT for similar yields.

Genotype x Environment Interaction for Resistance to Early Leaf Spot of Groundnut Mini Core Collections in the Savannas of Nigeria	LEGUME RESEARCH												Background: The genetic yield potential of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) has been continuously challenged by several diseases including early leaf spot (ELS). Methods: In the current study, we evaluated groundnut mini core collections under artificial and natural disease epiphytotics in six environments to identify stable elite sources for ELS resistance and pod yield. Mixed model analysis was done to adequately capture the variance component as a result of genotype (G), environment (E) and G. E interaction (GEI). Result: Highly significant (p<0.001) effects for G and GEI on ELS and pod weight were observed. The parametric and non-parametric stability models ranked the genotype differently for their stability to ELS. The GGE biplot identified ICG 1519 as a stable genotype for the ELS resistance. For pod weight, ICG 8896 and ICG 7897 were consistently stable from all the stability models including the GGE biplot. ICG 9449 and ICG 4540 were identified as stable genotypes for both ELS and pod weight. These elite sources of ELS resistance identified in the current study will be useful in the development and deployment of groundnut varieties with resistance to ELS and high pod yielding potentials.

Straw mulching (SM), subsoiling (S), and combined amendments (subsoiling + straw mulching, SS) are potential solutions for maintaining crop productivity and water resource sustainability. However, short- and long-term applications of these methods appear to result in different yield and water use efficiency outcomes. In this study, we, therefore, compared short- and long-term applications of SM, S, and SS, with a control. We analyzed field experimental data of wheat and maize cultivation with control (conventional tillage), SM, S, and SS treatments to assess the impact on yield and water use efficiency, resulting from short- and long-term applications of these practices. The results show that SS treatment led to higher soil water storage (SWS) compared with other treatments during the regreening, jointing, and booting stages of wheat, and the big bellmouth and filling stages of maize in the short- and long-term experiments. However, long-term SS treatment also led to higher SWS in the growth stage of wheat in 2015-2016 and in the growth stage of maize in 2015. Additionally, SS treatment was conducive to raising the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and leaf water use efficiency (LWUE) of wheat compared with other treatments in 2015 and 2016. Conversely, Pn and LWUE of maize under S and SS treatments were higher (P < 0.05) compared with other treatments in the two studied years. Short-term treatment led to higher wheat yield compared with long term in 2014-2015 (ample rainfall) and of maize in 2016 (low rainfall). The yield of wheat under long-term S treatment in 2015 was 9625.-kg hm(-2), which was the highest (P < 0.05) in 2 years, with a 17.7% increase compared with the control, followed by short-term S treatment. However, the water use efficiency (WUE) of wheat under long-term SS treatment in 2016 was the highest (P < 0.05) compared with other treatments. The yield of maize under SM and S treatments was higher than other treatments, whereas the WUE of maize under long-term SS treatment in 2016 was still the highest (P < 0.05). Our findings provide evidence that S and SS treatments improve both crop productivity and water resource sustainability, and long-term application resulted in higher productivity than short-term application.					; van der Ploeg, Martine/B-6121-2014	Tang, Darrell/0000-0002-4743-3976; van der Ploeg, Martine/0000-0002-3172-7339														2673-3218				AUG 25	2021	3								708075	10.3389/fagro.2021.708075	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fagro.2021.708075													WOS:001007087400001

(camelina). A high-resolution spatially explicit life cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis (HR + LCA + TEA) was employed to elucidate camelina' s sustainability case. The potential camelina land was determined via the wheat-fallow Integrated Rotational Cycle (IRC) at county level for the 48 lower states in the U.S. Results revealed these lands were aggregated on the top wheat producing states of Montana, Kansas, and North Dakota at 19.5 x 10(6) ha, 18.2 x 10(6) ha, and 19.2 x 10(6) ha, for 2009, 2012, and 2015, respectively. If the high producing wheat lands (counties with >60,000-80,000 ha) in those states were grown with camelina at U.S. average yield of 1.2 Mg/ha, around 6.35 million m(3) (1.68 billion gal) of advanced biofuel will be produced, equivalent to 11.18 % of the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) volume mandate for advanced biofuel (15 billion gal). LCA results using 1 MJ functional unit and "well-to-air" (WTA) system boundary showed that the operations cumulative energy demand (CED) for the OMT case producing simultaneous biojet, avgas, and diesel was 0.75 MJ/MJ, lower than for hydroprocessed renewable jet (HRJ) fuel (0.77 MJ/MJ) but 6.8 times higher than for petroleum jet (PTJ) fuel (0.11 MJ/MJ). The entire OMT energy demand was offset by the bioelectricity produced (0.57 MJ/MJ) from burning the meal. OMT' s net GHG reduction relative to PTJ was 23.34 % but increasing camelina yield from 1.2 to 1.8 Mg/ha increased reduction to 75.71 %. TEA results adapting 100,000 m(3)/yr biofuel throughput showed that OMT and HRJ had profits of $21.94 M and $24.13 M, respectively, using mass product allocation. The limiting metric for OMT and HRJ was net present value (NPV), and the minimum camelina yield to ensure profit was 1.18 Mg/ha. OMT can achieve maximum profit by selling biojet fuel at a price not lower than $2.75/gal and selling camelina meal feed pellets at a minimum price of $330/Mg. No tax incentive was needed for biojet and avgas because even at their base median values (biojet = $2.19/gal, avgas = $2.59/gal), NPV is still positive.

Obtaining a high-precision spatial distribution map of soil nutrients is of great significance for the differentiated management of nutrient resources and reducing non-point source pollution. However, the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients lead to uncertainty in the modeling process. To determine the best interpolation method, terrain, climate, and vegetation factors were used as auxiliary variables to participate in the investigation of soil nutrient spatial modeling in the present study. We used the mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and accuracy (Acc) of a dataset to comprehensively compare the performance of four different geospatial techniques: ordinary kriging (OK), regression kriging (RK), geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK), and multiscale geographically weighted regression kriging (MGWRK). The results showed that the hybrid methods (RK, GWRK, and MGWRK) could improve the prediction accuracy to a certain extent when the residuals were spatially correlated; however, this improvement was not significant. The new MGWRK model has certain advantages in reducing the overall residual level, but it failed to achieve the desired accuracy. Considering the cost of modeling, the OK method still provides an interpolation method with a relatively simple analysis process and relatively reliable results. Therefore, it may be more beneficial to design soil sampling rationally and obtain higher-quality auxiliary variable data than to seek complex statistical methods to improve spatial prediction accuracy. This research provides a reference for the spatial mapping of soil nutrients at the farmland scale.

Although the effect of tillage practices on soil C dynamics is mediated by soil microbes, the relation between microbial community traits and SOC accumulation rate (SAR) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of tillage management on soil properties and microbial community traits (i.e. diversity, composition and keystone taxa) in a long-term (17 years) field experiment. Our experiment was located in a spring maize field with a sandy loam soil (Calcaric-Fluvic Cambisol) in northwest China and included three tillage practices: 1) CT-RR, conventional tillage with residue removed; 2) RT-RI, reduced tillage with residue incorporated; and 3) NT-RM, no-tillage with residue mulched. We sampled soil at 0-10 cm and 10-25 cm to assess the relation between bacterial and fungal community traits and SAR. We found that the initial and current of average SOC stocks was 19 and 28 Mg ha-1 at 0-25 cm, respectively. RT-RI and NTRM increased SOC accumulation at 0-10 cm by 116% and 131% compared with CT-RR, respectively, and RT-RI increased SOC accumulation at 10-25 cm by 159%. Changes in co-occurrence network analysis revealed that NTRM resulted in a stable bacterial network, whereas both RT-RI and NT-RM produced a stable fungal network relative to CT-RR. Microbial diversity and keystone taxa correlated positively with SAR under conservation tillage practices. Using a Zi-Pi plot, we identified several keystone OTUs, five of which (i.e. Cytophagales, JG30KF-CM45, Sphingobacteriales, Thelephorales and Pleosporales) showed a positive correlation with SAR. Our results suggest a strong link between microbial community traits and SOC accumulation rate under conservation tillage practices, and provide insights into the contribution of microbial traits to the sustainability of agroecosystems.					wang, bisheng/HDO-2404-2022; Li, Shengping/ABA-7547-2021; Liu, Xiaotong/AAT-4220-2021; van Groenigen, Kees Jan/Q-7081-2018	Li, Shengping/0000-0001-6940-9179; Liu, Xiaotong/0000-0001-9393-933X; van Groenigen, Kees Jan/0000-0002-9165-3925; Wu, Xueping/0000-0002-7772-0773													0167-1987	1879-3444				JUN	2022	220								105360	10.1016/j.still.2022.105360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2022.105360		MAR 2022											WOS:000793422900005

However, the combined effects of the fertilizer amount, precipitation during the growing season (PGS), and soil water storage before sowing (SWSS) on the photosynthetic characteristics and yield under this system are still unclear in winter wheat. Thus, in this study, we used path analysis to determine the effects of these three factors based on a field experiment conducted for five years in a semiarid region of Northwest China. Path analysis showed that precipitation during the sowing to filling stage (PSF) in winter wheat had the greatest influence on the photosynthesis gas exchange characteristics of flag leaves in the filling stage, followed by the fertilizer amount. And the determination coefficients of PSF on the photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate, stomatal conductance (Gs), leaf instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE) and relative chlorophyll content (SPAD value) were 0.331, 0.868, 0.864, 0.820, and 0.414, respectively. The most important factor for the grain yield was SWSS, where the coefficient of determination was 0.838, followed by the fertilizer amount and PGS, and the indirect effect of the fertilizer amount on SWSS was negative. Therefore, our results suggest that SWSS has an important effect on the grain yield in winter wheat under the RF system in semiarid regions, and thus improving the SWSS can obtain better increases in the grain yield compared with fertilizer amount.

However, quantifying sediment connectivity remains a challenging task due to its complexity and the difficulties associated with direct measurements of sediment flux at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Our research aims to address this challenge by monitoring functional sediment connectivity at various scales using two key indicators: sediment yield and sediment marks. Sediment yield is monitored at slope plots, slope-channel cascades, and watershed outlets, while sediment marks provide additional insight into functional sediment connectivity along the sediment transport path, particularly in slope-channel cascades and channels following rainfall events. To record sediment marks, we used wooden sticks wrapped with clean gauze as an alternative to assessing functional connectivity. Our results revealed that the activation of sediment connectivity was influenced by rainfall amount, intensity, and type, with the highest activation observed at the slope plot, followed by the outlet of the slopechannel cascade and the watershed outlet. Notably, strong sediment connectivity at slope plots, slope-channel cascades, and main channels exhibits a weak correlation with sediment connectivity at the watershed outlet. In upper contribution areas with lower vegetation coverage and higher human disturbance, rainfall amount and I60 values associated with sediment connectivity activation tend to be lower. Furthermore, our research indicates that medium-duration and moderate-intensity rainfall events have a more significant impact on sediment connectivity at slope plots, while rainfall types characterized by longer durations, lower intensity, and larger amounts have a more pronounced effect on sediment transport paths. This suggests that the identification of sediment connectivity switch nodes can be achieved by considering both rainfall characteristics and underlying surface features. Looking ahead, future research can leverage long-term observations and data-driven models to explore rainfall thresholds for sediment connectivity at various scales, ultimately improving sediment transport prediction within watersheds.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2024	235								107654	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107654	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107654		NOV 2023											WOS:001110404900001

However, most of the existing apple detection algorithms cannot distinguish between the apples that are occluded by tree branches and occluded by other apples. The apples, grasping end-effector and mechanical picking arm of the robot are very likely to be damaged if the algorithm is directly applied to the picking robot. Based on this practical problem, in order to automatically recognize the graspable and ungraspable apples in an apple tree image, a light-weight apple targets detection method was proposed for picking robot using improved YOLOv5s. Firstly, BottleneckCSP module was improved designed to BottleneckCSP-2 module which was used to replace the BottleneckCSP module in backbone architecture of original YOLOv5s network. Secondly, SE module, which belonged to the visual attention mechanism network, was inserted to the proposed improved backbone network. Thirdly, the bonding fusion mode of feature maps, which were inputs to the target detection layer of medium size in the original YOLOv5s network, were improved. Finally, the initial anchor box size of the original network was improved. The experimental results indicated that the graspable apples, which were unoccluded or only occluded by tree leaves, and the ungraspable apples, which were occluded by tree branches or occluded by other fruits, could be identified effectively using the proposed improved network model in this study. Specifically, the recognition recall, precision, mAP and F1 were 91.48%, 83.83%, 86.75% and 87.49%, respectively. The average recognition time was 0.015 s per image. Contrasted with original YOLOv5s, YOLOv3, YOLOv4 and EfficientDet-D0 model, the mAP of the proposed improved YOLOv5s model increased by 5.05%, 14.95%, 4.74% and 6.75% respectively, the size of the model compressed by 9.29%, 94.6%, 94.8% and 15.3% respectively. The average recognition speeds per image of the proposed improved YOLOv5s model were 2.53, 1.13 and 3.53 times of EfficientDet-D0, YOLOv4 and YOLOv3 and model, respectively. The proposed method can provide technical support for the real-time accurate detection of multiple fruit targets for the apple picking robot.

However, it remains unclear how inoculated microbes affect rhizosphere microbial communities or whether subsequent changes in rhizosphere microbiomes contribute to improving plant resistance under metal stress. This study investigated the effects of rhizobia and AMF inoculation on alfalfa resistance to Cd stress. The response of rhizosphere microbial communities to inoculation and its role in increasing alfalfa' ability to cope with stress were further analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of 16S and ITS rRNA genes. Results showed that single rhizobia or AMF inoculation significantly improved alfalfa resistance to Cd stress, while their co-inoculation resulted in the greatest overall improvement. Improved resistance was reflected by the significant mitigation of Cd-induced lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress caused by increases in antioxidant enzyme activities along with co-inoculation. Furthermore, co-inoculation significantly altered the rhizosphere microbial community structure by decreasing fungal community diversity and increasing bacterial community diversity. Results of partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) and variation partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that the rhizosphere bacterial community predominated over the fungal community with respected to improvements in resistance to Cd stress under the co-inoculation treatments. This improvement was specifically seen in the enrichment of certain key bacterial taxa (including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi) induced by the rhizobia and AMF co-inoculation, enhancing alfalfa' ability to uptake rhizosphere nutrients and reduce its release of photosynthetically-derived carbon (C) into soil. Our findings revealed that the co-inoculation of multiple symbiotic microbes can assist plants to effectively cope with Cd stress, providing a greater understanding of rhizosphere bacterial taxa in the microbe-induced phytomanagement.

Effects of long-term rotation and tillage practice on grain yield and protein of wheat and soil fertility on a Vertosol in a medium-rainfall temperate environment	CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE												Fundamental changes in farming systems occurred throughout the medium-rainfall zone of southern Australia during the late 1990s. Pulse and canola crops replaced pastures and long-fallowing, and minimal-tillage practices were increasingly adopted. An experiment was established in 1998 to examine long-term effects of these changes on crop productivity and soil fertility. Nine rotation-tillage treatments based on 3-and 6-year cycles were compared by using wheat (Triticum aestivum) as a bioassay crop over 2001-17. Seasonal conditions during the study ranged from the Millennium Drought to the top rainfall decile. Averaged across the 17 seasons, wheat yields were significantly lower in rotations based on continuous wheat (1.73 t/ha) or 3 years of perennial lucerne (Medicago sativa) (1.93 t/ha) and highest after traditional long-fallow (2.92 t/ha) or vetch (Vicia sativa) green manure (2.57 t/ha). Wheat yields following a pulse (2.23 t/ha) or canola (Brassica napus) (2.21 t/ha) were intermediate. Whereas rotation effects varied with seasonal rainfall, there was a long-term trend for relative yields in continuous wheat rotations to decline and those following a green manure or fallow to differ increasingly from other treatments. Compared across the same rotation (canola-wheat-pulse), average wheat yields under no-tillage (2.09 t/ha) were significant lower (P < 0.05) than under reduced (2.22 t/ha) and conventional (2.29 t/ha) tillage. By contrast, grain protein concentration increased with increasing proportion and type of legumes (green manure and pasture >pulse) in the rotation via their effect on soil mineral nitrogen (N). Lowest protein was recorded in continuous wheat and highest where at least one-third of the rotation contained a non-pulse legume, i.e. vetch green manure, lucerne or annual medic (Medicago truncatula). Soil-borne cereal fungal pathogens and nematodes generally had little effect on grain yields. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N stocks declined in all treatments over time, except in the lucerne and green manure treatments, where total N was maintained. Greatest declines in SOC and total N occurred in the fallow treatment. Results from the first 20 years of experimentation suggest that differences in grain yield (and protein) of wheat were most likely the result of treatment (rotation and tillage practice) effects on soil nitrate and water (growing-season rainfall and fallow storage) rather than disease. We found no evidence that current farming systems based on use of pulses, canola and reduced tillage are less able to maintain intervening cereal yields than traditional systems. On the contrary, practices such as long-fallowing are expected to have increasing negative influence on productivity in the longer term via decreased soil C and N fertility.																			1836-0947	1836-5795					2019	70	1					1	15		10.1071/CP17437	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP17437													WOS:000457014300001

The present study aimed to analyze the changes in plant-soil-enzyme stoichiometry and microbial nutrient limitation to PSF, and identify the roles of nutrient limitation in PSF. Setaria viridis, Stipa bungeana, and Bothriochloa ischaemum were selected as representative grass species in early-, mid-, and late-succession; furthermore, three soil types were collected from grass species communities in early-, mid-, and late-succession to treat the three successional species. A 3-year (represents three growth periods) PSF experiment was performed with the three grasses in the soil in the three succession stages. We analyzed plant biomass and plant-soil-enzyme C-N-P stoichiometry for each plant growth period. The plant growth period mainly affected the plant C:N in the early- and late- species but showed a less pronounced effect on the soil C:N. During the three growth periods, the plants changed from N-limited to P-limited; the three successional species soils were mainly limited by N, whereas the microbes were limited by both C and N. The plant-soil-enzyme stoichiometry and plant biomass were not significantly correlated. In conclusion, during PSF, the plant growth period significantly influences the plant-soil-microbial nutrient limitations. Plant-soil-enzyme stoichiometry and microbial nutrient limitation cannot effectively explain PSF during succession on the Loess Plateau.																			1664-462X					SEP 20	2022	13								1009886	10.3389/fpls.2022.1009886	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1009886								36204057					WOS:000867249400001

Solutions of fKWE presented have been derived for large time or when the Laplace transform variable s -> 0, which is one of the most important situations for overland flow. The solutions include expressions for the depth, velocity, and unit discharge, of overland flow. Fitting the approximate solution for the depth of overland flow to the data yields the values of the order of space-fractional derivatives, rho, which is around rho = 1.5. It is found that rho increases with the slope gradient and the rainfall intensity. The approximate order of rho = 1.5, which is about the average of order 1 for the advection equation and 2 for the diffusion equation, implies that diffusive mechanisms manifest in the overland flow. The findings mean that either an fKWE is used or a diffusion term is needed to account for dynamic forces in overland flow as the fKWE captures more physical mechanisms.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				JAN	2022	604								127202	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127202		DEC 2021											WOS:000751951900005

This index is also employed in evaluating the amount of pesticide sprayed per unit volume of apple trees. Hence, numerous manual and automatic methods have been explored for LAI estimation. In this work, the leaf area indices for different types of apple trees are obtained in terms of multispectral remote-sensing data collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), along with simultaneous measurements of apple orchards. The proposed approach was tested on apple trees of the "Fuji", "Golden Delicious", and "Ruixue" types, which were planted in the Apple Experimental Station of the Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University in Baishui County, Shaanxi Province, China. Five vegetation indices of strong correlation with the apple leaf area index were selected and used to train models of support vector regression (SVR) and gradient-boosting decision trees (GBDT) for predicting the leaf area index of apple trees. The best model was selected based on the metrics of the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The experimental results showed that the gradient-boosting decision tree model achieved the best performance with an R-2 of 0.846, an RMSE of 0.356, and a spatial efficiency (SPAEF) of 0.57. This demonstrates the feasibility of our approach for fast and accurate remote-sensing-based estimation of the leaf area index of apple trees.

Understanding the changes in soil physical and hydraulic properties in topsoils and deep soils after converting forest to cropland would reveal the mechanism related to the black soil degradation. Herein, we investigated the variations in the soil water-stable aggregates, soil water content, bulk density, field capacity, total porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and parameters of soil water retention curve at the 0-100 cm depth in four sampling fields. These fields included a forest as control and three croplands that were converted from forest 41, 50 and 65 years ago in the black soil region of Northeast China. We showed that converting forest to cropland decreased> 2 mm aggregates and aggregate stability especially at 0-15 and 70-100 cm depths, with a greater decrease in cropland after relatively longer time of cultivation. Conversion of forest to cropland significantly decreased the soil water content at the 0-15 cm depth but increased it at the 15-100 cm depth, and the increase in the 50-100 cm soil layer was strengthened with cultivation time. The decreases in field capacity, total porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity and increase in bulk density at the 0-50 cm depth following the conversion of forest to cropland were higher after 41 and 50 years of cultivation than those after 65 years of cultivation. However, changes in these metrics at the 50-100 cm depth increased with cultivation time. The parameters (i.e., theta(r), theta(s), alpha and n) of the soil water retention curve were not affected by the cultivation time after converting forest to cropland. These results highlighted that long-term cultivation after the conversion of forest to cropland resulted in the changes in soil physical and hydraulic properties in the 0-100 cm soil profiles, and thus, the response of deep soils should not be ignored in this black soil region.

Planted woodland and natural grass vegetation are the main vegetation restoration strategies for preventing soil erosion on the Loess Plateau of China. However, the response of soil microbial community and diversity to planted woodland and natural grass vegetation is largely unknown in this region. Here, we investigated soil microbial community and diversity using high-throughput sequencing approaches in planted woodland and natural grass vegetation. We found a disproportionate influence of planted woodland and natural grass vegetation on soil microbial diversity, and there was an increase of soil fungal diversity and a decrease of soil bacterial diversity in planted woodland. Both soil pH and soil organic carbon (SOC) were highly related to soil microbial diversity in planted woodland and natural grass vegetation. Moreover, we found the complex interaction networks of soil fungal community in planted woodland. Meanwhile, there were the higher total path coefficients of soil fungal diversity and the lower total path coefficients of bacterial diversity in planted woodland according to SEM (structural equation modeling). Besides, planted woodland explained more variation to soil fungal diversity and natural grass vegetation explained more variation to soil bacterial diversity, indicating that soil fungal diversity was more easily affected by planted woodland, while soil bacterial diversity was more easily affected by natural grass vegetation. To enhance the balance of soil microbial diversity, we suggested that both planted woodland and natural grass vegetation are needed in this region, highlighting the necessity of understanding soil microbial ecology to manage vegetation restoration on the Loess Plateau of China.

However, the drivers of soil microbial metabolic limitation (SMML) changes remain poorly understood following vegetation restoration. We compared sites along a vegetation restoration chronosequence over a 30-year period on the Loess Plateau, China, and measured the potential activities of two C-acquiring enzymes (beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG) and beta-D-cellobiosidase (CBH)), two N-acquiring enzymes (beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) and L-leucine aminopeptidase (LAP)), and one organic-P-acquiring enzyme (alkaline phosphatase (AP)), to quantify and compare the variations in metabolic limitations for soil microorganisms using EEA stoichiometry. The results showed constant microbial P limitation, but not N limitation, and an open downward "unimodal" trend in microbial C limitation; however, the microbial P limitation displayed exactly the opposite trend during vegetation restoration. Restoration age and properties of plant, soil, and microorganisms contributed to 82.9% of microbial C limitation and 84.6% of microbial P limitation, with soil presenting the highest relative effects of 76.1% and 59.6% on microbial C and P limitations, respectively. Plant productivity and species diversity decreased microbial C limitation owing to increasing plant C inputs, but increased microbial P limitation owing to plant nutrients competition with soil microorganisms. When the fungi:bacteria ratio in the soil increased, the SMML increased. Vegetation restoration increased the soil nutrients content and reduced SMML, and a decrease in the soil water content increased microbial P limitation. Thus, the effects of long-term vegetation restoration on SMML were the result of combined influences of plants, soil, and microorganisms.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Huang, Chunbo/0000-0001-6222-215X													0016-7061	1872-6259				NOV 1	2019	353						188	200		10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.06.037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.06.037													WOS:000482513900018

Failing to recognize these responses overstates the risks confronting producers and understates their ability to respond to adverse circumstances. Dynamic programming (DP) provides a means for determining optimal long-term crop management plans. However, most applications in the literature base their analysis on annual time steps with fixed strategies within the year, effectively ignoring conditional responses during the year. We suggest an alternative approach that captures the strategic responses within a cropping season to random weather variables as they unfold, reflecting farmers' ability to adapt to weather realizations. We illustrate our approach by applying it to a typical cereal farm in Karak, Jordan. The results show that including conditional within-year responses to weather reduces the frequency of fallowing by 23% and increases expected income by 9%.

Thus, studying the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamic caused by splash erosion is essential. Methods Simulated rainfall splash experiments were conducted on three cultivated soils with different SOC contents (black soil, purple soil, and red soil) to investigate the dynamics of SOC related to splash erosion, and the splash distance was 0-5, 5-10, 10-17, 17-28, 28-40 cm, respectively. Results SOC was unevenly distributed and enriched in different-sized aggregates. The enrichment ratio of SOC (EROC) was basically greater than 1 and increased as the splash distance increased. Moreover, the variation of EROC differed from that in the aggregate enrichment ratio (ERA), and the EROC in large macroaggregates (> 0.5 mm) decreased with increasing ERA. The weight proportion of SOC mobilization with different-sized aggregates was consistent with the mass percentage of aggregates. Specifically, there was a significant positive exponential relationship between SOC mobilization and the aggregate mass of the greatest proportion, indicating that the mobilization of SOC was mainly affected by the aggregate mass of the greatest proportion. Conclusions Our findings indicated that SOC migration can be realized by aggregates transport under splash erosion, indicating that improving soil structure will help to reduce SOC migration and even loss.

Understanding the water-use strategies and physiological characteristics of these two species are important for evaluating their adaptability in water-limited ecosystems. We used stable isotopes (D and O-18), physiological parameters (e.g. midday and predawn leaf water potential and stomatal conductance (psi(md), psi(pd) and g(s), respectively)) and foliar delta C-13 to analyse water sources, isohydric/anisohydric behaviour, and water-use efficiency (WUE), respectively, of these two shrub species. Our results show that S. psammophila relied on water (mean 60%) from the intermediate soil layer (30-80 cm from the surface) during the dry period (May and June), while C. korshinskii relied on water from the deep soil layer (80-100 cm) (mean 52%). Both species shifted to using water from the shallow layer (0-30 cm) during the wet period (July and August) (mean 61% for S. psammophila and 51% for C. korshinskii). These root water uptake patterns are consistent with C. korshinskii's physiological performance, which in turn is consistent with a description that C. korshinskii is an anisohydric species as evidenced by a steeper slope of the relationship between psi(md) and psi(pd) (sigma, 1.88), and a larger difference between psi(md) and psi(pd) (Delta psi, -1.66 +/- 0.10 MPa). In contrast, S. psammophila could be described as an isohydric species (0.82 for s and -0.77 +/- 0.02 MPa for Delta psi). Surprisingly, despite being anisohydric, C. korshinski showed greater long-term WUE than isohydric S. psammophila, particularly during the dry season. Insofar as water availability is concerned, these results show that the environmental adaptability of C. korshinskii may generally be more ecologically plastic than that of S. psammophila. Our study serves as a reference for evaluating the persistence of shrub species in relation to the management and restoration of ecosystems.

However, there is little consensus about the responses of maize to combined N and S application. Field and pot experiments were conducted to assess the effects of different N and S levels on grain yield, biomass, and N and S uptake. In addition, we determined the sufficiency range of N and S concentrations in different maize parts to decide whether N or S application is necessary. Field experiments consisted of different N and S treatments, and were conducted during 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016. Pot experiments included 25 treatments, i.e., the factorial combinations of five N levels (0, 7.5, 15, 22.5, and 30 mM) and five S levels (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mM). Data in pot experiments were used to explain and validate the findings in field experiments. The results showed that N and S levels had significant interactions on grain yield (field experiments), biomass, N and S uptake, leaf area, leaf chlorophyll concentration, and root area (pot experiments). Leaf area, leaf chlorophyll concentration, and root area showed significant linear relationships with grain yield and biomass (field and pot experiments). There were synergies between N and S assimilation because glutamine synthetase contributed to S uptake, while ATP sulfurylase contributed to N uptake. Leaf N concentration and leaf N:S ratio together were suitable for determining whether N and S application is necessary. For >= 95% maximum relative yield (field experiments), the sufficiency range of leaf N was 25.9-29.3 mg N g(-1) while that of leaf N:S ratio was 16.3-19.6. Overall, maize yield, growth and physiological traits, and N and S uptake can be improved by adjusting application rates of N and S. Nitrogen concentration and the N:S ratio in leaves can be used to guide N and S management in maize production.						jing, jianyuan/0000-0001-8481-9600													0378-4290	1872-6852				OCT 1	2019	242								107593	10.1016/j.fcr.2019.107593	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2019.107593													WOS:000495489800007

However, intense water exchange between soil-plant and soil-atmosphere interfaces only occurs in a certain layer of the soil profile. For deep insight into water active layer (WAL, defined as the soil layer with a coefficient of variation in soil water content >10% in a given time domain) in the Loess Plateau of China, we measured soil water content (SWC) in the 0.0-5.0 m soil profile from 86 sampling sites along an approximately 860-km long south-north transect during the period 2013-2016. Moreover, a dataset contained four climatic factors (mean annual precipitation, mean annual evaporation, annual mean temperature and mean annual dryness index) and five local factors (altitude, slope gradient, land use, clay content and soil organic carbon) of each sampling site was obtained. In this study, three WAL indices (WALT (the thickness of WAL), WAL-CV (the mean coefficient of variation in SWC within WAL) and WALSWC (the mean SWC within WAL)) were used to evaluate the characteristics of WAL. The results showed that with increasing latitude, WAL-T and WAL-CV increased firstly and then decreased. WAL-SWC showed an opposite distribution pattern along the south-north transect compared with WAL-T and WAL-CV. Average WAL-T of the transect was 2.0 m, suggesting intense soil water exchange in the 0.0-2.0 m soil layer in the study area. Soil water exchange was deeper and more intense in the middle region than in the southern and northern regions, with the values of WAL-CV and WAL-T being 27.3% and 4.3 m in the middle region, respectively. Both climatic (10.1%) and local (4.9%) factors influenced the indices of WAL, with climatic factors having a more dominant effect. Compared with multiple linear regressions, pedotransfer functions (PTFs) from artificial neural network can better estimate the WAL indices. PTFs developed by artificial neural network respectively explained 86%, 81% and 64% of the total variations in WAL-T, WAL-SWC and WAL-CV. Knowledge of WAL is crucial for understanding the regional water budget and evaluating the stable soil water reserve, regional water characteristics and eco-hydrological processes in the Loess Plateau of China.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				APR	2019	11	2					228	240		10.1007/s40333-019-0051-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-019-0051-4													WOS:000465023800006

Puddling now-a-days, has become a major challenge for farmers due to breaking the soil structure, deficit water regimes, and depletion of soil health. Keeping in view, the absolute need to fulfill food security as well as sustainability, an experiment was conducted for 2 years on a rice-lentil cropping system during 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 in sandy clay loam soil of a new alluvial zone of eastern India to evaluate effects of minimum tillage and integrated nutrient management on yield and soil health. Conventional tillage (CT) direct seeded rice-lentil, Minimum tillage(MT) direct seeded rice-lentil, MT transplanted rice-lentil and MT direct seeded rice-lentil were kept as main plot treatments and control (without any fertilizer), 100% RDF, 75% nitrogen + FYM, 75% nitrogen + FYM + Azospirillum and 75% Nitrogen + FYM + Azospirillum sp. + Zinc Sulphate were kept as subplot treatments during the study. Though conventional tillage treatments recorded higher LAI, CGR and yield in the first year of study in the case of rice; during the second year, minimum tillage treatments showed significantly (p & LE; 0.05) better results in the aforesaid aspects with MTDSR-L having a maximum yield of 5.17 t ha(-1). In the case of lentil minimum tillage treatments had better results for both years, with MTDSR-L treatment having the highest yield of 8.084 t ha(-1). Among the nutrient schedules, the crops had better LAI, CGR and yield during the first year in the case of 100% RDF treatment, but in the second year, 75% Nitrogen + FYM + Azospirillum sp. + Zinc Sulphate had the highest respective values. Soil organic carbon was marginally improved by both tillage and nutrient treatments, while soil microbial biomass carbon, dehydrogenase activity and microbial count were significantly influenced. The combination of MTDSR-L and 75% Nitrogen + FYM + Azospirillum sp. + Zinc Sulphate (N-5) treatment showed the maximum values for all soil biological parameters leading to improve soil health. The results of the experiment concluded that the practice of minimum tillage and integrated nutrient management may be recommended to enhance the yield and stability of rice-lentil cropping systems in sandy clay loam soil of a new alluvial zone of eastern India by acting as an alternative for the decline of soil health.

In this paper, a simple solvent-cast method was used to fabricate gutta percha films with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by homogeneously dispersing different amount of CNTs (0%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2%, wt/%) through gutta percha matrix. The obtained nanocomposite films were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Meanwhile, the wettability, mechanical properties, water vapor barrier properties, electromagnetic absorption of films as well as their photo-thermal conversion of the soil were investigated in detail. The results showed that the 1% loading of CNTs film significantly improved the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite films compared to the control: the tensile strength, elongation at break and Young's modulus were increased by 44.0%, 30.5% and 26.1%, respectively. In addition, the CNTs/gutta percha films demonstrated lower thermal stability, glass transition temperature (T-g), melting enthalpy (Delta Hm) crystallinity and water vapor permeability (WVP) than the pristine gutta percha film. Especially, the WVP value of the film with 1% CNTs was the lowest. And finally, the soil warming experiments showed that the 1% CNTs film had the highest 83.73% photo-thermal conversion efficiency, compared to the 18.61% for control. This nanocomposite film has the potential for application in agriculture in arid regions because of its high stretchability and photo-thermal conversion efficiency, which could be potential application in agricultural mulch.

To assess the photosynthetic contributions of these organs, the correlations between these photosynthetic areas and single-spike weight were investigated in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under four nitrogen and mulching treatments: N120, N150, N195, and N195 + M. Two-year repeated field experiments were conducted on the Loess Plateau of China. Non-foliar photosynthetic area, grain-filling ratio and duration, grain yield, and in particular, single-spike weight, were measured, recorded and analyzed. Under the N195 + M treatment, plants showed the largest area of photosynthetic organs (flag leaf and non-foliar organs) and the highest grain yield and single spike weight. Single-spike weight was positively correlated with the areas of all examined non-foliar photosynthetic organs, in particular with the area above the flag leaf node (R-2 = 0.761*) and the area above the exposed part of the peduncle (EXP) (R-2 = 0.800**). In addition, single-spike weight was highly correlated with average grain-filling ratio (R-2 = 0.993**), whereas it was less highly correlated with grain-filling duration (R-2 = 0.533). The morphological traits of non-foliar photosynthetic organs were also more highly correlated with average grain-filling ratio than with average grain-filling duration. The significant correlation between each of the morphological traits (area, length and width) of EXP and single-spike weight indicates that morphological traits of EXP are important in determining spike weight in the Loess Plateau environment.

G.			Heterosis and combining abilities in a diverse seven-parent pearl millet population diallel tested in West Africa	EUPHYTICA												Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] is an important food-security crop to smallholder farmers in West Africa (WA). Breeding for high yield and stability is a major challenge in the harsh environments of WA but could be tackled by a more systematic exploitation of hybrid vigor and heterosis in breeding of both open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) and different types of hybrids. Knowledge of combining ability patterns and quantitative-genetic parameters is required for an efficient development of hybrid vigor and heterosis in breeding programs. Hence, our objectives were to complement other existing studies and estimate the combining ability of seven unique, highly diverse Sahelian pearl millet populations from Senegal, Mali, Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger, Sudan and Nigeria and the heterosis and stability of their 42 diallel-derived population hybrids (or hybrid populations) to inform pearl millet OPV and hybrid breeding. The materials were evaluated in six environments in WA in 2007. Grain yield (GY) exhibited an average panmictic mid-parent heterosis of 24%, ranging from - 1.51 to 64.69%. General combining ability (GCA) was significant across test environments as reflected by high heritability estimates and high GCA:SCA variance ratios. Thus, early selection for parental per se performance would be rewarding. The parental population from Sudan (IP8679) had strongly negative GCA for GY. Its lack of adaptation contributed to the predominance of additive effects in the present germplasm set. Parental populations PE02987 (Senegal), PE05344 (Mali) and ICMV IS 92222 (Niger) showed large positive GCA for GY. Their offspring, especially PE02987 x PE05344 and Kapelga x ICMV IS 92222, exhibited a high and stable GY across all test environments. Tapping the regional pearl millet genetic diversity and preselecting the crossing parents seem beneficial for OPV and hybrid breeding to increase pearl millet productivity in WA.

For optimized and efficient resource use, a shift from business as usual towards green economy is imperative. Therefore, a study to address these challenges, through integrating diverse crops and allied enterprises under an integrated farming system (IFS) model was carried out. We hypothesized that a standardized IFS model with appropriate location-specific modules will have higher system output, income, and lesser environmental footprints. Vegetable cultivation (VC), protected vegetable cultivation (PVC), field crops (FC), mushroom production (MP), and beekeeping (BK) were evaluated under the IFS model, with objectives to optimize the coherent use of available farm resources with enhancing system productivity and profitability. Among the FC module, the system productivity increased from 21-247% of different cropping systems, over the predominant rice-wheat system (RWS). The integration of different components, viz., VP + PVC + FC + AHS + MP + BK + VC in M-10 resulted in achieving the maximum water productivity (6.72 kg/m(3)), energy productivity (1.50 kg/MJ), net return (9446 USD/ha), employment opportunities (792 man-days), sustainable livelihood index (70.2%), and nutrient cycling (138.12, 67.9, and 381.6 kg/ha of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, respectively). These findings can be a scientific basis for the optimization and sustainable management of natural resources under different modules of IFS for the less-endowed small and marginal farmers.

J	Oniki, S; Berhe, M; Negash, T				Oniki, Shunji; Berhe, Melaku; Negash, Teklay			Role of Social Norms in Natural Resource Management: The Case of the Communal Land Distribution Program in Northern Ethiopia	LAND												The increasing population pressure in the rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa has caused land degradation as well as an increase in the number of landless farmers. To promote a conservation-oriented utilization of communal lands and increase the livelihood of poor farmers, the Ethiopian government introduced a program to distribute less-utilized communal lands to landless farmers. This study identified the social norms related to natural resource conservation that affect the participation in this program. Using data from 477 farmer households in northern Ethiopia, we estimated probit models with endogenous regressors for the determinants of social norms and their impacts on program participation. The results show that social norms related to conservation positively affect program participation. Regarding policy implication of the findings, an intervention to improve the social norms of local farmers leads to sustainable resource conservation without reducing intrinsic motivation of the local people. A conservation-oriented utilization of the communal lands would be more effective if the land distribution program was accompanied by other programs to improve the social norms in the villages.

The results showed that oxygenated functional groups (e. g. hydroxyl, carbonyl, etc.) in industrial lignin-based biochar, the synergistic effect of transition metals Fe and Mn, and defective structures were the active sites for activation of peroxy-disulfate. SO4 center dot- produced during the degradation process assumed a key function. Significantly, 38 intermediates were innovatively proposed for the first time in the system, and oxytetracycline was degraded in 7 ways, including deamidation, demethylation, hydroxylation, secondary alcohol oxidation, ring opening, dehydration, and carbonylation. A new perspective on the application of industrial lignin in the advanced oxidative degradation of organic pollutants was provided by this study.

The mechanical hand has four suction cups evenly distributed in the hand, which produce concave deformation under negative vacuum pressure to fit the apple surface and adsorb the apple; the fruit stalk is separated by wrist rotation and dragging in a compound way to complete the picking operation. This paper firstly determines the key parameters of the mechanical hand based on the characteristics of silicone material and the three growth postures of apples, tries to make a physical prototype of the mechanical hand and conducts relevant performance tests on the picking platform built in the laboratory to explore the best combination of parameters and further optimize the manipulator. The results show that the success rate of the biomimetic nondestructive apple picker with the best combination of parameters is 100%, 76% and 68% for three different apple-growth postures and the operation is smooth, reliable, safe and non-invasive.

Determination of watershed soil erosion rates and sediment yields is essential for reasonable utilization of water resources and soil loss control. In this study, we employed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry to determine the sediment yields in 24 dam-controlled watersheds in the Pisha sandstone region of the northern Loess Plateau. High differences in total sediment were trapped before the check dams due to their running periods and sediment yields. The estimated specific sediment yield ranged from 34.32 t/(ha & BULL;a) to 123.80 t/(ha & BULL;a) with an average of 63.55 t/(ha & BULL;a), which indicated that the Pisha sandstone region had an intense soil erosion rate. Furthermore, the modified Sediment Distributed Delivery (SEDD) model was applied to identify the erosion-prone areas in the watersheds, and the sediment retained in the check dams were used for model calibration. The performance of the model was acceptable, and the modeling results indicated that the steep Pisha sandstone was the major sediment source for the watersheds, accounting for approximately 87.37% of the sediment yield. Catchment area, erosive precipitation, and badland proportion were the key factors for sediment yield in the dam-controlled watersheds of the Pisha sandstone region, according to multiple regression analyses. These findings indicated that the modified SEDD model is very efficient in identifying spatial heterogeneities of sediment yield in the watershed but requires comprehensive calibration and validation with long-term observations. The Pisha sandstone region is still the key area of soil erosion control in the Loess Plateau, which needs more attention for soil and water conservation due to high sediment yield.

J	Quintus, S; Lincoln, NK				Quintus, Seth; Lincoln, Noa Kekuewa			Integrating Local and Regional in Pre-Contact Hawaiian Agriculture at Kahuku, Hawai'i Island	ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY												The agricultural systems of the Hawaiian archipelago were some of the most intensive in the Pacific and this scale of intensity is well illustrated by the large agricultural landscapes of leeward Hawai'i Island. Previous research in the area has centred on understanding the relationship between agriculture, political process, and large-scale environmental conditions. Much of this research has been oriented at the regional level, privileging discussion of elite management and oversight, with only limited investigation exploring farmer-centric adaptation at local scales. In this paper, we assess the integration of local and regional processes in Hawaiian agriculture using recent paired archaeological and ecological data from the Ka'u Field System as a case study. We demonstrate the presence of both general patterns previously identified in the archipelago and particular adaptations to the local environment of Kahuku ahupua'a. In particular, we highlight targeted infrastructural developments that allowed for cultivation of what would otherwise be a difficult cultivation medium within the confines of a larger, likely regionally organised, field system constrained by general soil biogeochemical thresholds. We argue that such investigations provide an increased understanding on how these large-scale agricultural landscapes were formed by integration at multiple social and spatial scales.																			1461-4103	1749-6314				JAN 2	2020	25	1					53	68		10.1080/14614103.2018.1497833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14614103.2018.1497833													WOS:000508897100004

The main objective of the study was to evaluate the interactive effect of N and P fertilizers on maize growth, grain yield, nitrogen uptake and N use efficiency. Field experiments were conducted during the 2015 and 2016 cropping seasons at Iburu in southern Guinea and Zaria in northern Guinea savanna zones of Nigeria. The treatments consisted of three levels of nitrogen (0, 60, and 120 kg N ha -1) and three levels of phosphorus (0, 13, and 26 kg P ha -1). The experimental design consisted of three replications in a split-plot design, with N as the main plot and P as the subplot. Our results show that the response of maize to N de-pends on the application of P. Higher yields were obtained with the combined application of 120 kg N ha -1 and 26 kg P ha -1 in both locations. With no P applied, plant N uptake (PNU) was greater at N rate of 120 kg ha -1 at Iburu while in Zaria, it increases with increase in N from 0 to 60 kg ha -1. When P was applied at 13 kg ha -1, the PNU increased by 52 and 66% at Iburu while in Zaria the increases were 51 and 57% each with N application of 60 and 120 kg ha -1, respectively, compared with zero N rate. The values for N recovery efficiency (NRE) and agronomic efficiency (AE) were lower for N rate of 120 than for 60 kg ha -1 irrespective of P application rate at both locations. The N utilization efficiency (NUTE) however was higher at 120 N kg ha -1 under 26 kg P ha-1across locations. It can be concluded from these results that in low fertile soils environments such as the Nigeria savannas, N fertilizer should be applied along with P fertilizer for optimum growth, grain yield and ni-trogen use efficiency of maize.

J	Qin, J; Shangguan, ZP				Qin, Juan; Shangguan, Zhouping			Effects of forest types on leaf functional traits and their interrelationships of <i>Pinus massoniana</i> coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests in the subtropical mountain, Southeastern China	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Leaf functional traits are widely used to detect and explain adaptations that enable plants to live under various environmental conditions. This study aims to determine the difference in leaf functional traits among four forest types of Pinus massoniana coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests by leaf morphological, nutrients, and stoichiometric traits in the subtropical mountain, Southeastern China. Our study indicated that the evergreen conifer species of P. massoniana had higher leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf C content, C/N and C/P ratios, while the three deciduous broad-leaved species of L. formosana, Q. tissima, and P. strobilacea had higher specific leaf area (SLA), leaf N, leaf P nutrient contents, and N/P ratio in the three mixed forest types. The results showed that the species of P. massoniana has adapted to the nutrient-poor environment by increasing their leaf dry matter for higher construction costs thereby reducing water loss and reflects a resource conservation strategy. In contrast, the three species of L. formosana, Q. tissima, and P. strobilacea exhibited an optimized resource acquisition strategy rather than resource conservation strategy in the subtropical mountain of southeastern China. Regarding the four forest types, the three mixed forest types displayed increased plant leaf nutrient contents when compared to the pure P. massoniana forest, especially the P. massoniana-L. formosana mixed forest type (PLM). Overall, variation in leaf functional traits among different forest types may play an adaptive role in the successful survival of plants under diverse environments because leaf functional traits can lead to significant effects on leaf function, especially for their acquisition of nutrients and use of light. The results of this study are beneficial to reveal the changes in plant leaf functional traits at the regional scale, which will provide a foundation for predicting changes in leaf traits and adaptation in the future environment.																			2045-7758					JUN	2019	9	12					6922	6932		10.1002/ece3.5259	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5259								31380024					WOS:000478648300013

However, knowledge to date on global phylogenetic endemism and its determinants has been lacking. Here, we conduct the first global analysis of phylogenetic endemism patterns of land vertebrates (>30,000 species), their environmental correlates, and threats. We found that low temperature seasonality and high topographic heterogeneity were the main global determinants of phylogenetic endemism. While phylogenetic endemism hotspots cover 22% of Earth, these regions currently have a high human footprint, low natural land cover, minimal protection, and will be greatly affected by climate change. Evolutionarily unique, narrow-range species are crucial for sustaining biodiversity in the face of environmental change. Our global study advances the current understanding of this imperilled yet previously overlooked facet of biodiversity.

However, it has been rarely studied in riverine system of farming regions, where small streams have been usually modified by a water gate and flood levee. This study was conducted to investigate dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC, DIC) in artificially modified tributary streams, namely the Desheng and Shuangqiao-Shiba streams, in a farming region of the lower Yangtze River basin. The results showed that the DOC and DIC concentrations had remarkable temporal-spatial variability in the Desheng and Shuangqiao-Shiba streams. The mean DOC concentrations were 5.4 and 6.7 mg L-1 in the Desheng and Shuangqiao-Shiba streams during the period of about 1 year, while the DIC concentrations were 14.0 and 9.6 mg L-1 in both streams, respectively. The DOC and DIC concentrations mainly showed the linear decreasing trends from source through to export in the spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The DOC concentration was almost always lower than the DIC concentration. The DOC concentration was positively correlated with the DIC concentration in the Desheng stream over the four seasons, indicating that the DOC and DIC potentially had similar sources. The DOC and DIC concentrations increased with sewage discharge, which introduced a potential hazard to human health. The water gate and flood levee in the Desheng and Shuangqiao-Shiba streams were constructed for discharging floods and recharging irrigation in the farming region, and their effects on dissolved carbon require further research.

Analyzing and summarizing the early propagation law can help reduce the losses caused by public health emergencies in the future. Early data on the spread of COVID-19 in 30 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) of mainland China except for Hubei, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan were selected in this study. Spatio-temporal analysis, inflection point analysis, and correlation analysis are used to explore the spatio-temporal characteristics in the early COVID-19 spread. The results suggested that (1) the total confirmed cases have risen in an "S"-shaped curve over time, and the daily new cases have first increased and finally decreased; (2) the spatial distributions of both total and daily new cases show a trend of more in the east and less in the west, with a "multi-center agglomeration distribution" around Hubei Province and some major cities; (3) the spatial agglomeration of total confirmed cases has been increasing over time, while that of the daily new cases shows much more obvious in the mid-stage; and (4) timely release of the first-level public health emergency response can accelerate the emergence of the epidemic inflection point. The above analysis results have a specific reference value for the government's policy-making and measures to face public health emergencies.

In total, 130 groundwater samples were collected comprising 116 from shallow groundwater (dug wells) and 14 from deep groundwater (drilled wells). The water samples were analyzed to determine the levels of As and 12 other heavy metals (Al, Cd, Mn, Cr, V, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Co, Pb, and Mo). The results showed that the concentrations of As and other heavy metals in the deep groundwater samples were lower than the safe limits, but the Cr concentrations in some shallow groundwater samples exceeded the safe limits. The heavy metal pollution index and heavy metal evaluation index both showed that As and other heavy metals were pollutants at low levels in all of the shallow and deep groundwater sample. Health risk assessments showed that the deep groundwater samples had no associated non-carcinogenic health risks, whereas the shallow groundwater samples had non-carcinogenic health risks due to contamination with Cr and As. Some shallow groundwater samples had associated carcinogenic health risks due to contamination with Cr and As, whereas the deep groundwater samples only had carcinogenic health risks because of contamination with Cr. These results suggest that local residents and government departments should be made aware of Cr and As pollution in shallow groundwater.

In this study, the role of classical PCA (cPCA) and robust PCA (rPCA) was evaluated explicitly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We evaluated 294 wheat genotypes under well-watered and rain-fed, focusing on spike traits. First, we showed that some phenotypic and genotypic observations could be outliers based on cPCA and different rPCA algorithms (Proj, Grid, Hubert, and Locantore). Hubert's method provided a better approach to identifying outliers, which helped to understand the nature of these samples. These outliers led to the deviation of the heritability of traits from the actual value. Then, we performed GWAS with 36,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on the traditional approach and two robust strategies. In the conventional approach and using the first three components of cPCA as population structure, 184 and 139 marker-trait associations (MTAs) were identified for five traits in well-watered and rain-fed environments, respectively. In the first robust strategy and when rPCA was used as population structure in GWAS, we observed that the Hubert and Grid methods identified new MTAs, especially for yield and spike weight on chromosomes 7A and 6B. In the second strategy, we followed the classical and robust principal component-based GWAS, where the first two PCs obtained from phenotypic variables were used instead of traits. In the recent strategy, despite the similarity between the methods, some new MTAs were identified that can be considered pleiotropic. Hubert's method provided a better linear combination of traits because it had the most MTAs in common with the traditional approach. Newly identified SNPs, including rs19833 (5B) and rs48316 (2B), were annotated with important genes with vital biological processes and molecular functions. The approaches presented in this study can reduce the misleading GWAS results caused by the adverse effect of outlier observations.

Globally, increased nitrogen (N) deposition has a significant impact on agricultural production; however, in-depth knowledge of oilseed crop yields and quality is still lacking. Here, we performed a global meta-analysis from 128 published papers with 462 paired observations to evaluate the response of oilseed crop yields, yield composition, protein, and oil content to simulated N deposition. The meta-analysis showed that simulated N deposition significantly increased oilseed crop yields in a dose-dependent and duration-dependent manner. The yield compositions were also changed by N deposition, where pod numbers per plant (PNP) and seed weights per pod were significantly increased. Interestingly, our analysis identified PNP as the key factor determining the oilseed crop yield response to simulated N deposition. Additionally, the form of N deposition had no striking influence on either yields or yield components, whereas differences in the sensitivity in rape responses reflected differences in crop species. In terms of oilseed crop quality, although simulated N deposition increased the seed protein content in a dose-dependent manner, there was a significant negative impact on the seed oil content. Furthermore, this negative correlation between seed oil content and biomass under simulated N deposition implies adverse effects caused by a dilution effect. Overall, our results suggest discrete responses of oilseed crop yield, seed protein and oil content to simulated N deposition. This study has ecological and biological implications for oilseed crop yield and quality responses facing global N deposition.

However, the responses of ecosystem C components to N fertilization and their relationships with soil water consumption under N fertilization remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the ecosystem C components and evapotranspiration under three N fertilizer rates application (0, 180 and 360 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), referred to as N0, N180 and N360, respectively) of two wheat varieties in three continuous growing seasons. We found that N fertilization increased all ecosystem C components as well as evapotranspiration. Excessive N application rates (N360) did not increase the net ecosystem C exchange (NEE) compared with that in the N180 treatment, which was mainly due to the larger increase in aboveground plant respiration (Rab) in the N360 treatment than the N180 treatment. The effects of N fertilization on NEE were larger than the effects on evapotranspiration, which led to an increase in water use efficiency (WUE). In addition, N fertilization increased soil respiration (Rs) by promoting both heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and root respiration (Ra), but a threshold effect of the N application rate on the Rs components was observed. Furthermore, the ecosystem C components showed different sensitivities to N fertilization, with Rab showing the highest sensitivity. Moreover, the changes in the C components were affected by the growing season and varieties, and mainly driven by biomass rather than by soil temperature or evapotranspiration. Our results demonstrate that N fertilization promoted ecosystem C fluxes, but that excessive N did not enhance the C fixation rate of the agroecosystem. These findings can inform global C-cycling models aimed at predicting C balances under N fertilization.

FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS												Many donor agencies give local residents in developing countries economic incentives to participate in activities related to the conservation of natural resources. The motivation crowding theory predicts that people's intrinsic motivation for conservation will decay after the initial monetary incentives are withdrawn. The purpose of this study was to show the effects of economic incentives on farmers' willingness to participate in a communal forest conservation initiative, using a simple questionnaire survey. We conducted a survey and collected household data from 782 farmers in 14 villages in the northern Ethiopian highlands and randomly placed them into two groups to compare their willingness to participate in conservation activities with and without economic in-centives. The results of econometric analyses reveal that payments to farmers reduce their intrinsic motivations for conservation. When the incentive was introduced and later removed, the participation rate was lower than in the original situation of no incentive. The introduction of a penalty for non-participation also reduces the motivation for conservation. The motivation is also lower for projects managed by external organizations rather than self-governed systems. These findings suggest that intervention programs for natural resource management should consider the sustainability of local people's motivations for conservation.

If cover crops are grown for forage they may raise more interest among farmers whether as feed or as income. The objective of this study was to evaluate if introducing annual winter cover crops will contribute to the yield and quality of annual forage production and will affect soil water content. The experiment included common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus) and their mixture as winter forage cover crops, fallow with nitrogen fertilization, and control plot (fallow without fertilization). The main crop was silage corn. A 2-year study was performed at three locations in northern Serbia. The following indices were calculated: forage productivity index (FP) as a ratio between cover crop and silage corn dry matter yield, forage cover crop yield advantage index (FCCYa) as a ratio between total forage yield on cover crop or fertilization treatment and control plot, and forage cover crop protein advantage index (FCCPa) as a ratio between total protein yield on cover crop or fertilization treatment and control plot. The total forage yield in 2012/2013 was higher due to more favorable weather conditions. FP was the highest on treatment with triticale in the first year and on the mixture in the second year. FCCYa was above 1, and higher on cover crop treatments in two locations. Introducing forage cover crops in crop rotation with silage corn showed an advantage in protein yield with all cover crop species, resulting in FCCPa above 1. Forage production at a location with lower FCCYa should be more focused on yield-quality balance. In contrast, in a temperate region in some years annual winter cover crops have a potential negative impact on available soil water storage for cash crop production compared to fallow-corn systems. Results indicate that cover crops impact the annual total forage yield and soil water content, but this alternation is not a species-specific effect. In the region with recurrent drought, forage yield uncertainty may be lessened by winter cover crops which enable reduced dependence on the main forage crop production.

Evaluating potential groundwater recharge in the unsteady state for deep-rooted afforestation in deep loess deposits	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Groundwater recharge reduces due to high transpiration from shallow-rooted to deep-rooted afforestation. However, reaching a steady state in recharge process is challenging and no methods are available for assessing potential ground-water recharge under unsteady state. Hence, this study developed a new method to quantify groundwater recharge in the unsteady state by (1) calculating the water age (A2) at maximum root depth (D2) for deep-rooted afforestation using the chloride accumulative age method; (2) determining the soil depth (D1) corresponding to A2 under shallow-rooted vegetation using the multi-year average pore water velocity multiplied by A2; (3) calculating the reduc-tion in groundwater recharge (Delta R) from shallow-to deep-rooted afforestation as the depth difference multiplied by the average water content between D1 and D2, divided by stand age. The average groundwater recharge for deep-rooted afforestation is equal to the average annual groundwater recharge under shallow-rooted vegetation minus Delta R. Soil cores with >25 m soil profiles below four land-use types of Hippophae rhamnoides Linn. (H. rhamnoides), Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco (P. orientalis), Robinia pseudoacacia L. (R. pseudoacacia), and grassland were collected to measure soil water content, root distribution, and chloride and tritium contents. The results revealed that: (1) maximum root depths were 11.0 +/- 0.5, 20.2 +/- 1.2, and 22.6 +/- 0.8 m, with soil water deficits of 373.48, 823.65, and 1847.92 mm under H. rhamnoides, P. orientalis, and R. pseudoacacia, respectively; (2) groundwater recharge following land-use change has not reached a steady state; (3) an average annual groundwater recharge was 89.12 mm yr-1					wu, wenjie/IUN-9258-2023; Siddique, Kadambot H.M./B-3462-2011; Si, Bing Cheng/H-8745-2012	Siddique, Kadambot H.M./0000-0001-6097-4235; Si, Bing Cheng/0000-0002-7497-5033; Chen, Guangjie/0000-0002-4518-7038													0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 1	2023	858		2						159837	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159837	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159837		NOV 2022						36411672					WOS:000898763000015

Contributions of three types of biocrusts to soil carbon stock and annual efflux in a small watershed of Northern Chinese Loess Plateau	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Accurate estimation of soil carbon (C) stock and efflux in drylands is vital for understanding the C cycling processes and predicting global climate change. As a "living skin ", biocrusts strongly change soil C fixation and respiration, but till now it is still challenging to accurately estimate and assess biocrust's contributions to soil C stock and efflux, especially taking different types of biocrusts and annual scale into consideration. In a small representative watershed on the northern Chinese Loess Plateau, cyanobacterial crust (cyano crust), cyanobacteria and moss mixed crust (mixed crust), moss crust, and bare soil were sampled. The organic C content of the samples were determined in laboratory, and subsequently their C stocks were calculated. Moreover, the respiration rate (Rs) of biocrusts and bare soil were repetitively measured in field for a four-month period, respectively, and an optimal regression model was established based on the relationship between Rs and corresponding temperature and moisture of soil. Lastly, the daily Rs was extended to a whole year through model extrapolation, and the seasonal and annual C efflux was obtained through summing the daily respiration together. Our results showed that (i) the organic C content of three types of biocrusts were 69 %-159 % higher than that of bare soil, and the soil C stock at depth of 0-5 cm was 0.35, 0.51, 0.81, and 0.61 kg m(-2) for bare soil, cyano crust, mixed crust, and moss crust, respectively. (ii) During the measurement period, the mean Rs of the four habitats were 1.13, 2.21, 2.86, and 2.56 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively, showing that the biocrusts increased Rs by 96 %-152 % in contrast to bare soil. (iii) The variations of Rs were best explained by soil temperature and moisture through the Gaussian model, which had the lowest AIC and RMSE. (iv) Based on model extrapolation, the estimated annual C efflux from bare soil, cyano crust, mixed crust, and moss crust were 228.0, 378.0, 894.0, and 679.0 g m(-2), respectively, indicating that in annual scale biocrusts increased C efflux by 66 %-292 % compared with bare soil. The seasonal variations also implied that the C efflux of biocrusts in summer and autumn were significantly higher than that in winter and spring, but they all accounted for a considerable proportion and should not be neglected. In conclusion, different types of biocrusts are the dominant contributors of soil C fixation and respiration in drylands. More importantly, the increased soil C efflux from biocrusts is highly overwhelmed by their elevated photosynthetic capacity, which make biocrusts sequestrate a considerable amount of C. These effects on soil C are highly associated with biocrust's roles in restoring degraded soil and mitigating global climate warming.

However, these differences, which are related to soil depths, remain unclear and are the subject of this study. We selected six sample plots (20 m x 50 m) in a natural Picea crassifolia forest in an alpine meadow to determine the vertical patterns (0 similar to 10 cm, 10 similar to 20 cm, 20 similar to 30 cm, and 30 similar to 50 cm) of soil bacterial and fungal communities, and to predict their potential functions. The phyla Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, and Proteobacteria dominated the soil bacteria, with more than 50% of the relative abundance, while the fungi Basidiomycota and Ascomycota dominated the soil fungi. The potential functions of bacteria, including metabolism and transcription, increased with soil depth, and corresponded to specific bacterial taxa. The functional guilds of fungi, including endophytes, arbuscular mycorrhiza, and ectomycorrhiza, did not change with soil depth. The structural equation modeling analysis revealed that soil organic carbon (SOC) and pH were the key drivers shaping the soil bacterial communities and potential functions in the 0-50 cm soil layer. SOC was also a key driver of soil fungal beta diversity. The sample plot, namely, its geographic locations, was another key driver shaping soil fungal b diversity and potential functions, but soil depth was not. Our results differentiate the importance of SOC and geographic location in shaping soil bacterial and fungal communities, respectively, and indicate that examining soil microbial composition and corresponding functions concomitantly is important for the maintenance and management of forest ecosystem functions.

For natural sand-bed rivers, dunes furnish the most significant contribution and this paper provides an insight on it. To achieve this aim, momentum balance equations and energy balance equations are applied to free flow in alluvial channels, assuming hydrostatic pressure distribution over the cross sections confining the control volume, which includes a reference bed form pattern. The resulting equation in terms of energy grade accounts for an empirical bed form drag coefficient resulting from the actual flow pattern and bed form geometry. The model has been validated using a large selection of field data and it seems somewhat sensitive to the dune geometry and to the Nikuradse equivalent roughness, whereas it is shows greater sensitivity to the adopted grain surface resistance formula (e.g., Manning-Strickler formula).

Here, the stability and long-term variability of streamflow components were analyzed for three less forested watersheds (LFWs, vegetation coverage 16-23% in 1970) undergoing major vegetation restoration (57-80% coverage in 2019), and for two largely forested watersheds (FWs, 65-68% cover in 1970 increasing to 88-92% in 2019) within the Beiluo River Basin on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Daily flow data for each watershed and year were normalized by rainfall to eliminate effects of non-stationary rainfall. Mean annual streamflow totals for the similar to 60-year study period were 25.1-34.1 and 21.6-48.1 mm y(-1) for the LFWs and FWs, respectively. Average contributions of baseflow to total streamflow were 32-44% for the LFWs and 58-61% for the FWs. Mann-Kendall tests showed significant decreasing trends for annual streamflow and stormflow (0.23-0.54% y(-1)) from the LFWs throughout. Mean streamflow from the LFWs between 2000 and 2019 decreased by 58% compared to the pre-2000 period, while the average contribution of stormflow decreased from 66% to 35% (2010s). However, winter baseflow increased with time since start of restoration. Conversely, streamflow (components) for the FWs showed only slight fluctuations in decadal, annual and seasonal trends. Both total streamflow and stormflow exhibited strong power relationships with vegetation coverage, illustrating a tendency towards stable flow regimes for vegetation coverage >60-70%. Large-scale vegetation restoration has fundamentally changed amounts and temporal distribution of streamflow (components) on the Loess Plateau mainly by regulating stormflow. After 20 years of restoration, the trend and proportion of streamflow components from the LFWs approximated those of the FWs. These results underpin the planning of sustainable management of natural resources vis-a-vis socio-economic development during long-term ecological restoration on the Loess Plateau.

Microbial metabolic limitations in these ecosystems, however, have rarely been studied. The objectives of this study are to reveal the characteristics of microbial nutrient limitation, and decipher the drivers in the alpine ecosystems. Methods Models of extracellular enzymatic stoichiometry were applied to examine and compare the metabolic limitations of the microbial communities in bulk and rhizosphere soils along an altitudinal gradient (2800-3500 m a.s.l.) under the same type of vegetation (Abies fabri) on Gongga Mountain, eastern Tibetan Plateau. Results The soil microbial communities suffered from relative C and phosphorus (P) limitations in the alpine ecosystem despite of high soil nutrient contents here. Partial least squares path modelling (PLS-PM) revealed that the limitations were directly regulated by soil nutrient stoichiometry, followed by nutrient availability. The C and P limitations were higher at the high altitudes (3000-3500 m) than that at the low altitude (2800 m), which mainly attribute to changes of soil temperature and moisture along the altitudinal gradient. This suggested that global warming may relieve microbial metabolic limitation in the alpine ecosystems, and then is conducive to the retention of organic C in soil. Furthermore, the C and P limitations varied significantly between the bulk and rhizosphere soils at the high altitudes (3200-3500 m), but not at the low altitudes. This indicated the influences of vegetation on the microbial metabolisms, while the influences could decrease under the scenario of global warming. Conclusions Our study suggests that the alpine ecosystems with high organic C storage harbour abundant microbial populations limited by relative C and P, which have sensitive metabolic characteristics. This could thus potentially lead to large fluctuations in the soil C turnover under climate change. The study provides important insights linking microbial metabolisms to the environmental gradients, and improves our understanding of C cycling in alpine ecosystems.

Under the condition of global climate change, which is introducing much uncertainty of precipitation patterns in this region, it is of special significance to investigate their responses to precipitation. Here, we investigated sap flow response to reduced throughfall. Stem sap flow was measured from 2011 to 2017 using Granier-type sensors. By placing waterproof panels within tree rows, about 47.5% precipitation was excluded from treated plots since April 2015. Differences in soil water content gradually increased to 4.3% between treated and control plots with continued throughfall exclusion. Decreased precipitation input significantly reduced the average sap flux density in treated plots by 9.1%-45.3%. The extent of this reduction depended on precipitation in the previous and current years. Transpiration and forest growth were negatively affected by the treatment. Furthermore, sap flow response to environmental factors became insensitive, with the discrepancy increasing with increasing drought duration, but was regained by rainfall recharge to soil water in the first two treatment years. However, prolonged drought might damage transpiration resilience capacity, as the saturated sap flux after soil water recharging during the wet period was still lower than that in the control plot in the latter year. Predawn leaf water potential was significantly lower in the treated plot compared to the control plot, whereas midday leaf water potential was similar. Whole tree hydraulic conductance (G(p)) was also similar between the two plots, except in extreme drought months when G(p) was much lower in the treated plot. In addition, the specific leaf area and stomatal density decreased in the treated plot. Therefore, decreases in precipitation would cause a transpiration reduction, weakening the tree's response to meteorological variables and lowering growth and productivity, potentially damaging transpiration resilience. These results suggest that black locust is sensitive to water changes, its capacity of drought tolerant is restrained by the drought time scale or drought severity, the use of such species in reforestation in semiarid regions should be implemented with caution.

However, currently, field measurements of compound erosion are rarely reported, probably due to the lack of generally accepted wind erosion measurement methods. In this study, an agricultural field at the northern end of the Loess Plateau was selected to measure the compound erosion from 2012 to 2014, in which water erosion was measured by runoff plots, while wind erosion was measured using BSNE samplers. The results indicated that: 1) annual water erosion ranged from 8.1 to 89.4 t ha(-1) a(-1) with a mean of 43.8 t ha(-1) a(-1), while wind erosion ranged from 0.82 to 2.12 t ha(-1) a(-1) with a mean of 1.58 t ha(-1) a(-1); 2) water erosion primarily occurred in the summer, while wind erosion occurred in the spring, and substantial variability was revealed on both the interannual and intra-annual scales for both erosion processes; 3) the compound erosion was temporally alternated and spatially overlaid in the selected field, and wind erosion only accounted for 3% of the compound erosion. Although water erosion greatly exceeded wind erosion for the selected agricultural field, the need for measuring and monitoring over a longer period to cover the natural variability of weather conditions is highlighted. The relative magnitude of water versus wind erosion was quantified, but more relevant studies are needed, since these studies usually have important implications for future studies and soil conservation practices.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				OCT 15	2019	352						104	115		10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.05.011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.05.011													WOS:000485207300011

We investigated the influence of the gradient levels of mean annual precipitation (MAP from 300 to 900 mm) on soil microbial metabolism in an arid and semi-arid grassland region located in Loess Plateau, China and identified relationships between microbial metabolic limitations and the variation of soil organic matter (SOM). Microbial metabolism in this arid and semi-arid region was limited by soil C and phosphorus (P) or nitrogen (N). Microbial C and P limitations decreased with the increase of MAP. Microbial C and P limitations were lowest in the areas with MAPs of 700-900 mm, whereas N limitation was observed in the areas with MAPs >700 mm. The results of a variation-partitioning analysis and partial least squares path modeling indicated that the microbial C and N/P limitations on regional scales were mainly determined by climate factors (MAP and mean annual temperature (MAT)), followed by vegetation biomass and soil properties. The extents of soil drying-rewetting processing caused by different MAPs directly affected microbial nutrient limitation. Our results suggested that the influence of precipitation variation on microbial metabolic limitation strongly governed SOM stability and that an increase in the rate of SOM decomposition with increasing precipitation could be caused by increased microbial nutrient limitation. SOM may be most stable at a MAP of 700 mm in the arid and semi-arid regions (300-900 mm MAP) where microbial nutrient limitation was lowest. This study provided novel insights into the responses of soil microbial metabolism to precipitation change and is an important step toward understanding the mechanisms of SOM stability in an arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystem under scenarios of precipitation variation.

J	Admasie, MA; Kurunc, A; Cengiz, MF				Admasie, Mulat Asmamaw; Kurunc, Ahmet; Cengiz, Mehmet Fatih			Effects of exogenous selenium application for enhancing salinity stress tolerance in dry bean	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE												Excess salinity is one of the most important abiotic stress that negatively affect plant growth and development. Like many other leguminous crops, dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), is classified as salt-sensitive plant. Researches related to the use of selenium to reduce salinity stress have been increasing in recent years. However, no study has been found in the world literature that shows the effects of this element on reducing salinity stress in dry bean. The main purpose of this study was to determine whether the negative effects of salinity stress on growth, yield, and organic compounds of dry bean could be reduced by foliar selenium applications. Three different foliar application dosages of selenium (0, 5 and 20 ppm) under four different irrigation water salinity levels (control0.6, low-1.6, moderate-3.0 and high-4.8 dS/m) were tested in the study. It has been shown that the foliar application of selenium, which is suggested to be used to reduce salinity stress in many plants, did not show, in general, a statistically positive trend for almost all growth, yield, and quality parameters in dry bean. Compared to the control salinity treatment, it was revealed that the application of 20 ppm selenium did not affect the salinity threshold value at a significant level, but this application had a very low positive effect on the slope value, which expresses the decrease in yield after the threshold salinity. In general, it was concluded that foliar application of selenium under studied concentrations had a minor effect than expected in improving the tolerance of salinity stress in dry bean.

Improving our understanding of the hydrological determinants of key life-history processes of fish, as well as the spatial scales over which these processes occur, is fundamental to inform effective recovery actions. We monitored the spawning response of native fish to a drought-breaking long-distance flow pulse that was protected from extraction by a legal intervention order in Australia's northern Murray-Darling Basin. Sampling sites were distributed across >1600 km of the Barwon-Darling River and three of its major tributaries. Larvae of the pelagophilic golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) were captured at all sites, with the size and age distribution indicative of both mainstem and tributary spawning. A mismatch between estimated hatch dates and river discharge at some locations suggested substantial flow-assisted dispersal from upstream spawning sites, although this was site-specific and more prevalent at downstream locations. Early life growth rates were the highest at tributary sites compared with mainstem sites, and within mainstem sites, golden perch grew faster in upper reaches compared with lower reaches. The present study provides insight into the environmental benefit of a post-drought protected flow event whereby connected lotic habitats promoted fish spawning and dispersal over a large spatial scale. Protection of future flow events should occur to support the conservation of golden perch and other pelagophil species, particularly following future drought periods which are forecast to become more intense and frequent.

A representative example is the Keriya River. To quantify the long-term dynamic variations in lower reach surface runoff of IRES, river length, defined as the distance between a selected fix point along the perennial river segment to its dynamic, ephemeral end, was used as an indicator. Using a total of 272 remote sensing images, we digitized and measured the distance (river length) between the center of Yutian County and the river's end point on each image, and then calculated monthly inter-annual and intra-annual variations in length of the lower Keriya River from 2000 to 2019. Hydrometeorological data were combined with descriptors of anthropogenic disturbances to assess the relative influence of natural factors and anthropogenic disturbances on lower reach river runoff. The results showed that intra-annual variations in river length fluctuated seasonally, with the minimum value occurring in June; two main peaks occurred in March and August. The minimum June value in river length was closely linked to an increase in agricultural water demand and a decrease in upper reach runoff. The August peak in river length was related to the peak values in upper reach runoff and agricultural water demand; upper reach runoff made a significant contribution because the former was about 20% more than the latter in summer. The March peak corresponded to elevated lower reach groundwater levels and to the melting of ice along river channels. Inter-annual variations in river length were due to inter-annual variations in upper reach runoff and middle reach agricultural water use which increased slightly during the study period. Inter-annual variations in frequency and amplitude of the fluctuations in river length were mainly controlled by changes in upper reach runoff. The minimum in river length in 2009 was consistent with the low in upper reach runoff of the Keriya River and other rivers in the Tarim Basin. The most significant factors controlling variations in river length are natural in origin.

EXPOSED TO MN STRESS	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES												Plant productivity is influenced by environmental conditions. Abiotic stresses limit yield potential in crops. Mn toxicity is an important constraint to crop production. In this study, whole genome association mapping was used in a spring barley population with 148 diverse genotypes for morphological traits underlying Mn stress. Association analysis between markers and phenotypic traits was performed with a mixed linear model (MLM with K+Q). A total of 39 significant markers were identified under both non stress and stress conditions. These markers were found on chromosomes 1H, 2H, 3H, 4H and 5H. Many of the associated markers were located in regions where QTL had previously been identified. Three significant markers on chromosomes 3H and 5H were associated with main spike length (MSL) and awn length (AL). Thus, it can be proved that MSL and AL have the same controller genomic regions. The results indicated that Mn tolerance was quantitatively inherited, and the detected QTLs may be useful for marker-assistant selection and identification of the genes controlling Mn tolerance in barley.																			1018-7081					APR	2020	30	2					384	390		10.36899/JAPS.2020.2.0032	http://dx.doi.org/10.36899/JAPS.2020.2.0032													WOS:000519271000015

The present study was conducted to assess the effect of nitrogen fertilizer rates and irrigation frequency on wheat crop growth and yield in the semi-arid region of Rajasthan, India. Twelve treatments with four replicas, combining four nitrogen fertilizers quantities (0, 50, 100, and 125% of recommended dose) with three irrigation intervals (15, 21, and 25 days after sowing) were used for three consecutive years (2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17). Crop responses were recorded for different growth stages (stem elongation stage, heading stage, and milking stage). The results showed that the high irrigation frequency and high fertilizer application significantly increased crop growth and yields. Yields observed in the first year of the experiment were higher than those in the second and third years in most treatments. One-way analysis of variance and Fisher's least significant difference pairwise multiple comparison tests were applied to determine significant changes in yield. The results showed that water and fertilizer are the key factors that can affect wheat yield in the semi-arid region of Rajasthan and should be managed according to soil and irrigation availability.																			2709-8028	2709-8036				JUL	2023	72	7					1211	1227		10.2166/aqua.2023.032	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/aqua.2023.032		JUN 2023											WOS:001019891700001

However, the response of these plant traits to plant-soil interactions at different successional stages remains poorly understood, which limits the understanding of secondary succession. A greenhouse experiment was designed to test the effects of rhizosphere soils collected from early- (EarlySoil), mid- (MidSoil), and late-successional (LateSoil) plant communities on plant traits of early-, mid-, and late-successional species (EarlySp, MidSp, and LateSp, respectively). We found that plant traits reacted in a specific direction to plant-soil interactions at different successional stages. Specifically, compared with treatments of plants growing in their own soil, the net photosynthetic rate and single-photon avalanche diode significantly increased in LateSp-EarlySoil (treatment of plants growing in soil) (20%-31%) and LateSp-MidSoil (10%-18%); the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II increased in MidSp-EarlySoil (1%) and LateSp-MidSoil (4%); belowground soluble sugar concentrations decreased in LateSp-EarlySoil (33%) and LateSp-MidSoil (45%); leaf, stem, and root biomass increased in MidSp-EarlySoil (76%-123%), LateSp-EarlySoil (180%-342%), and LateSp-MidSoil (83%-137%), and in turn they decreased in EarlySp-MidSoil (40%-73%) and EarlySp-LateSoil (53%-67%). The results indicated that soil conditioned by pre-successional species (early- or mid-successional species) would be conducive to plant functional traits of subsequent successional species (mid- or late-successional species). Constrained redundancy analysis and path analysis suggested that water-soluble ammonium N, total N, and available N concentrations were key soil factors affecting early-, mid-, and late-successional species, respectively. Our findings confirm the directionality of succession and provide new information for plant population dynamics during secondary succession.					li, xinghua/D-1775-2015	Xu, Hongwei/0000-0002-3628-3378														1999-4907				APR	2023	14	4							726	10.3390/f14040726	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f14040726													WOS:000978277500001

However, there are little available data providing evidence for the effects of trees associating with mycorrhizal type on belowground C and N cycling in forest ecosystems in China. Here, we collected a database of 26 variables related to belowground C and N cycling from 207 studies covering 209 sampling sites in China, to better understand the variations in belowground C and N cycling between the two mycorrhizal types in forest ecosystems along a climatic gradient. The AM forests had significantly lower soil total C and N contents, and soil microbial biomass C and N, than ECM forests, probably due to differences in litter quality (N and C/N) between AM and ECM forest types. In contrast, AM forests had significantly higher litter input, litter decomposition and soil respiration than ECM forests. Temperature and precipitation had significant positive effects on litter input and decomposition, soil total C and N contents, and soil respiration in AM and ECM forests. Overall, our results indicated that mycorrhizal type strongly affected belowground C and N cycle processes in forest ecosystems. Moreover, AM forests are likely more sensitive and ECM forests have a greater ability to adapt to global climate change.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564													1838-675X	1838-6768					2020	58	5					441	451		10.1071/SR19377	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR19377													WOS:000546619800003

It is well known that super-hydrophobicity reduces the friction between water droplets and the surface, thus allowing water drops to slide/roll and detach (clean) particles from surfaces. However, the forces that attach and detach particles from surfaces during the self- cleaning mechanism and the effect of nanotextures on these forces are not fully understood. To shed light on these forces and the effect of nanotexture on them, we prepared four Sibased samples (relevant to solar panels): (1) smooth or (2) nanotextured hydrophilic surfaces and (3) smooth or (4) nanotextured hydrophobic surfaces. In agreement with previous publications, it is shown that the efficiency of particle removal increases with hydrophobicity. Furthermore, nanotexture enhances the hydrophobicity, whereby particle removal is further increased. Specifically, hydrophilic particle removal increased from similar to 41%, from hydrophilic smooth Si wafers to 98% from superhydrophobic Si-based nanotextured surfaces. However, the reason for the increased particle removal is not low friction between the droplets and the superhydrophobic surfaces; it is the reduction of the adhesion force between the particle and the surface and the altered geometry of the water-particle-air line tension acting on the particles on superhydrophobic surfaces, which increases the force that can detach particles from the surfaces. The experimental methods we used and the criterion for particle removal we derived can be implemented to engineer self-cleaning surfaces using other surfaces and dust particles, exhibiting different chemistries and/or textures.

However, only limited information is available in literature on the manner through which the co-inoculation of PGPR and rhizobia can potentially supply nutrients to benefit plant growth in heavy metal contaminated soil. Accordingly, this study investigated the effects of Paenibacillus mucilaginosus (PGPR) and Sinorhizobium meliloti (rhizobia) co-inoculation on soil nutrients, enzyme activities, and microbial biomass in copper (Cu) contaminated soil planted with alfalfa (Medicago sativa). Moreover, we assessed soil bacterial community structure using high-throughput Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Results showed that PGPR and/or rhizobia inoculation improved alfalfa growth. In particular, we found that this co-inoculation approach decreased Cu accumulation (48.6%) in shoots compared to the control (uninoculated). Both partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) and the relative importance of regressors in the linear models identified that enzyme activities, microbial biomass, and microbial community structure in Cu contaminated soil were major controlling variables of soil nutrient availability. The co-inoculation treatment significantly increased soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations by increasing urease (55.6%), saccharase (29.5%), and beta-glucosidase (31.4%) activities compared to the control. Furthermore, the rhizosphere microbial community structure in the co-inoculation treatment was mainly regulated by soil N concentrations (i.e., both total N and available N) while altering alpha diversity (alpha-diversity). The relative abundances of Firmicutes (including biomarkers of the Bacillus genus) and Acidobacteria were enriched in the co-inoculated treatment, which can potentially improve soil nutrient availability and subsequently benefit plant growth. These findings indicated that the co-inoculation of PGPR and rhizobia plays an important role in promoting plant growth in Cu contaminated soil.

Snowfall is usually regarded as snow water equivalent in studying precipitation extremes, without considering the difference between snowfall and rainfall. Although snowfall is a key indicator of global change, no generally accepted and no unified indices for the assessment of snowfall extremes currently exist. The objectives of this study are to identify a suite of extreme snowfall indices that can be used to describe extreme snowfall events, and to analyse the dynamic changes in the extreme snowfall indices that have occurred in the Songhua River Basin (SRB), China. The study employs a dataset that contains daily data from 60-meteorological stations that cover a 55-year period. The results include a suite of extreme snowfall indices that can be used to assess extreme snowfall events. These extreme snowfall indices include four comprehensive indices, four intensity indices, four grade indices and two date indices. The total snowfall, the number of snowfall days, the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation, the snowfall intensity (SNI), the amounts of extreme snowfall and very extreme snowfall display insignificant trends over the entire SRB. The changes in the ending snowfall date exhibit a significant advancing trend (p < .001), while the changes in beginning snowfall date display a significant delaying trend (p < .05), which have led to a reduced snowfall season length (p < .001). These results provide a series of reference indices in describing snowfall extremes and they can enhance our understanding of the variations in snowfall that occur under global warming.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify how sheet and rill erosion affect soil aggregates and soil organic carbon losses for a Mollisol hillslope in Northeast China under indoor simulated rainfall.Materials and methodsThe soil used in this study was a Mollisol (USDA Taxonomy), collected from a maize field (0-20cm depth) in Northeast China. A soil pan with dimensions 8m long, 1.5m wide and 0.6m deep was subjected to rainfall intensities of 50 and 100mmh(-1). The experimental treatments included sheet erosion dominated (SED) and rill erosion dominated (RED) treatments. Runoff with sediment samples was collected during each experimental run, and then the samples were separated into six aggregate fractions (0-0.25, 0.25-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-2, 2-5, >5mm) to determine the soil aggregate and SOC losses.Results and discussionAt rainfall intensities of 50 and 100mmh(-1), soil losses from the RED treatment were 1.4 and 3.5 times higher than those from the SED treatment, and SOC losses were 1.7 and 3.8 times greater than those from the SED treatment, respectively. However, the SOC enrichment ratio in sediment from the SED treatment was 1.15 on average and higher than that from the RED treatment. Furthermore, the loss of <0.25mm aggregates occupied 41.1 to 73.1% of the total sediment aggregates for the SED treatment, whereas the loss of >0.25mm aggregates occupied 53.2 to 67.3% of the total sediment aggregates for the RED treatment. For the organic carbon loss among the six aggregate fractions, the loss of 0-0.25mm aggregate organic carbon dominated for both treatments. When rainfall intensity increased from 50 to 100mmh(-1), aggregate organic carbon loss increased from 1.04 to 5.87 times for six aggregate fractions under the SED treatment, whereas the loss increased from 3.82 to 27.84 times for six aggregate fractions under the RED treatment.ConclusionsThis study highlights the effects of sheet and rill erosion on soil and carbon losses at the hillslope scale, and further study should quantify the effects of erosion patterns on SOC loss at a larger scale to accurately estimate agricultural ecosystem carbon flux.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				JAN	2019	19	1					467	477		10.1007/s11368-018-2043-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-018-2043-y													WOS:000456207800043

Rainy years counteract negative effects of drought on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity: Resilience in annual plant communities	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Climate models forecast changes in the amount and distribution of rain, which may affect ecosystems worldwide, especially in drylands where water is already the limiting factor for plant life. Annual plant communities are common in drylands where they can complete their entire life cycle during the rainy period while avoiding the dry season. Moreover, seed dormancy allows them to disperse over time by remaining in the seed bank for long periods. However, the extent to which these communities will be able to tolerate increasing drought is uncertain. We performed a 5-year rainfall reduction treatment under field conditions and determined its effects on annual plant communities in a Mediterranean gypsum ecosystem. We assessed the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of these communities each year for 5 years. The taxonomic and functional diversity decreased under the rainfall reduction treatment, whereas the phylogenetic diversity increased. Moreover, the relative importance of species with drought-resistant functional designs increased in the community assemblages. However, after a rainy season with above average rainfall, all of the diversity values recovered completely even under the rainfall reduction treatment. Our results provide important insights into the responses of these plant communities under a climate change scenario, where they indicate high losses of diversity during drought events but rapid recovery in milder years. Synthesis. Our findings highlight the great resilience of annual plant communities in drylands, which may allow them to tolerate increased drought under the present climate change scenario.

However, studies focusing on the impact of drought on the SIF-GPP relationship have had mixed results at various scales, and the mechanisms controlling the dynamics between photosynthesis and fluorescence emission under water stress are not well understood. We developed a leaf-scale measurement system to perform concurrent measurements of active and passive fluorescence, and gas-exchange rates for winter wheat experiencing a one-month progressive drought. Our results confirmed that: (1) shifts in light energy allocation towards decreasing photochemistry (the quantum yields of photochemical quenching in PSII decreased from 0.42 to 0.21 under intermediate light conditions) and increasing fluorescence emissions (the quantum yields of fluorescence increased to 0.062 from 0.024) as drought progressed enhance the degree of nonlinearity of the SIF-GPP relationship, and (2) SIF alone has a limited capacity to track changes in the photosynthetic status of plants under drought conditions. However, by incorporating the water stress factor into a SIF-based mechanistic photosynthesis model, we show that drought-induced variations in a variety of key photosynthetic parameters, including stomatal conductance and photosynthetic CO2 assimilation, can be accurately estimated using measurements of SIF, photosynthetically active radiation, air temperature, and soil moisture as inputs. Our findings provide the experimental and theoretical foundations necessary for employing SIF mechanistically to estimate plant photosynthetic activity during periods of drought stress.

The Gully Land Consolidation (GLC), as a special type of land consolidation, significantly impacts soil erosion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the GLC on soil erosion and sediment yield under different rainfall events and hydrological years in the Xingshuyaozi watershed on the Chinese Loess Plateau, where the GLC area accounted for 10.36% of the watershed. A computer model integrated with the Chinese soil loss equation (CSLE) and the continuity equation of sediment was used. Sediment connectivity before and after the GLC was compared to illustrate the effect of the GLC on sediment yield. The results showed that the reduction in soil loss increased with increasing rainfall amount, and the reduction rate of soil erosion was over 50%. The GLC had the greatest effect on soil erosion in wet years. The GLC effectively decreased sediment at the outlet of the watershed, with over 99% of the sediment being trapped. The reduction efficiency of soil erosion and sediment yield decreased in order of wet year, normal year and dry year. The decreased soil erosion and sediment yield resulted from the significantly lowered slope gradients and sediment connectivity after the GLC. These results indicate that the GLC is an effective soil and water conservation measure. These results can provide technical support for the application of the GLC and policymaking.

Drip fertigation can synchronize the water and nitrogen (N) supply with crop demand, offering the potential for enhanced water productivity (WP) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). To quantitatively assess the efficacy of drip fertigation and identify the main affecting factors, we used a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of drip fertigation on the yield, WP and NUE under different conditions and to quantify the irrigation water saving potential (WSP) and N saving potential (NSP) of drip fertigation. Our results showed that, overall, drip fertigation led to significantly higher yields (12.0%), WP (26.4%) and NUE (34.3%), while significantly decreased crop evapotranspiration (ET) by 11.3%, compared to farmers' practices referring to traditional irrigation by furrow or flood and fertilization by broadcasting N fertilizer (broadcasting N fertilizer without irrigation in rainfed farming). However, the extent of improvement highly depended on crop types and was subject to edaphic, climatic and managerial factors. Among crop types, potato showed the highest increase in yield (40.3%) and WP (100.3%), and fruit showed the highest increase in NUE (68.2%). At a regional scale, drip fertigation performed best in semiarid regions. In addition, irrigation water inputs had large effects (P < 0.05) on the magnitude of yield, ET, and WP response, while N inputs had significant effects (P < 0.05) on yield and NUE but not on WP and ET. The results of WSP and NSP indicated that water input under drip fertigation for maize, wheat, potato, tomato and cotton could be further decreased by 14% (41 mm), 22% (87 mm), 20% (42 mm), 20% (59 mm) and 13% (50 mm), and N input could be further decreased by 23% (68 kg N ha(-1)), 26% (88 kg N ha(-1)), 33% (60 kg N ha-1), 21% (117 kg N ha(-1)) and 23% (66 kg N ha(-1)), respectively, without crop yield reduction.

The importance of spatial and temporal scale in describing hydrogeomorphic character of riverine landscapes	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Context Describing the hydrogeomorphic character of rivers in a holistic way is essential to understanding the processes whereby freshwater ecosystems maintain patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. A key question in carrying out this characterisation is the temporal and spatial scales which best represent differences and similarities between habitats. Objectives The purpose of this study is to describe the hydrological and geomorphological character of a large river-floodplain system (the Upper Mississippi River, USA) at multiple spatial and temporal scales in order to holistically determine the physical template influencing the riverine ecosystem. Methods Seventeen variables are used to describe the hydrogeomorphic character of 99 backwaters and floodplain lakes along a 100 km reach of the river. Results At the landscape scale (10 s of km), position in the landscape and proximity to neighbouring habitats contributed most to variability in hydrogeomorphic character. At the smaller patch scale (10-100 s of m), the shape of entry to the patch and water depth were distinguishing variables. In relation to temporal variables, habitats are distinguished by decadal scale variables describing the historic nature of the rise and fall of connection events, and mean peak and duration of connection over long periods. In contrast, the interplay of magnitude and duration of individual connection events produced unique patterns at the short-term temporal scale (intra-annual). Analysis of all variables across all scales showed that no variable from one scale of observation was dominant, rather variables from multiple scales are contributing to hydrogeomorphic character to varying degrees. Conclusions This work demonstrates how an interdisciplinary, multi-scale approach is critical in detecting unique patterns in hydrogeomorphic character across different spatial and temporal scales. This approach enables a holistic view of spatio-temporal heterogeneity of a system and provides a firm basis for investigating how the physical template influences and helps to maintain patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem processes in complex and dynamics systems.					; Thompson, Ross/D-7996-2013	Miller, Cara/0000-0002-6642-918X; Thompson, Ross/0000-0002-5287-2455; Reid, Michael/0000-0002-3948-9347													0921-2973	1572-9761				SEP	2021	36	9					2763	2779		10.1007/s10980-021-01269-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-021-01269-9		JUN 2021											WOS:000656810500002

The study of genetic diversity in a minicore collection of durum wheat genotypes using agro-morphological traits and molecular markers	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												The evaluation of genetic diversity in a gene pool contributes to the effective selection of genotypes and truncates the breeding time. In the present study, 96 durum wheat genotypes were evaluated for (1) genotypic diversity using two DNA marker systems: CAAT box-derived polymorphism (CBDP) and inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers and (2) phenotypic diversity using several drought-adaptive traits under rainfed conditions for two cropping seasons. Our results revealed that the ISSR primers produced 99 bands across the genotypes, the average of which was 6 fragments per primer, whereas CBDP primers generated 70 polymorphic bands, with an average of 5.3 fragments per primer. The values of marker index (MI) and polymorphism information content (PIC) indicated that CBDP markers were more efficient than ISSR markers for detection of genetic diversity in durum wheat. The average of PIC values for the CBDP and ISSR markers were 0.40 and 0.23, respectively. Based on the values of Shannon index (I) ICARDA population had a higher than CIMMYT population and the heterozygosis values confirmed these results. Dendrogram was created with a neighbor-joining clustering method. The studied genotypes were divided into five and seven groups based on data from the CBDP and ISSR markers, respectively, which was supported by principal coordinate analyses. The results of genotype by trait biplot analysis showed different patterns of interaction accessions and traits across years. High level of diversity among the studied accessions based on each studies trait was observed.

Thirty districts with 74 soil profiles from Madhya Pradesh state were considered for the study. However, we are presenting the average results over districts and soil profiles. A well-parameterised and validated APSIM model was used to simulate the effects of temperature and rainfall on maize grain and biomass yield. Increase in temperature having negative effects on both grain and biomass yield of maize. While increasing the temperature from base to 5 degrees C, the grain and biomass yield of maize decreased by 40% and 28%, respectively. Further, increasing the temperature by 1 degrees C could reduce the grain and biomass yield by 10% and 8 %, respectively. A small increase in maize yield was observed by 10% decrease of rainfall from the base. While rainfall increase by 10% or more and decrease by >20% would results in lower maize yield and biomass. The decrease in maize yield due to increase in temperature could be attributed to decrease in duration of the crop. One-degree increase in temperature may decrease the duration of crop by 4.3 days. This study also revealed that agronomic management practices such as delaying of sowing dates could reduce the impact of climate change on crop yield to a considerable extent. By adopting the sowing date between 7th and 14th July, it may be possible to reduce the impact of temperature change on maize grain and biomass yield in central Indian condition.

Analysing the spatial-temporal variations of global terrestrial GPP became capable with the increasing length of satellite data. Previous studies mainly focused on evaluating the model performance or investigating the mean, the temporal trend or the interannual variability (IAV) of global terrestrial GPP based on one single or multiple models, which is difficult to identify common merits of a same cluster of GPP models. This study compared eight satellite-based LEU-type GPP models in capturing the mean, temporal trend and IAV of global GPP concurrently. Our results showed that current common-used models based on LUE methodology estimated global mean GPP ranging from 128.5 to 158.3 Pg C year(-1), and global mean IAV ranging from 0.1 to 0.35, but the trends ranging from -0.22 to 0.51 Pg C year(-1). In the context of plant functional types (PFTs) and climate classifications, no consistent feature for either of the mean, trend or IAV of GPP are identified among eight models. Future studies should integrate the latest advances on the mechanisms and associated environmental factors into models and consolidate performance of models to better understand the evolutions of terrestrial ecosystem functioning.

In this study, extracellular enzymatic stoichiometry models and quantitative PCR techniques were used to examine microbial metabolic limitation and its relationship with N-cycling gene expression in semi-arid agricultural ecosystems considering four N fertilization levels (N 0, N 100, N 250, and N 400 kg N ha(-1)) and two agronomic strategies (film mulching and no mulching). Film mulching increased microbial C limitation (reflecting microbial C metabolism size; 0.189 of the total effects), while very small effects on microbial phosphorus (P) limitation were observed (-0.007 of the total effects). N fertilization increased the microbial demand for P (microbial P limitation; 0.504 of the total effects). Increased microbial C metabolism was mainly attributed to increased soil moisture content after film mulching, which enhanced microbial decomposition of organic C (high C-acquiring enzyme activities). Changes in nutrient stoichiometry and the increase in N availability due to N fertilization were largely responsible for increased microbial P limitation. Furthermore, microbial P limitation negatively affected the abundance of AOA amoA, AOB amoA (involved in nitrification), nirK, nirS, nosZ (involved in denitrification) genes, strongly inhibiting nitrification and denitrification potential (-0.743 and -0.761 of the total effects, respectively). The present results suggest that agricultural ecosystems with film mulching are conducive to organic residue decomposition, while appropriate P limitation under N fertilization could reduce the loss of N due to nitrification and denitrification in soil. This study highlights the importance of elemental stoichiometry-driven microbial metabolic variation in understanding soil nutrient cycles and optimizing agricultural practices.

This innovative study is designed to quantify the ecohydrological effectiveness of litter crusts in desert ecosystems. We focus on the positive effects of litter crusts on soil water holding capacity and water interception capacity compared with biocrusts. Litter crusts significantly increased soil organic matter compared to biocrusts and bare lands, by 2.4 times and 3.8 times, respectively. Higher organic matter content resulted in increased soil porosity and decreased soil bulk density. Meanwhile, soil organic matter can help to maintain maximum infiltration rates. Litter crusts significantly increased the water infiltration rate under high water supply. Our results suggested that litter crusts significantly improve soil properties, thereby influencing hydrological processes. Litter crusts play an important role in improving hydrological effectiveness and provide a microhabitat conducive to vegetation restoration in dry sandy ecosystems.

Screening potential topsoils is a necessary step to determine the suitability of materials for revegetation. This study aimed to obtain insights into the growth of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) on homogeneous and layered initial soils prepared with local natural materials (sandy soil and montmorillonite-enriched sandstone), before screening the optimal topsoil for alfalfa growth. Ten technosols were assessed in a growth study over 5 months by using the biomass production and root system as performance indicators. The shoot and root biomass production were highest in the treatment with a 20 cm montmorillonite-enriched sandstone layer at a depth of 20-40 cm, where the biomass production rate was approximately twice that in sandy soil. The root distribution according to the depth was more even in a homogeneous mixture of sandy soil combined with montmorillonite-enriched sandstone and the treatment with a 20 cm montmorillonite-enriched sandstone layer at a depth of 20-40 cm compared with the other eight options, possibly due to the higher water-holding capacity of the montmorillonite-enriched sandstone. The optimal technosol was determined as a 20 cm montmorillonite-enriched sandstone layer at a depth of 20-40 cm in a sandy matrix. The results of this study using locally sourced components for preparing topsoil could facilitate the development of strategies for mine reclamation.						junchao, jia/0000-0003-3456-0252													0925-8574	1872-6992				MAY	2019	130						101	109		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.01.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.01.014													WOS:000463884100010

This study investigated sediment yield and sources by using a simple fingerprinting method in a dam-controlled watershed on the northern Loess Plateau. The sampling sediment profile exhibited 24 flood couplets corresponding to rainfall storms from 2001 to 2014. A total of 2.05 x 10(5) t sediment was trapped during the period. The annual sediment yield varied from 0 to 430 t ha(-1) year(-1), with an average annual sediment yield of 146.1 t ha(-1) year(-1). Ten sediment properties (i.e., sigma C-13, sigma N-15, TOC, TN, C/N, X-lf, X-hf, X-fd, Cs-137, Pb-210) were potentially selected to identify the sediment sources. The multivariate discriminant function analysis (DFA) test suggested that three soil properties (X-hf, TN, and Cs-137) comprised the optimum composite fingerprinting. The results demonstrated that sandstone contributed nearly 90% of sediment in 2012 and 56.1% in 2003. The contribution from arable land varied from 5.2% in 2005 to 44.6% within the period of 2013-2014. On average, approximately 74.06% of sediment originated from the weathered sandstone, followed by 15.67% from arable land, and the remaining 10.27% from uncultivated land. Our finding indicated that bare sandstone was the main sediment source, leading to relatively high sediment yield in the study area. This study provides a method with great potential for sediment yields assessment and sediment source identification in ungauged watersheds on the Loess Plateau.

We propose a framework based on a response surface method to comprehensively explore spatial scale sensitivity of the cellular automata Markov chain (CA-Markov) model, and present a hybrid evaluation model for expressing simulation accuracy that merges the strengths of the Kappa coefficient and of Contagion index. Three Landsat-Thematic Mapper remote sensing images of Wuhan in 1987, 1996, and 2005 were used to extract land use information. The results demonstrate that the spatial scale sensitivity of the CA-Markov model resulting from individual components and their combinations are both worthy of attention. The utility of our proposed hybrid evaluation model and response surface method to investigate the sensitivity has proven to be more accurate than the single Kappa coefficient method and more efficient than traditional methods. The findings also show that the CA-Markov model is more sensitive to neighborhood size than to cell size or neighborhood type considering individual component effects. Particularly, the bilateral and trilateral interactions between neighborhood and cell size result in a more remarkable scale effect than that of a single cell size.

We evaluated the cyto-genotoxic and clastogenic effects of antitrypanosomal plants; Lonchocarpus laxiflorus (LL) and Afrormosia laxiflora (AL) and their impact on hepatic metabolomics in Wistar rats.MethodsThe IC50 was determined based on malondialdehyde (MDA) level (ex vivo). This was followed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 8-hydroxy-2 '-deoxyguanosine (8OHDG), DNA fragmentation (DF) and micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs) determinations. Hepatic metabolites of exposed rats to the said plants' extracts were identified by LC-MS coupled with a positive control group treated with sodium arsenite (SA).ResultsThe IC50s of LL and AL are 2.545 and 5.693 mu g/ml, respectively, for liver tissue and 4.440 and 5.877 mu g/ml, respectively, for bone marrow tissue. In bone marrow tissue, low cyto-genotoxicity potentials based on LDH and 8OHDG levels as compared with SA were observed. At in vivo level, we observed significant (p < 0.05) reduction of MDA, LDH, 8OHDG, DF and MNPCEs levels relative to SA-treated rats. Based on metabolomics, tyrosine, sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways were likely activated in SA-treated group and shut down in LL- and AL-treated groups with concomitant stabilization of sphingolipid metabolism in SA + LL- and SA + AL-treated rats. However, AL-treated group showed activation of phenylalanine metabolism. ConclusionAltogether, AL depicts insignificant (p > 0.05) cyto-genotoxicity and ability to cause chromosomal breakage ex vivo and in vivo, indicating that decoction of AL appears to be safe for the treatment of human trypanosomiasis.

J	Mukai, S; Billi, P; Haregeweyn, N; Hordofa, T				Mukai, Shiro; Billi, Paolo; Haregeweyn, Nigussie; Hordofa, Tilahun			Long-term effectiveness of indigenous and introduced soil and water conservation measures in soil loss and slope gradient reductions in the semi-arid Ethiopian lowlands	GEODERMA												Across the world, on-site and off-site effects of soil erosion accelerated by anthropogenic land-use/cover changes have been partly offset by the implementation of soil and water conservation (SWC) measures. However, studies evaluating the effectiveness of SWC over longer periods are currently rare. The dimensions of the terraced fields and SWC were measured at 242 sample fields that had slope gradients between 2.0 and 6.5% in three villages in the semi-arid Ethiopian Rift Valley (Ethiopian lowlands). In the study area, both indigenous contour weed hedgerows (denber) and introduced bund techniques, such as soil and stone bunds, are observed as major SWC measures. The establishment of the oldest SWC dated back to 65 years ago. Long-term effectiveness of the SWC was assessed in terms of the reduction in soil loss rates and slope gradient change of the terraced fields. Long-term quantitative assessment of SWC across the world has been conducted only in highlands; however, no case studies were conducted in lowlands. It is partly because the model that assessed the long-term effectiveness of SWC measures for the highlands appears to be inapplicable to lowlands. In the lowland model used in this study, the mid-point of the field was connected with that of the upper and lower fields by straight lines, which were assumed to represent the original slopes before the SWC establishment. The difference in slope gradient between the present slope and the original slope of the field without SWC was used for the estimates of slope reduction. The measured mass of the soil loss zone of the field was used to determine the long-term mean intrafield soil loss rate, while that of the sediment deposition zone was used to determine the long-term mean intrafield sediment accumulation rate behind the lower SWC. The mean net soil loss from the terraced fields was 19.6 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), which was higher than that in the semi-arid northwestern highlands (Tigray); however, that from the stone bund fields was 13.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), which was lower than that in Tigray. The soil and stone bunds retained 52-72% of the intra-field soil loss, compared to 34% retained by the denber. Slope gradients were reduced annually by 0.03% grade for the denber fields and 0.17-0.28% grades for the soil and stone bunds fields. Uncertainty analysis proved these estimates had relative uncertainty of <10% in general. All the SWC measures investigated in this study were effective in reducing soil loss from cropland and in reducing slope gradients of cropland in Ethiopian lowlands. Farmers' efforts to place eliminated weeds on the lower hedgerows and bunds and a subsequent regeneration mechanism of weed hedgerows sustain the long-term effectiveness of not only denbers but also other bunds even without any extra maintenance efforts by farmers in the Rift Valley.

The coexistence of various heavy metal pollutants leads to biotoxicity and alters the activity of microorganisms. Soil microbial metabolism plays an important role in nutrient cycling and biochemical processes of soil ecosystem. However, the effects of heavy metal contamination on microbial metabolism in soil are still unclear. This study aims to reveal the responses of microbial metabolic limitation to heavy metals using extracellular enzyme stoichiometry, and further to evaluate the potential impacts of heavy metal pollution on soil nutrient cycle. The results showed that soil microbial metabolism reflected by the ecoenzymatic activities had a significant response to soil heavy metals pollution. The metabolism was limited by soil carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) under varied heavy metal levels, and the increase of heavy metal concentration significantly increased the microbial C limitation, while had no effect on microbial P limitation. Microorganisms may increase the energy investment in metabolism to resist heavy metal stress and thus induce C release. The results suggest that energy metabolism selected by microorganisms in response to long-term heavy metal stress could increase soil C release, which is not conducive to the soil C sequestration. Our study emphasizes that ecoenzymatic stoichiometry could be a promising methodology for evaluating the toxicity of heavy metal pollution and its ecological effects on nutrient cycling.

J	Ding, WB; Wang, F; Jin, K				Ding, Wenbin; Wang, Fei; Jin, Kai			Effects of Rainfall and Plant Characteristics on the Spatiotemporal Variation of Soil Moisture in a Black Locust Plantation (<i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i>) on the Chinese Loess Plateau	WATER												Soil moisture is a key factor controlling vegetation construction and ecological restoration in arid and semiarid areas. Understanding its spatiotemporal patterns and influencing factors is essential for effective vegetation water management. In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of black locust plants using field investigations and statistical analyses and determined the effects of the rainfall and plant characteristics on the soil moisture content (SMC) in a typical watershed in the Loess Plateau, China. The results show that the SMC increases with increasing distance from the tree trunk in the horizontal direction. The vertical profile of the SMC includes layers characterized by rapid decrease, decreased fluctuation, and slow increase. Temporal SMC changes exhibit higher variabilities in the surface layer than in deeper soil layers. Rainfall characteristics notably affect soil moisture. The influence of the rainfall amount is stronger than that of the rainfall duration and intensity. The diameter at breast height, tree height, and canopy width positively affects the soil moisture, whereas the leaf area index and canopy openness negatively affect it. The results of this study provide insights into soil moisture change mechanisms and theoretical references for sustainable plant water use management in arid and semiarid areas.

Compared with satellite remote sensing, the high spatial resolution remote sensing images obtained by UAVs at low altitudes are rich in detailed information. In addition, different varieties of wheat have different traits, which makes it easy to misclassify categories in the process of semantic segmentation, which reduces the classification accuracy and affects the classification effect of ground object. In order to effectively improve the classification accuracy of ground object in complex wheat field scenes, two Multi-Scale U-Nets based on multi-scale feature fusion are proposed. Multi-Scale U-Netl is a network model that adds a multi-scale feature fusion block in the copy process between U-Net encoding and decoding. Multi-Scale U-Net2 is a network model that adds a multi-scale feature fusion block before U-Net inputs an image. Firstly, the wheat field planting area of Institute of Water-saving Agriculture in Arid Areas of China (IWSA), Northwest A&F University was selected as the research area. The research area was planted with a variety of wheat with various types of traits, and some traits were quite different from one another. Then, multi-spectral remote sensing images of different high spatial resolutions in the study area were obtained by UAV and transformed into a data set for training, validation, and testing of network models. The research results showed that the overall accuracy (OA) of the two Multi-Scale U-Nets reached 94.97% and 95.26%, respectively. Compared with U-Net, they can complete the classification of ground object in complex wheat field scenes with higher accuracy. In addition, it was also found that within the effective range, with the reduction of the spatial resolution of remote sensing images, the classification of ground object is better.																				2073-4395				NOV	2022	12	11							2658	10.3390/agronomy12112658	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12112658													WOS:000880718700001
J	Gu, CJ; Zhu, YQ; Li, RH; Yao, H; Mu, XM				Gu, ChaoJun; Zhu, Yongqing; Li, Renhua; Yao, He; Mu, Xingmin			Effects of different soil and water conservation measures on hydrological extremes and flood processes in the Yanhe River, Loess Plateau, China	NATURAL HAZARDS												The runoff and sediment load of the Loess Plateau have changed significantly due to the implementation of soil and water conservation measures since the 1970s. However, the effects of soil and water conservation measures on hydrological extremes have rarely been considered. In this study, we investigated the variations in hydrological extremes and flood processes during different periods in the Yanhe River Basin (a tributary of the Loess Plateau) based on the daily mean runoff and 117 flood event data from 1956 to 2013. The study periods were divided into reference period (1956-1969), engineering measures period (1970-1995), and biological control measures period (1996-2013) according to the change points of the annual streamflow and the actual human activity in the basin. The results of the hydrological high extremes (HF1(max), HF3(max), HF7(max)) exhibit a decreasing trend (P < 0.01), whereas the hydrological low extremes (HBF1(min), HBF3(min), HBF7(min)) show an increasing trend during 1956-2013. Compared with the hydrological extremes during the reference period, the hydrological high extremes increased during the engineering measures period at low (< 15%) and high frequency (> 80%), whereas decreased during the biological control measures period at almost all frequencies. The hydrological low extremes generally increased during both the engineering measures and biological control measures periods, particularly during the latter period. At the flood event scale, most flood event indices in connection with the runoff and sediment during the engineering measures period were significantly higher than those during the biological control measures period. The above results indicate that the ability to withstand hydrological extremes for the biological control measures was greater than that for the engineering measures in the studied basin. This work reveals the effects of different soil and water conservation measures on hydrological extremes in a typical basin of the Loess Plateau and hence can provide a useful reference for regional soil erosion control and disaster prevention policy-making.																			0921-030X	1573-0840				OCT	2021	109	1					545	566		10.1007/s11069-021-04848-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-021-04848-w		JUN 2021											WOS:000661051300004

Population density affects intraspecific competition and many other aspects of insect life history. However, there is limited information on the interactive effects of these factors on insects. Here, we tested the interactive effects of three diurnal temperature amplitudes (22 +/- 0 degrees C, 22 +/- 6 degrees C, and 22 +/- 12 degrees C) and three population densities on the development, survival, longevity, and fecundity of the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Homoptera: Aphididae). At a constant temperature, increasing population density reduced the growth and survival of early-instar nymphs, increased longevity, and reduced fecundity. At a low population density, increasing temperature amplitude inhibited nymph development. However, even at a high temperature amplitude, nymph survival rate was higher than expected, and reproduction was possible because the recovery of the lower night-temperatures eliminated thermal stress. Increasing the population density reduced, and even reversed, the negative effects of the wide temperature amplitude. This may reflect synergistic interactions between population density and wide temperature amplitude as these stressors each incur energetic costs.These findings emphasize the importance of temperature amplitude and population density for improving prediction accuracy and damage assessment during pest control modeling.					xing, k/JEP-6928-2023	Zhao, Fei/0000-0003-4158-3604														1536-2442				MAR 10	2021	21	2							6	10.1093/jisesa/ieab011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jisesa/ieab011		MAR 2021						33693804					WOS:000641627200001

Purpose This study was conducted to determine the quantitative effect of poultry litter (PL) amended with inorganic agro-industrial byproducts on aggregate and hydrological properties of a sandy loam soil. Materials and methods Poultry litter (PL) unamended or amended with quicklime (CaO), flue gas desulfurization gypsum (FGDG), Al-2 (SO4)(3)center dot 18H(2)O (alum), cement kiln dust (CKD), crushed ag lime (CaCO3), or biochar was applied to a sandy loam soil and incubated at room temperature for 30 days. Aggregate stability and water retention of the mixture were measured after the incubation. Results Amending PL with all byproducts, relative to the unamended PL, increased the stability of 0.25-2 mm aggregates and mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates. But only Ca-rich byproducts increased macro-aggregates (> 2.0 mm) stability by as much as 21.7%. The C-rich biochar reduced macro-aggregate (> 2.0 mm) stability by 18% compared to the PL alone. All byproducts increased soil field capacity (FC) and plant available water (PAW), and Ca-rich byproducts decreased water content at permanent wilting point (PWP), while biochar greatly increased water content at PWP. All Ca-rich byproducts increased PAW by an average of 49% over no Ca byproducts. Conclusion Our results overall showed that Ca-rich inorganic byproducts, some of which are commonly applied to agricultural soils, are effective PL amendments for improving soil aggregation and water holding properties.

Multi-temporal glacier coverage is essential for mass balance estimations and understanding glacial changes in response to climate variability. However, consistent multi-temporal glacier area datasets across the HMA are limited due to challenges posed by seasonal snow and cloud cover in remote sensing satellite images. In this study, a new method is proposed to estimate glacier and nonseasonal snow (GNS) areas by combining the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) and bright temperature bands from Landsat remote sensing images in 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s. Meanwhile, the integrated ice dynamic Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM) is applied to simulate nine typical glaciers and project their changes using 15 general circulation models (GCMs) under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The results showed that total GNS areas in HMA were estimated at 71.26 x 103 km2 in the 1990s, and decreased to 53.17 x 103 km2 in the 2020s. Massive proportions of GNS were mainly distributed in the southeast and northwest region. Tipping points of GNS indicating a transition from mass balance gain to loss during four periods were detected in the Upper Tarim basin, Inner Tibetan Plateau, Upper Yangtze river basin, Upper Brahmaputra river basin, and Upper Salween river basin. The reduction of total GNS area was attributed to significantly rising temperature and decreasing solid precipitation. The projections indicate that glacier shrinkages will be the dominant trend in the future, and most typical glaciers will experience a mass loss of 60% under SSP245 (SSP2-RCP4.5) and over 90% under SSP585 (SSP5-RCP8.5) by the end of the century. The response of glaciers to climate change is also found to be influenced by factors including local topography and elevation ranges.

It is urgent to develop sustainable remediation materials to protect and restore the contaminated soil and aquifers in mining areas. The feasibility of applying Pisha sandstone (PS) and Na+-modified Pisha sandstone (Na-PS) for adsorption of heavy metals was evaluated. Na-PS exhibited maximum Cd(II) and Cu(II) removal rates of 65.9% and 99.8%, respectively, exceeding the corresponding values for PS (8.2% and 1.3%, respectively) in 1 x 10(-3) M solution. Efficient heavy metals adsorption occurred in the pH range 5.0-6.0. The adsorption of Cu(II) and Cd(II) on PS and Na-PS was characterized by kinetic models and adsorption isotherms and was well represented by pseudo-second-order kinetics (R-2 > 0.99) and the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. The values of the thermodynamic parameters indicated that the interactions were spontaneous endothermic reactions. Binary solutions adsorption isotherms indicated that the linearity of the adsorption amount and initial concentration of Cu(II) and Cd(II) was better in certain ranges and the adsorbents were selective towards Cu(II) rather than Cd(II). Therefore, PSs can be used as excellent adsorbents for Cu(II) and Cd(II) remediation from contaminated surface water.

J	Yang, Y; Liu, DD; She, DL				Yang, Ya; Liu, Dongdong; She, Dongli			Simulating the effects of vegetation restoration and climate change on the long-term soil water balance on the Loess Plateau, 2021-2050	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In water-limited areas, soil water content (SWC) is a critical factor for plant growth and ecosystem stability. To understand the long-term effects of three different land uses (Vigna radiata: VR, Stipa bungeana: SB, and Medicago sativa: MS) and two climate scenarios (representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP45) and nonclimate change (Non_CC)) on water budgets and the mechanisms of dried soil layer (DSL) formation, a new complete multilayered model, OpenKarHydro, was developed. The results showed that the model adequately captured the water budget for different land uses, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.058, 0.046, and 0.046 and coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.615, 0.605, and 0.582, respectively, for SWC dynamics. This model performance was also demonstrated by the verification of runoff. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the soil porosity (n) was the most sensitive parameter in all land uses. The DSL was primarily caused by higher evapotranspiration (VR: 83.16% vs. 82.48%, SB: 80.62% vs. 77.69%, and MS: 79.93% vs. 76.26%) and canopy interception (VR: 11.92% vs. 11.99%, SB: 17.56% vs. 23.15% and MS: 22.60% vs. 26.19%) in the Non_CC climate pattern than in the RCP45 climate pattern. Climate change has caused an increase in evapotranspiration and interception for all land uses, reducing bottom leakage. Rainfall is sufficient to meet the water demand in the VR plot regardless of climate change; however, the additional water consumption caused by climate warming cannot be offset by the increased rainfall for the SB and MS plots. Compared to Non_CC, RCP45 resulted in increases of 0%, 54.19%, and 57.62% in proportion with extreme drought and decreases of 4.70%, 38.74%, and 5.24% in proportion with no drought for the soil profiles of VR, SB, and MS, respectively. For MS, RCP45 (2026) caused the DSL to penetrate the soil profile (>400 cm) 4 years earlier than in the Non_CC (2030), which should take no more than 5 and 9 years, respectively. OpenKarHydro is a useful tool for optimal water resource management and ecological restoration in water-limited areas.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2023	626		A						130260	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130260	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130260													WOS:001092969400001
J	Lu, SB; Chen, YM; Sardans, J; Pen, JS				Lu, Senbao; Chen, Yunming; Sardans, Jordi; Pen, Josep			Ecological stoichiometric comparison of plant-litter-soil system in mixed-species and monoculture plantations of<i> Robinia</i><i> pseudoacacia,</i> Amygdalus davidiana, and Armeniaca sibirica in the Loess Hilly Region of China	FOREST ECOSYSTEMS												We examined how afforestation patterns impact carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) stoichiometry in the plant-litter-soil system. Plant leaf, branch, stem, and root, litter, and soil samples were collected from mixedspecies plantations of Robinia pseudoacacia with Amygdalus davidiana (RPAD), R. pseudoacacia with Armeniaca sibirica (RPAS), and monocultures of R. pseudoacacia (RP), A. davidiana (AD), and A. sibirica (AS) in the Loess Hilly Region. The results showed that in mixed-species plantations, R. pseudoacacia had lower leaf N and P concentrations than in monocultures, while both A. davidiana and A. sibirica had higher leaf N and P concentrations. Soil P limited tree growth in both afforestation models. Mixing R. pseudoacacia with A. davidiana or A. sibirica reduced N-limitation during litter decomposition. Average soil total N and P concentrations were higher in RPAS than in RPAD, and both were higher than the corresponding monocultures. The average soil C:N ratio was the smallest in RPAS, while the average soil C:P ratio was larger in RPAS than in RP. A positive correlation between N and P concentrations, and between C:N and C:P ratios, was found in litter and all plant organs of mono- and mixedstands. Alternatively, for N concentration and C:N ratio, the correlations between plant (i.e., leaf, branch, root) and litter and between plant and soil were inverse between plantation types. RPAD has an increased litter decomposition rate to release N and P, while RPAS has a faster rate of soil N mineralization. RPAD was the best plantation (mixed) to improve biogeochemical cycling, as soil nutrient restrictions, particularly for P-limitation, on trees growth were alleviated. This study thus provides insights into suitable tree selection and management by revealing C:N:P stoichiometry in the plant-litter-soil system under different afforestation patterns.

J	Liu, HH; Liu, J; Zhang, XW; Liu, XY				Liu, Honghu; Liu, Jing; Zhang, Xianwei; Liu, Xinyu			The Shrink-Swell Process of the Granite Residual Soil with Different Weathering Degree in a Gully System in Southern China	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL												The soil shrink-swell phenomenon produces crack networks and slope instability. However, few studies have involved the continuous shrink-swell process of granite residual soils. The objective of the study is to explore the shrink-swell process of weathered granite soils and its effects on gully development in southern China. The bulk density, soil water content (SWC), shrink-swell ratio (SSR), clay mineral content, and mechanical composition, etc., of soil samples from five soil layers (at depths of 0.3 m, 3.0 m, 7.0 m, 12.0 m, and 16.0 m) along a profile in Yudu County was analyzed. After quantifying the soil properties at different soil depths, we analyzed these data statistically in an effort to identify strong parametric relationships. The results indicated that some properties such as bulk density and shear stress increased with soil depth, while other soil properties, such as plasticity index and liquid limit, were inversely related to depth. Soil cohesion, the angle of internal friction, and shear stress were closely related to the SWC. Every 1% decrease in the SWC resulted in a shear stress reduction of 6.62 kPa. The SSR values exhibited significant variation between the three dry-wet cycles and were closely related to the bulk density values of our kaolin and montmorillonite samples. As an environmental factor, the SWC can trigger changes in internal soil properties such as shear stress and the SSR. Using these data and observations made during our field survey, it can be proposed that continuous shrink-swell variation in deep granite-weathering crust can result in crack formation and gully erosion. It can be inferred that crack development velocity and gully retreat rate may be affected by the soil's shrink-swell process. Consequently, this information provides insight to understanding the mechanism of gully development in southern China.

LULC changes and cropping patterns were quantified using multi-temporal Landsat images from 1990 to 2018. Our finding revealed that between 1990 and 2018, agriculture, build-up, and water bodies increased by 52.22%, 5.44%, and 2.06% respectively, at the cost of decreasing barren land (50.27%), sand (5.05%), and shrubland (4.41%). Similarly, between 1997 and 2017, crop types such as sugarcane, and rice field increased by 19.77%, and 1.79%, whereas wheat decreased by 22.23%. We found that CRBC significantly altered the LULC of the study area, resulting in favorable changes in land-cover and cropping patterns, emphasizing the relevance of irrigation projects.

The relative importance value and niche breadth were used as comprehensive quantitative indices to characterize the status, role, and degree of dominance of plant species in the community. We found that relative importance value and niche breadth were higher overall in shrub species than in most grass species, except B. ischaemum. Meanwhile, the relative importance value was significantly correlated with plant phosphorus concentration, plant carbon:nitrogen ratio, rhizosphere soil organic carbon, rhizosphere soil total nitrogen, rhizosphere soil total phosphorus, rhizosphere bacterial alpha-diversity. A stepwise regression analysis indicated that, among the plant and rhizosphere characteristics of these species, only their rhizosphere bacterial alpha-diversity and plant root carbon concentration primarily influence ecological niche patterns of these plant species in the community. In summary, our study reveals that shrub species occupy more advantageous ecological niches than grass species in a stable community due to the active rhizosphere interactions, providing a new opportunity to disentangle the mechanisms underlying the plant community assembly in grassland.

J	Wang, B; Feng, PY; Waters, C; Cleverly, J; Liu, DL; Yu, Q				Wang, Bin; Feng, Puyu; Waters, Cathy; Cleverly, James; Liu, De Li; Yu, Qiang			Quantifying the impacts of pre-occurred ENSO signals on wheat yield variation using machine learning in Australia	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Australia is one of the top wheat exporting countries in the world and the reliable prediction of wheat production plays a key role in ensuring regional and global food security. However, wheat yield in Australia is highly exposed to the impacts of climate variability, especially seasonal rainfall, as wheat is mostly grown in the drylands. Previous studies showed that El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a strong influence on Australia's climate and found the ENSO-related phenomena have prognostic features for future climatic conditions. Therefore, we examined the predictability of state-scale variation in Australian wheat yields based on ENSO-related large-scale climate precursors using machine learning techniques. Here, we firstly established a set of random forest (RF, a machine learning method) models based on pre-occurred climate indices to forecast spring rainfall for the four major wheat producing states of Australia, the forecasted rainfall was then combined with selected precedent climate drivers to predict yield variations using another set of RF models for each state. We explored the most influential variables in determining spring rainfall and yield variation. We found that the first set of RF models accounted for 43-59% of the change in spring rainfall across the four states. By incorporating forecasted spring rainfall with selected ENSO climate indices, the RF model accounted for 33-66% of the variation in yield which was greater than the 22-50% of yield variations explained by ENSO-related indices alone. The results suggest that wheat yield variation at a state level could be reliably forecasted at lead-times of three months prior to the commencement of harvest. We also found that forecasted spring rainfall and precedent Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) in July were the most important factors in estimation of crop yield in the winter dominant rainfall states. ENSO climate indices are easy to obtain and can be rapidly used to drive the forecasting model. Therefore, we believe the proposed models for predicting wheat yield variations at three-month lead time would be helpful for state governments and policy makers to develop effective planning to reduce monetary loss and ensure food security.

A series of in-situ simulated rainfall experiments with rainfall intensities ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 mm min(-1) were conducted to explore the runoff characteristics and erosion dynamic processes of four engineered landforms, namely, waste slag heap with more gravel (WSG), waste slag with more sand (WSS), waste soil heap (WSH) and disturbed land (DL), with undisturbed land (UL) as the control (CK). Compared with UL, the WSS, WSG and WSH runoff rates (RRs) increased by 38.83%, 71.39% and 63.16%, respectively, but decreased by 9.25% for DL. The slope flow of UL was in the subcritical laminar and subcritical transition flow regimes, while the four engineered landform flow regimes were mainly subcritical transition and subcritical turbulent flow regimes. The UL and DL soil loss rates (SLRs) followed a declining-fluctuating-levelling off trend, while the WSS, WSG and WSH SLRs followed a trend of multiple early-stage peaks and valleys before levelled off. The mean WSS, WSG, WSH, and DL SLRs were 11.19 times, 138.67 times, 73.47 times and 2.82 times that of UL, respectively. UL disturbance significantly increased the runoff ability to detach sediments by 2.48 94.90 times based on the relationships between runoff rate and soil loss rate. The shear stress (tau), stream power (omega), and unit stream power (U-p) critical values initiating DL soil erosion were 58.86%, 37.06% and 56.67% lower than those of UL, respectively, while higher critical hydrodynamic values were required to detach WSG, WSS and WSH particles. The rainfall intensity (RI), slope gradient, median particle size (D-50) fractal dimension (FD) and U-p were employed to develop an empirical model for predicting engineered landform SLRs.

The bacterial community structure and diversity are usually studied using high-throughput sequencing that cannot provide direct evidence for ARB changes. Thus, little is known about the distribution of ARB, especially in the presence of different antibiotics in composting process. In this study, the fate of ARB was investigated in aerobic composting of swine manure, using chlortetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, lincomycin, and ciprofloxacin as typical antibiotics. The abundance and species of ARB were analyzed systematically to evaluate their ecological risk at different stages of composting. Results The absolute abundance of total ARB decreased, while the relative abundance increased on day 2. The relative abundance of lincomycin-resistant bacteria was higher than other ARBs during the whole composting process. The absolute abundance of four ARBs was 9.42 x 10(6)-2.51 x 10(2) CFU/g (lincomycin- > chlortetracycline- > sulfamethoxazole- > ciprofloxacin- > multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria), and they were not completely inactivated at the end of composting. Antibiotics led to a partial proliferation of ARBs including Corynebacterium, Sporosarcina, Solibacillus, and Acinetobacter. Especially, Corynebacterium, a pathogenic genus, was observed in chlortetracycline and lincomycin treatments. Conclusion Among the antibiotics studied, lincomycin showed the highest ecological risk, due to it expanded the range of lincomycin-resistant bacteria at the phyla level (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria). The principal co-ordinates analysis indicated that the bacterial community structure was primarily associated with the composting stages rather than antibiotic types. Possible potential hosts and the related to the decrease of ARGs abundance were indicated based on the network analysis. The decrease of culturable Proteobacteria and the increase of culturable Firmicutes (Solibacillus, Bacillus) partially explained the high degradation rate of various ARGs with the progress of composting in this study. These results provided important information for the control of antibiotic resistance in composting.

Those changes are often viewed as the main cause of accelerated erosion rates. We studied the impact of land use changes on soil erosion processes in one of the watersheds in Montenegro: the Miocki Potok, using this watershed as a pilot river basin for this area. We simulated responses of soil erosion processes by using a process-oriented soil erosion Intensity of Erosion and Outflow (IntErO) model, with different settings of land use for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. The model provides fast, effective, and affordable insight into the effects of land use change on soil erosion processes. Testing of the applied procedures was important for the further establishment of watershed management methodologies at the national level, for the other 300 river basins of Montenegro. For the current state of land use, calculated peak discharge for the Miocki Potok was 364 m(3) s(-1) (2020)-372 m(3) s(-1) (1970) for the incidence of 100 years, and there is a possibility for large flood waves to appear in the studied basin. Real soil losses, G(year), were calculated at 13680 m(3) year(-1) (2020) and specific 333 m(3) km(-2) year(-1) (2020). A Z coefficient value of 0.439 (2020) indicated that the river basin belongs to destruction category III. The strength of the erosion process was medium, and according to the erosion type, it was mixed erosion. According to our analysis, the land use changes in the last 50 years influenced a decrease in the soil erosion intensity for 14% in the Miocki Potok River Basin. Further studies should be focused on the detailed analysis of the land use changes trends with the other river basins at the national level, closely following responses of soil erosion to the changed land use structure, and effects of plant-and-soil interaction on soil erosion and sediment dynamics.

Colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and supply of phosphorus (P) fertilizer may affect the bioavailability of Se in soils and the absorption of Se by plants. To investigate the interaction between AMF and P fertilizer on the transformation of soil Se fractions and the availability of Se in the rhizosphere of alfalfa, we conducted a pot experiment to grow alfalfa in a loessial soil with three P levels (0, 5, and 20 mg kg(-1)) and two mycorrhizal inoculation treatments (without mycorrhizal inoculation [-AMF] and with mycorrhizal inoculation [+AMF]), and the interaction between the two factors was estimated with two-way ANOVA. The soil in all pots was supplied with Se (Na2SeO3) at 1 mg kg(-1). In our results, shoot Se concentration decreased, but plant Se content increased significantly as P level increased and had a significant positive correlation with AMF colonization rate. The amount of total carboxylates in the rhizosphere was strongly affected by AMF. The amounts of rhizosphere carboxylates and alkaline phosphatase activity in the +AMF and 0P treatments were significantly higher than those in other treatments. The concentration of exchangeable-Se in rhizosphere soil had a positive correlation with carboxylates. We speculated that rhizosphere carboxylates promoted the transformation of stable Se (iron oxide-bound Se) into available Se forms, i.e. exchangeable Se and soluble Se.

However, the difference in SOC response to the two kinds of afforestation modes (mixed plantation and pure plantation) remained controversial at present. This study conducted a synthesis to estimate afforestation modes effect on SOC sequestrations based on 218 filed observations in China. The results showed that mixed plantations preserved more SOC sequestrations than pure plantations in China. The SOC sequestration rates (RS) in 0-20 cm layer of mixed and pure plantations were 0.89 and 0.32 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Particularly, the RS of arbor-shrub mixtures (0.97 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) was the highest among all mixed plantations. Generally, the RS was increased first and then decreased since afforestation, with the peaking value of 1.20 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) during 6-10 years. Moreover, afforestations on cropland had a higher RS compared to that on barren lands or woodlands, and reforestations on woodlands usually led to SOC loss. Compared with high-temperature and high-precipitation environments (C-rich regions), afforestation in low-temperature and low-precipitation environments (C-deficit regions) had the higher RS. Overall, conducting mixed plantations, especially arbor-shrub mixtures, was more beneficial to promote SOC sequestration than pure plantations. The findings suggest that mixed plantations should be taken into accounting in future afforestation projects in the view of improving the carbon benefits of the ecosystem.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Yu, Zhijing/0000-0001-7619-9499													0378-1127	1872-7042				FEB 1	2023	529								120654	10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120654	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120654		NOV 2022											WOS:000896950900003

In 2015, we randomly set up five experimental plots with precipitation gradients on the natural restoration grassland of the Loess Plateau (natural precipitation, NP; +/- 40% natural precipitation: decreased precipitation (DP), DP40; increased precipitation (IP), IP40; +/- 80% natural precipitation: DP80; IP80). In the third and fifth years after the experimental layout (spanned two years), we explored the cbbL-genes, which are functional genes in the Calvin cycle, harboring microbial diversity and community composition under different precipitation treatments. The results showed that the increase in mean annual precipitation significantly changed the cbbL-harboring microbial alpha diversity, especially when controlling for 40% natural precipitation. The response of the dominant microbial communities to interannual increased precipitation variation shifted from Gammaproteobacteria (Bradyrhizobium) to Betaproteobacteria (Variovorax). The structural equation model showed that precipitation directly affected the cbbL-harboring microbial diversity and community composition and indirectly by affecting soil NO3- (mg N kg(-1)), soil organic matter, dissolved organic N content, and above-and underground biomass. In conclusion, studying how cbbL-harboring microbial diversity and community composition respond to uneven precipitation variability provides new insights into the ecological processes of C -fixing microbes in semi-arid naturally-restored grasslands dominated by the Calvin cycle.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				SEP 10	2022	838		2						156191	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156191	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156191		MAY 2022						35618124					WOS:000809654900012

Vegetation restoration has been widely adopted to prevent soil degradation given its role in improving soil nutrients and soil erodibility. However, it is unclear which vegetation type has the best improving capacity from soil nutrient and soil erodibility perspectives. This study selected three vegetation restoration types of grasslands (GL), shrublands (SL), and forestlands (FL) along the five slope positions (i.e., top, upper, middle, lower, and foot slope), to investigate the effects of vegetation restoration types on soil nutrients and soil erodibility. All vegetation restoration types were restored for 20 years from croplands (CL). We used comprehensive soil nutrient index (CSNI) and comprehensive soil erodibility index (CSEI) formed by a weighted summation method to reflect the effect of vegetation restoration on the improving capacity of soil nutrient and erodibility. The results showed the vegetation types with the highest comprehensive soil quality index (CSQI) at the top, upper, middle, lower and foot slope were FL (1.92), FL (1.98), SL (2.15), FL (2.37) and GL (3.93), respectively. When only one vegetation type was considered on the entire slope, SL (0.59) and FL (0.59) had the highest CSNI, the SL had the lowest CSEI (0.34) and the highest CSQI (1.89). The CSNI was mainly influenced by soil structure stability index (SSSI), sand content, silt + clay particles, and CSEI was controlled by soil organic matter (SOM), macroaggregates and microaggregates. Moreover, the CSQI was influenced by pH, silt and clay content, and biome coverage (BC). The study suggested the SL were advised as the best vegetation restoration type on the whole slope from improving soil nutrients and soil erodibility.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Wu, Jianzhao/0000-0003-3124-1109; Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564													0301-4797	1095-8630				JAN 15	2022	302		A						113985	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113985		OCT 2021						34700089					WOS:000711330000007

We have optimized the ratio of the three synthesized polymers using an orthogonal design of experiments and characterized this hydrogel using SEM, BET and FTIR spectra. We have added the hydrogel into soil and investigated its degradability in soil and its influence on chemical and physical properties of soil, such as maximum water holding capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, water retention curve and nutrient retention and evaluated its performance when applied in drought stress tests on tobacco plants. The results show that the maximum water absorption of optimized L/KJ/SA is 41.23 g/g. Adding the L/KJ/SA hydrogel to soil reduces saturated hydraulic conductivity, increases available water capacity of soil and reduces leaching of soil nutrient. The L/KJ/SA hydrogel can improve the photosynthetic capability of tobacco plants under drought stress and the levels of osmotic regulators such as proline and reducing sugar, and could prolong the growth time of tobacco plants up to 14 days, which significantly increases its mass harvest. The L/KJ/SA hydrogel also has good degradability, which can degrade 20% when buried in soil for 120 days. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study estimates the terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes from 2003 to 2017 using a water balance approach over seven large basins in China. The estimated inter-annual variations and trends in TWS correspond well with those obtained from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment observation. Variance analysis shows that annual precipitation in northern China plays a more important role in controlling annual TWS variability than that in southern China. This increased sensitivity is primarily attributed to the limited availability of water resources and the arid climate conditions prevalent in northern China. Interestingly, actual evapotranspiration is the dominant driver, contributing more than 55% to the declining trend in TWS in two northern basins: Hai River and Yellow River basins, where the leaf area index has strongly increased. Precipitation and evapotranspiration account for over 89% of the TWS trend over basins in northeastern China. Meanwhile, the dominant drivers for TWS in southern China are precipitation (50%-54%) and runoff (33%-41%). Our results suggest that it requires strong ecological conservation actions in order to keep water resources sustainable in northern China. Terrestrial water storage is a vital component of the global hydrological cycle, especially in regions with serious water resource issues, including shortages and disparities in spatiotemporal distribution. This study found that precipitation is the dominant driver of the trends in terrestrial water storage change over southern China. Comparatively, the dominant driver is actual evapotranspiration over northern China, which is caused by the strong increase in the leaf area index in the Hai River and Yellow River basins.

However, information regarding how the erosion processes and control efficiency on spoil heaps differ as functions of grass types and components is lacking. In this study, a series of artificial rainfalls (48, 72, and 108 mm h(-1)) were conducted on eight plots (each one was replicated) that were established on steep spoil heaps and treated with three different grass types (Artemisia gmelinii (AG), Medicago sativa (MS), and Cynodon dactylon (CD)), with measurements of the runoff generation, sediment yield, and runoff velocity. Bare plot (BS) was set up as a control. Three scenarios regarding erosion efficiencies that by intact grass (IG), a combination of grass stems and roots (NL), and only grass root (OR), were considered. The results showed: 1) grass recovery can significantly reduce soil loss rate (SLR) on spoil heaps up to 99%, and there was no significant difference in erosion reduction efficiency between grasses with a taproot (AG: 93%) and fibrous root (MS: 92%; CD: 89%) systems under the IG treatments (P > 0.05); 2) The effect of the different grass treatments on SLR reduction depended on the rainfall intensity. The contribution rate of roots to SLR reduction was 68%-90% at a rainfall intensity of 48 mm h(-1), while the stem and leaf contribution rates were 39%-156% at intensities of 72 and 108 mm h(-1), respectively. While incomplete grass even increased the SLR, especially in the OR treatment, where the contribution rate of root to SLR reduction was -2%- -68%. 3) The IG treatment reduced soil erodibility (K-r) by 81.43%-83.80%, while the K-r values of the OR treatment were 1.51-3.53 times greater, as compared to the BS plots. In most cases, the critical shear stress (tau(c)) on the grass plots was 1.09-2.14 times greater than those in the BS plots. These results would guide the selection of grass species for controlling spoil heaps erosion, also highlight the necessity of maintaining grass to maximize its control efficiency.

The rapid and accurate identification of apple targets in an illuminated and unstructured natural orchard is still a key challenge for the picking robot's vision system. In this paper, by combining local image features and color information, we propose a pixel patch segmentation method based on gray-centered red-green-blue (RGB) color space to address this issue. Different from the existing methods, this method presents a novel color feature selection method that accounts for the influence of illumination and shadow in apple images. By exploring both color features and local variation in apple images, the proposed method could effectively distinguish the apple fruit pixels from other pixels. Compared with the classical segmentation methods and conventional clustering algorithms as well as the popular deep-learning segmentation algorithms, the proposed method can segment apple images more accurately and effectively. The proposed method was tested on 180 apple images. It offered an average accuracy rate of 99.26%, recall rate of 98.69%, false positive rate of 0.06%, and false negative rate of 1.44%. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method.

While knowledge exists on how the secondary succession of plants affects soil physicochemical properties and soil ecoenzymatic activity, less is known about how soil ecoenzymatics change during this process. We investigated five typical stages of the entire succession process of vegetation on the Loess Plateau, China. These stages included: (1) farmland stage (0 years), (2) grassland stage (30 years), (3) shrub land stage (60 years), (4) the pioneer forest stage (100 years), (5) the climax community stage (160 years). Soil ecoenzymatic activity, microbial biomass, and soil physicochemical properties were measured. Our research showed secondary succession significantly changed soil enzyme activity, and the metabolic activity of soil microorganisms significantly declines as secondary succession progresses. N limitation in the soil microbial community was weak initially and then gained strength. P nutrient limitation was strong initially, and then weakened. Soil ecoenzymatic C : N : P acquisition ratios deviated from 1 : 1 : 1. Thus, secondary succession on the Loess Plateau is nutrient dependent, but not homeostatic. Soil physicochemical properties and plants were important factors for soil enzyme activities. In addition, soil available nutrients were better than soil total nutrients to reveal changes in soil ecoenzymatic activities and stoichiometry. This study demonstrated the regularity of soil nutrient cycling during the secondary succession of vegetation, providing new insights on the mechanisms of nutrient flow.					chen, wenjing/IZE-8536-2023														1085-3278	1099-145X				JAN 15	2021	32	1					399	409		10.1002/ldr.3723	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3723		SEP 2020											WOS:000564472800001

In this study, we cloned the heat responsive gene TaHSP23.9 from wheat (Triticum aestivum) based on TMT-labeled quantitative proteomic analysis in our previous work and examined its function in the response of transgenic Arabidopsis to heat and salt stress. Amino acid alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that TaHSP23.9 contained a typically conserved structure of the alpha-crystallin domain and is closely related to OsHSP23.2 in rice. Transient expression assays demonstrated that TaHSP23.9 is located on the endoplasmic reticulum. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that TaHSP23.9 was expressed much more in filling grains under normal conditions and was significantly upregulated by heat and salt stress. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively over-expressed TaHSP23.9 had no visible differences or adverse phenotypes compared with the wild type under normal conditions but exhibited enhanced tolerance to heat and salt stress under stress conditions. In addition, we found that the expression level of TaHSP23.9 was significantly higher in the heat-tolerant wheat varieties than in the heat-sensitive varieties. Our results suggest that TaHSP23.9 may function as a protein chaperone to positively regulate plant responses to heat and salt stress and could be developed as a molecular marker for screening heat-tolerant wheat varieties.

INFLUENCE OF N SPLIT APPLICATION ON NH<sub>3</sub> VOLATILIZATION LOSSES AND N RECOVERY EFFICIENCY FROM PLASTIC MULCHING MAIZE IN LOESS PLATEAU, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Ammonia (NH3) volatilization is one of the main reasons of applied-N loss from agricultural cropping systems. Adjusting the application timing of N fertilizer to improve temporal synchronicity between crop-N demand and soil-N availability could result in higher nitrogen (N) recovery efficiency (NRE) and lower N losses. A two-year experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of split fertilizer N application on NH3 volatilization, grain yield, and NRE. Four treatments were included according to the N application ratio: (i) a single application of total N fertilizer at sowing (N1), (ii) N applied with two splits at a ratio of 4:6 (N2), (iii) N applied with three splits at a ratio of 4:3:3 (N3), and (iv) no N applied as a control (N0). The results show that NH3 fluxes peaked at 3-5 days after fertilization and then dropped sharply within the next week. NH3 fluxes increased significantly with N application rate and were significantly and positively correlated with soil NH4+-N content. Slight precipitation (< 10 mm) promoted NH3 volatilization, while heavy precipitation (> 10 mm) restrained it. Applying N with two or three splits significantly increased the grain yield, total N uptake, and NRE of maize and significantly reduced NH3 volatilization losses.

Seed protein content and its relationships with agronomic traits in pigeonpea is controlled by both main and epistatic effects QTLs	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The genetic architecture of seed protein content (SPC) and its relationships to agronomic traits in pigeonpea is poorly understood. Accordingly, five F-2 populations segregating for SPC and four agronomic traits (seed weight (SW), seed yield (SY), growth habit (GH) and days to first flowering (DFF)) were phenotyped and genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing approach. Five high-density population-specific genetic maps were constructed with an average inter-marker distance of 1.6 to 3.5 cM, and subsequently, integrated into a consensus map with average marker spacing of 1.6 cM. Based on analysis of phenotyping data and genotyping data, 192 main effect QTLs (M-QTLs) with phenotypic variation explained (PVE) of 0.7 to 91.3% were detected for the five traits across the five populations. Major effect (PVE = 10%) M-QTLs included 14 M-QTLs for SPC, 16 M-QTLs for SW, 17 M-QTLs for SY, 19 M-QTLs for GH and 24 M-QTLs for DFF. Also, 573 epistatic QTLs (E-QTLs) were detected with PVE ranging from 6.3 to 99.4% across traits and populations. Colocalization of M-QTLs and E-QTLs explained the genetic basis of the significant (P < 0.05) correlations of SPC with SW, SY, DFF and GH. The nature of genetic architecture of SPC and its relationship with agronomic traits suggest that genomics-assisted breeding targeting genome-wide variations would be effective for the simultaneous improvement of SPC and other important traits.

This potentially introduces variations when differently-sized soil aggregates experience progressive thawing and detachment. In this study, a Mollisol was dry-sieved into three particle sizes (<0.125, 0.125-0.5 and 0.5-1 mm). Each was refilled into a soil column, rewetted to saturation, frozen at -15 degrees C for 12 h, and then thawed at ambient temperature. During thawing, the soil columns were peeled by layers from the outermost to the inner core into six layers (T1 similar to T6), to simulate soil detachment while progressive thawing. Our results show that: 1) The outermost layer T1, thawed earlier and thus peeled off first, had the highest water content (102.1-151.2 %) but the lowest electrical conductivity (EC, 63.2-68.3 mu S.cm(-1)). On the contrary, the inner core T6, thawed the last, was driest with merely 24.1-28.4 % water content yet higher EC of 61.0-87.0 mu S.cm(-1). Such polarized distributions were most pronounced among the soil layers composed of fine aggregates. 2) The CO2 emission rates from the T1 were in general lower than that from the T6 (on average 56.1-65.6 vs. 70.0-84.8 mu g CO2-C.g soil(-1) 7d(-1)). The soil columns composed of fine aggregates released significantly less CO2 than the coarser aggregates. Overall, the convection of free water during freezing and the diffusion of ice-insoluble materials from freezing front to unfrozen zones, collectively resulted in the polarized patterns of soil water, solute and CO2 emissions. This challenges the conventional investigations based on complete freeze-thaw, highlighting the necessity to distinguish inter-layer heterogeneity during progressive thawing. The varying responses of differently-sized aggregates call for systematic investigations on how progressively thawing and detachment affect slope-scale carbon biogeochemical processes.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2022	219								106614	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106614	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106614		SEP 2022											WOS:000860223400007

However, the relationship among root size, yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) is controversial. Two pot experiments were conducted to explore these relationships by using two maize varieties with contrasting root sizes and reducing the root-shoot ratio (R/S) through root pruning to eliminate genotypic effects. Maize plants were grown in an open rainout shelter under both water-sufficient and deficient conditions. Yield-related parameters, root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr), and WUE were determined. The results showed that the small root variety (XY) has a higher yield and WUE compared to large root variety (QL) under both soil moisture conditions, likely related to the higher Lpr of XY. XY also had a higher leaf water potential than QL under drought stress, indicating that small root system could provide enough water to the shoot. Further pot experiment showed that both small and large root pruning on QL (cut off about 1/5 roots, RP1; and cut off about 1/3 roots, RP2, respectively) improved WUE and Lpr, and the RP1 yield increased by 12.9% compared to the control under well-watered conditions. Root pruning decreased transpiration and increased photosynthesis. Thus, this study reveals that it is possible to increase water absorption, yield, and WUE by reducing R/S in modern maize varieties, which may be important for the future breeding of new cultivars suitable for arid regions.

However, how the forest type affects the stability of the soil food web is not well known. In the Ziwuling forest region of the Loess Plateau, we selected three typical forests, Pinus tabuliformis Carriere (PT), Betula platyphylla Sukaczev (BP), and Quercus liaotungensis Koidz. (QL), to investigate the soil nematode community characteristics in the dry (April) and rainy (August) season, and analyzed their relationships with the soil properties. The results showed that the characteristics of the soil nematode communities and their seasonal variations differed markedly among the forest types. Compared to P. tabuliformis (PT), the B. platyphylla (BP) and Q. liaotungensis (QL) forests had higher plant diversity and more easily decomposed litters, which were more effective for improving the soil resource availability, thus, leading to more beneficial effects on the soil nematode community. In both the dry and rainy season, the soil nematode abundance was the highest in the BP forest. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), Pielou's evenness index (J'), and nematode channel ratio index (NCR) were higher, while the Simpson dominance index (lambda) and plant parasite index (PPI) were lower, in the BP and QL forests compared with in the PT forest. From the dry to rainy season, the total nematode abundance and the abundance of fungivores, bacterivores, and omnivore-predators, significantly increased in the QL and PT forests, and the values of the Wasilewska index (WI), maturity index (MI), H', J', lambda, and NCR showed the most significant seasonal variability in the PT forest, which were mainly driven by changes in the soil labile C and N and the moisture content between the two seasons. Generally, the seasonal stability of the soil nematode communities was the highest in the BP forest and the poorest in the PT forest, probably due to variations in the plant diversity. Our results suggest the importance of tree species and diversity as bottom-up regulating factors of the soil food web structure, function, and seasonal stability, which has important implications for sustainable forest management in the Loess Plateau and other temperate regions.

J	Feng, PY; Wang, B; Liu, DL; Yu, Q				Feng, Puyu; Wang, Bin; Liu, De Li; Yu, Qiang			Machine learning-based integration of remotely-sensed drought factors can improve the estimation of agricultural drought in South-Eastern Australia	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												Agricultural drought is a natural hazard arising from insufficient crop water supply. Many drought indices have been developed to characterize agricultural drought, relying on either ground-based climate data or various remotely-sensed drought proxies. Ground-based drought indices are more accurate but limited in coverage, while remote sensing drought indices cover large areas but have poor precision. Application of advanced data fusion approaches based on remotely-sensed data to estimate ground-based drought indices may help fill this gap. The overall objective of this study was to determine whether various remotely-sensed drought factors could be effectively used for monitoring agricultural drought in south-eastern Australia. In this study, thirty remotely-sensed drought factors from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors were used to reproduce a ground-based drought index, SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) during 2001-2017 for the New South Wales wheat belt in south-eastern Australia. Three advanced machine learning methods, i.e. bias-corrected random forest, support vector machine, and multi-layer perceptron neural network, were adopted as the regression models in this procedure. A station-based historical climate dataset and observed wheat yields were used as reference data to evaluate the performance of the model-predicted SPEI in reflecting agricultural drought. Results show that the bias-corrected random forest model outperformed the other two models for SPEI prediction, as quantified by the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the highest R-2 values (< 0.28 and similar to 0.9, respectively). Drought distribution maps produced by the bias-corrected random forest model were then compared with the station-based drought maps, showing strong visual and statistical agreement. Furthermore, the model-predicted SPEI values were more highly correlated with observed wheat yields than the station-based SPEI. The method used in this study is effective and fast, and based on data that are readily available. It can be easily extended to other cropping areas to produce a rapid overview of drought conditions and to enhance the present capabilities of real-time drought monitoring.

The rapid monitoring of the coverage changes in and spatial patterns of photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) at regional scales can help improve the accuracy of soil erosion evaluations. Three deep learning semantic segmentation models, DeepLabV3+, PSPNet, and U-Net, are often used to extract features from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images; however, their extraction processes are highly dependent on the assignment of massive data labels, which greatly limits their applicability. At the same time, numerous shadows are present in UAV images. It is not clear whether the shaded features can be further classified, nor how much accuracy can be achieved. This study took the Mu Us Desert in northern China as an example with which to explore the feasibility and efficiency of shadow-sensitive PV/NPV classification using the three models. Using the object-oriented classification technique alongside manual correction, 728 labels were produced for deep learning PV/NVP semantic segmentation. ResNet 50 was selected as the backbone network with which to train the sample data. Three models were used in the study; the overall accuracy (OA), the kappa coefficient, and the orthogonal statistic were applied to evaluate their accuracy and efficiency. The results showed that, for six characteristics, the three models achieved OAs of 88.3-91.9% and kappa coefficients of 0.81-0.87. The DeepLabV3+ model was superior, and its accuracy for PV and bare soil (BS) under light conditions exceeded 95%; for the three categories of PV/NPV/BS, it achieved an OA of 94.3% and a kappa coefficient of 0.90, performing slightly better (by similar to 2.6% (OA) and similar to 0.05 (kappa coefficient)) than the other two models. The DeepLabV3+ model and corresponding labels were tested in other sites for the same types of features: it achieved OAs of 93.9-95.9% and kappa coefficients of 0.88-0.92. Compared with traditional machine learning methods, such as random forest, the proposed method not only offers a marked improvement in classification accuracy but also realizes the semiautomatic extraction of PV/NPV areas. The results will be useful for land-use planning and land resource management in the areas.

However, few studies have been conducted to quantify sunflower productivity and water productivity (WP) under semi-arid conditions and projected climate change. Experiments were conducted in 2008, 2010, and 2011 on sunflowers under deficit irrigation to meet a fraction of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) as estimated by FAO-56 in eastern Colorado. The field data was used to calibrate and validate the CSM-CROPGRO-Sunflower model that is incorporated in the Root Zone Water Qualify Model (RZWQM2). The calibrated model was then used to simulate sunflower production under projected climate conditions with four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and four irrigation levels (100%, 60%, 40% ETc and rainfed) in the late 21st century. The results showed that the model was able to adequately simulate sunflower biomass, yield, and soil water storage under the different irrigation treatments in all three years. The corresponding relative root mean square deviation (RRMSD) values were between 0.05 and 0.15 for the simulations of soil water storage, yield, and biomass. Under future climate change conditions, the model simulated greater impact of irrigation treatments than RCP scenarios on sunflower production. For example, yield was 3251.3, 2638.85 and 1937.17 kg ha(-1) with 100%, 60% and 40% ETc irrigation under baseline (1992-2013) and was 2932.47, 2360.53 and 1810.65 kg ha(-1) with these irrigation treatments under RCP8.5 (2070-2091). Simulation results also showed that scheduling irrigations based on 60% of ETc was the best choice for sunflower WP in eastern Colorado. Climate change did not affect sunflower biomass, yield, and WP. There was an increasing trend of irrigation amount was simulated from the baseline to RCP8.5 scenario to maintain a certain percent of ETc due to high temperature projected. For instance, the irrigation amount for 100%, 60% and 40% of ETc irrigation treatment was 16.4%, 17.3%, and 20.0% higher under RCP8.5 than those under baseline conditions with CO2 fertilization. Finally, our results demonstrated that RZWQM2 can be used to effectively schedule sunflower irrigations based on crop evapotranspiration requirement.					zhang, hui/GXH-6098-2022; Zhang, Hw/HPD-4999-2023; Zhang, Hui/HHN-8494-2022; Wang, Li/AAE-6919-2022; ZHANG, hui jie/HTN-1690-2023														0378-3774	1873-2283				MAR 1	2021	246								106672	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106672													WOS:000611820000013

The trials consisted of 10 maize varieties sown at three different sowing densities (2.6, 5.3, and 6.6 plants m(-2)) across farmers' field with contrasting agronomic and nutrient management histories. Model predictions in both years and locations were close to observed data for both calibration and evaluation exercises as evidenced by low normalized root mean square error (RMSE) (<= 15%), high modified d-index (> 0.6), and high model efficiency (>0.45) values for the phenology, growth, and yield data across all varieties and agro-ecologies. In both years and locations and for both calibration and evaluation exercises, very good agreements were found between observed and model-simulated grain yields, number of days to physiological maturity, above-ground biomass, and harvest index. Two separate scenario analyses were conducted using the long-term (26 years) weather records for Bunkure (representing the SS) and Zaria (representing the NGS). The early and extra-early varieties were used in the SS while the intermediate and late varieties were used in the NGS. The result of the scenario analyses showed that early and extra-early varieties grown in the SS responds to increased sowing density up to 8.8 plants m(-2) when the recommended rate of N fertilizers (90 kg N ha(-1)) was applied. In the NGS, yield responses were observed up to a density of 6.6 plants m(-2) with the application of 120 kg N ha(-1) for the intermediate and late varieties. The highest mean monetary returns to land (US$1336.1 ha(-1)) were simulated for scenarios with 8.8 plants m(-2) and 90 kg N ha(-1), while the highest return to labor (US$957.7 ha(-1)) was simulated for scenarios with 6.6 plants m(-2) and 90 Kg N ha(-1) in the SS. In the NGS, monetary return per hectare was highest with a planting density of 6.6 plants m(-2) with the application of 120 kg N, while the return to labor was highest for sowing density of 5.3 plants m(-2) at the same N fertilizer application rates. The results of the long-term simulations predicted increases in yield and economic returns to land and labor by increasing sowing densities in the maize belts of Nigeria without applying N fertilizers above the recommended rates.

Mold infection and mycotoxin production can potentially lead to significant losses of chickpea during storage. Under laboratory conditions we tested comparative effects of hermetic and traditional storage structures on mold infection, germination and mycotoxin levels of chickpea. Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags, Super GrainPro (SGP) bags, and small metal bins were compared to the traditional and popularly used chickpea storage structures such as polypropylene (PP) bags and jute bags over a six-month storage period. Oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, chickpea temperature and moisture, seed infection with molds and percentage germination and mycotoxins levels were determined every two months for six months. In PICS bags, SGP bags and metal bins chickpea temperature and moisture changed very little during storage, whereas in jute and PP bags significant temperature and moisture increases were observed. Oxygen levels in PICS and SGP bags decreased from 20% to 8-10% in six months and carbon dioxide levels increased from 0.4% to 10% in PICS bags and from 0.1% to 17% in SGP bags. In jute and PP bags, oxygen levels were around 20% but carbon dioxide levels increased from 0.05% to 0.1-0.2%, perhaps due to mold activity. Mold infection decreased over time in chickpea stored in PICS bags, SGP bags, and metal bins, and seed germination was high (82-92%). Mold infection increased and seed germination decreased in chickpea stored in jute and PP bags. Increases in levels of aflatoxin, fumonisin, deoxynevalenol, and ochratoxin were observed only for chickpea stored in metal bins, and in jute and PP bags. Our study showed that PICS and SGP bags can effectively arrest mold growth, mycotoxin accumulation and preserve germination of chickpea during six months of storage. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Correlations between ballochorous and myrmecochorous phases of diplochory	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												The combination of two dispersal syndromes (diplochory) brings additional benefits to seeds, yet the relative costs and benefits of the two phases are poorly understood. Our goal is to provide the first quantification to test the long-standing assumption that there are trade-offs between the two phases in ballistic-ant diplochory. Dispersal investment data were empirically measured for 91 Euphorbiaceae species across different regions of the world. Dispersal distance data of ballochory (seed dispersal by explosion), myrmecochory (seed dispersal by ants) and diplochory was collated from the literature for 210 records (148 species from 44 families). The data were analysed using Model II regression, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and t test, complemented by phylogenetic comparative approaches. Across diaspores of diplochorous species, the relative investment in myrmecochory increased more than that in ballochory. Fruit coat mass and elaiosome mass covaried in an allometric manner, regardless of seed mass. Diplochorous diaspores were significantly heavier than diaspores dispersed solely by ballochory. Dispersal distances of the two diplochorous phases were independent and comparable to that of sole ballochory or sole myrmecochory. Our results do not support a trade-off, but a coordinated dispersal strategy between the two diplochorous phases. Large diaspores may evolve diplochory to overcome dispersal difficulties in term of dispersal distance. As the most comprehensive study of ballistic-ant diplochory, our findings advance the understanding of the relative importance of the two phases in diplochory.

However, the transport of aggregate-associated OC has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this issue, 27 simulated rainfall experiments were conducted in a 1 m x 0.35 m box on slope gradients of 15 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees and under three rainfall intensities of 45 mm h(-1), 90 mm h(-1) and 120 mm h(-1). The results showed that OC was obviously enriched in sediment particles of different sizes under sheet erosion. The soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations of each aggregate size class in sediments were different from those in the original soil, especially when the rainfall intensity or slope was sufficiently low, such as 45 mm h(-1) or 5 degrees, respectively. Under a slope of 5 degrees, the SOC enrichment ratios (ERocs) of small macroaggregates and microaggregates were high but decreased over time. As rainfall intensity increased, OC became enriched in increasingly fine sediment particles. Under a rainfall intensity of 45 mm h(-1), the ERocs of the different aggregate size classes were always high throughout the entire erosion process. Under a rainfall intensity of > 45 mm h(-1) and slope of > 5 degrees, the ERocs of the different aggregate size classes were close to 1.0, especially those of clay and silt. Therefore, the high ERocs in sediments resulted from the first transport of effective clay. Among total SOC loss, the proportion of OC loss caused by the transport of microaggregates and silt plus clay-sized particles was greater than 50%. We also found that low stream power and low water depth were two requirements for the high ERocs in aggregates. Stream power was closely related to sediment particle distribution. Flow velocity was significantly and positively related to the percentage of OC-enriched macroaggregates in the sediments (P > 0.01). Our study will provide important information for understanding the fate of SOC and building physical-based SOC transport models. (c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Surface mulching significantly increased the richness and diversity of the soil bacteria, but had no effect on the soil fungal community. Nitrogen fertilization significantly decreased the bacterial richness, but increased the fungal richness. Surface mulching resulted in a greater abundance of Firmicutes and Methylomirabilota than the treatments lacking mulching. The nitrogen fertilization treatments more greatly increased Proteobacteria and decreased Acidobacteriota, Mortierellomycota, and Glomeromycota in comparison to the treatments lacking N fertilization.ConclusionsNetwork analysis showed that plastic mulching and nitrogen fertiliser application increased the complexity of the co-occurrence network by altering the microbial habitat environment (mainly consisting of soil temperature, MBN, DOC, pH and SWC), while straw mulching reduced the complexity of its subsurface network. This study provides a broader microbial basis for surface mulching and N-fertilizing of maize production in the northwest China.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				2023 SEP 12	2023										10.1007/s11104-023-06260-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06260-8		SEP 2023											WOS:001066968400002

While existing studies provide evidence on how climate variability affects the food security and nutrition, research examining the extent of effect vulnerability of agriculture to climate change can have on nutrition in India are scarce. This study examined a) the association between the degree of vulnerability in agriculture to climate change and child nutrition at the micro-level b) spatial effect of climate vulnerability on child nutrition, and c) the geographical hotspots of both vulnerability in agriculture to climate change and child malnutrition. Methods The study used an index on vulnerability of agriculture to climate change and linked it to child malnutrition indicators (stunting, wasting, underweight and anaemia) from the National Family Health Survey 4 (2015-16). Mixed-effect and spatial autoregressive models were fitted to assess the direction and strength of the relationship between vulnerability and child malnutrition at macro and micro level. Spatial analyses examined the within-district and across-district spill-over effects of climate change vulnerability on child malnutrition. Results Both mixed-effect and spatial autoregressive models found that the degree of vulnerability was positively associated with malnutrition among children. Children residing in districts with a very high degree of vulnerability were more like to have malnutrition than those residing in districts with very low vulnerability. The analyses found that the odds of a child suffering from stunting increased by 32%, wasting by 42%, underweight by 45%, and anaemia by 63% if the child belonged to a district categorised as very highly vulnerable when compared to those categorised as very low. The spatial analysis also suggested a high level of clustering in the spatial distribution of vulnerability and malnutrition. Hotspots of child malnutrition and degree of vulnerability were mostly found to be clustered around western-central part of India. Conclusion Study highlights the consequences that vulnerability of agriculture to climate change can have on child nutrition. Strategies should be developed to mitigate the effect of climate change on areas where there is a clustering of vulnerability and child malnutrition.

This information, processed in multiple regions of the brain, ultimately result in the production of stress hormones and visible changes in behaviour of animals - both reflexively to avoid depredation and strategically to avoid an encounter with the predator. In a common-garden experiment we tested how imperfect information from visual cues of a predator impacts foraging and apprehension of a desert rodent, the Egyptian gerbil (Gerbillus pyramidum). The gerbils were exposed to predation by barn owls (Tyto alba), one camouflaged on dark nights using black dye. Gerbils' response to the owls was measured using patch-use measured in giving-up densities (GUDs) and time spent in vigilance activity. Owl lethality was extrapolated from mean times spent in attacks and number of attempted strikes. Dyed owls attack-rate was lower and attack duration greater than those of the white owls. During the full moon, when dyed owls were visible, gerbils responded with extreme vigilance and minimal foraging (high GUDs). During the new moon when the owls were most stealthy, the gerbils showed low vigilance coupled with a similar high GUD. The inconsistency between gerbils' foraging and vigilance behaviours, suggest a likely mismatch between perceived risk and actual measurement of predator lethality gathered by the gerbils' observations in real time.

The main objective of this research was to quantify the lateral sediment connectivity of landslides and explore their relationship to the sediment yield of slope-channel cascades. Combining fieldwork and unmanned aerial vehicle techniques, we mapped all landslide inventories and calculated the amount of soil erosion. We proposed a new lateral sediment connectivity index (LCI), which takes into account landslide area density, landslide connectivity characteristics, and landslide potential transport distance, to explore whether landslides that occurred under heavy rainstorms affect the sediment yield in slope-channel cascades through legacy effects. Results showed that the area of landslides ranged from 0.2 m(2) to 1100.07 m(2), and the soil erosion amount of landslides ranged from 0.21 t to 1690.81 t during the rainstorm that occurred on 4 August. 2020 with a cumulative rainfall of 216.4 mm. The LCI of landslides was more closely related to the sediment yield of slope-channel cascades after the rainstorm. It was indicated that LCI is a good index to quantify the effect of lateral sediment connectivity of landslides on sediment yield in the catchment and that landslides generated by heavy rainstorms have long-term impacts on sediment transport processes in the slope-channel cascades of the catchment. Regarding slope management, we propose to protect gully slopes by reducing lateral sediment connectivity between upslope areas and gully slopes and to protect terrace slopes by constructing boundary dikes and drainage ditches to reduce slope collapse under heavy rainstorms.					zhang, ziqi/GPW-6618-2022; ZHANG, Ziqi/JDM-7543-2023; Zhang, Ziqi/HHN-7875-2022	YAN, Xiqin/0000-0003-1434-7075													0341-8162	1872-6887				SEP	2022	216		A						106378	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106378		MAY 2022											WOS:000829817900005

The impact of tubificid worm with different densities on the vertical water exchange at the sediment-water interface was investigated based on laboratory flume experiments. Vertical water fluxes, as well as physiochemical parameters, were measured at seven-day intervals, and the maximum penetration depths were obtained by dye injection before and after the tubificid bioturbation experiment, respectively. The bioturbation effects can be summarized in two aspects: (1) when the density was less than (or equal to) 20 individual/10 cm(2), the volume of vertical water exchange positively correlated with the tubificid bioturbation. Once the density exceeded (or equaled) 25 individual/10 cm(2), the vertical water flux decreased with increasing tubificid bioturbation. After 14 to 21 days, a negative correlation was identified between the bioturbation and the vertical water flux under all biological densities. (2) The maximum depth that the surface water can penetrate the sediment increased with increasing tubificid density. These results revealed that the vertical water was closely related to the biological density. The study has certain reference significance to understanding the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of hyporheic water exchange on a local scale.

The most of soil erosion were caused by erosive rainstorm events. Yet, the response of surface runoff and soil erosion to erosive rainstorm events and vegetation types has not been fully understood. In this study, we monitored the vegetation, rainfall, runoff and soil erosion on ten runoff plots under field conditions from 2015 to 2019 and examined the impact of erosive rainstorm events on runoff and soil erosion among different vegetation types (Artemisia scoparia -> Stipa bungeana. Lespedeza davurica (Asc -> Sb -> Ld), Stipa bungeana -> Artemisia gmelinii (Sb. Agm), Bothriochloa ischaemum (Bi), Artemisia gmelinii + Stipa bungeana (Agm + Sb), Artemisia gmelinii + Stipa grandis (Agm + Sg), Sophora viciifolia (Sv), Artemisia gmelinii + Artemisia giraldii (Agm + Agi)) and bare land on abandoned land slopes. The results showed that vegetation restoration could decrease 68.0% to 97.4% of runoff and 98.0% to 99.9% of soil erosion compared to the bare land and there were no significant difference of surface runoff and soil loss among different vegetation types under the 11 erosive rainstorm events. The average soil loss of erosive rainstorm events among vegetation types could be 2.1 to 15.6 times as those of ordinary erosive rainfall events. The erosive rainstorm events caused a significant variance of surface runoff and soil erosion because of variant antecedent soil moisture and rainfall intensity. In practice, the natural vegetation restoration should be recommended in semi-arid environment and, the erosive rainstorm events should be paid enough attention in causing intense soil erosion in the rainy reasons.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2020	584								124694	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124694													WOS:000527390200076

Year-round observation is necessary to investigate species-specific characteristics of sap flow and its possible contribution in non-growing season. The middle Loess Plateau in China is characterized by temperate climate and vegetation cover of generally drought-tolerant deciduous broadleaved and some evergreen coniferous trees. In this study, Granier-type thermal dissipation probes were applied to measure year-round xylem sap flow in three species from April 2017 to April 2018. Solar radiation, air temperature, relative air humidity, precipitation, and soil moisture were monitored continuously. The results showed that the peak time of sap flux density (F-d) in the diurnal courses of Robinia pseudoacacia was later than that of Quercus liaotungensis and Platycladus orientalis. The peak time of F-d for R. pseudoacacia was significantly postponed during the period with higher soil moisture when compared with that at lower soil moisture, whereas the peak time was reached slightly earlier in the other two species. Sap flow during the non-growing season was relatively higher in P. orientalis than in the two broadleaved species. The diurnal course of F-d in non-growing season showed high values at nighttime and low values in daytime, opposite to that in growing season. Daily variation in stem diameter was inverse of the change in sap flow in the two broadleaved species, whereas the daily change in stem diameter of P. orientalis was very small and showed no clear relation with sap flow. The results suggest that changes in transpiration characteristics with soil moisture conditions vary with tree species; sap flow in deciduous broadleaved trees in non-growing season is small and closely related to daily changes in stem diameter.

J	Liang, SQ; Peng, SZ; Chen, YM				Liang, Siqi; Peng, Shouzhang; Chen, Yunming			Carbon Cycles of Forest Ecosystems in a Typical Climate Transition Zone under Future Climate Change: A Case Study of Shaanxi Province, China	FORESTS												As global climate change has a large effect on the carbon cycle of forests, it is very important to understand how forests in climate transition regions respond to climate change. Specifically, the LPJ-GUESS (Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator) model was used to simulate net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) dynamics of two forest ecosystems of different origins between 1951 and 2100, to quantitatively analyze the carbon source and sink functions and potential changes in soil carbon dynamics in arid and humid regions under future climate change, simulate the dynamics of forest net primary productivity (NPP) under different climatic factors, and analyze the sensitivity of forests in arid and humid regions to temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. We found that: (1) in both the historical and future periods, the average NEP of both studied forests in the humid region was larger than that in the arid region, the carbon sink function of the humid region being predicted to become stronger and the arid zone possibly becoming a carbon source; (2) between 1951 and 2100, the forest soil Rh in the arid region was lower than that in the humid region and under future climate change, forest in the humid region may have higher soil carbon loss; (3) increasing temperature had a negative effect and CO2 concentration had a positive effect on the forests in the study area, and forests in arid areas are more sensitive to precipitation change. We believe our research could be applied to help policy makers in planning sustainable forest management under future climate change.																				1999-4907				DEC	2019	10	12							1150	10.3390/f10121150	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10121150													WOS:000507288400025

However, road erosion is commonly overlooked because unpaved roads represent a small part of the catchment area. In situ scouring-erosion experiments were performed on LR surfaces in the Liuaogou watershed on the Loess Plateau. The erosion rate of the LR was 14.1-234.6 g m(-2)min(-1), which is 10.8-57.5-times higher than that on an adjacent grassy hillslope. In most experiments, the LR erosion rate generally increased linearly with increasing concentrated flow and slope gradient (R-2 > .85; significancep < .05). Concentrated flow had a greater impact on road erosion than the road surface slope. Rill erosion occurred in our road plots, with rill area densities of 0.03-0.38 m(2)m(-2). The total amount of road erosion was significantly correlated linearly with the rill area density (R-2= .61,p < .01), indicating that high rill density led to high total erosion on the LR. A road erosion equation based on concentrated flow and slope gradient was established and validated. TheR(2),p, and NSE results were .91, <.01 and 0.93, respectively, implying that the fitted equation can be considered acceptable. Our findings can provide references for the prevention of road erosion and the establishment of road erosion models.

In this study, we investigated the potential use of biogas solid residue (BSR) from anaerobic digestion as an effective amendment to decrease the bioavailability of Cr in Cr(VI)-polluted soil using pot experiments. Compared to the no-addition treatment, the addition of BSR (treatments50, 100, and 150gkg(-1) soil) increased the soil nutrient levels, microbial diversity and activities, and decreased the redox potential (Eh). BSR treatment of Cr(VI)-contaminated soil caused a reduction in soil Cr(VI) concentration (16.6-52.1%) and the exchangeable Cr proportion (15.2-52.4%), thereby decreasing the available Cr for uptake by plants. BSR treatments resulted in a reduction in the Cr contents of the roots and aboveground biomass of pakchoi plants. The Cr(VI) content in treated soils decreased with increasing BSR addition, with 150gkg(-1) being the most efficient application. The relative abundance of Cr-reducing groups, such as Pseudomonas, Microbacterium, and Bacillus, increased with the increase in BSR application. The enhancement of soil Cr(VI) immobilization by the addition of the BSR was mostly attributed to the simultaneous effect of organic matter addition, stimulation of microorganisms, and reduced Eh value. Organic matter contributed more to the variation in Cr. The presence of BSR decreased the bioavailability of Cr in the soil and, therefore, lowered the potential mobilization of Cr(VI) from the soils. Our results demonstrated that BSR application may offer a potentially promising solution for enhancing agricultural production in Cr-contaminated soils.

Recent studies suggest that root inputs exert a disproportionate influence on SOC formation, and therefore, it is necessary to test separately the effects during root growth (i.e. rhizode-position) and dead root decomposition (i.e. belowground litter) under natural conditions. A field experiment was carried out in grasslands with three typical plants: Stipa bungeana (St.B), Artemisia sacrorum (Ar.S), and Thymus mongolicus (Th.M) to differentiate the effects of root growth vs decomposition on C inputs by using in-growth soil cores and litter bag methods. For root growth experiment, the SOC content increased (2.5-3.8 g & BULL;kg-1) with root biomass, especially in soil under Ar.S. C input increased mineral-associated organic C (MAOC%) from 57% to 65%. The SOC 813C was consistent with roots 813C, indicating the roots were the primary source of SOC. The root decomposition experiment showed that the increase in SOC (0.74-2.6 g & BULL;kg � 1) was highest at 90 days. Root decomposition rate was fast before 45 days, and SOC increased with the MAOC% during this period. After 45 days, particulate organic C % (POC%) was raised and was higher than in the control soil. The increase in SOC under root growth (2.5-3.8 g & BULL;kg � 1) after one year was greater as compared to the rate under root decomposition (-0.4-0 g & BULL;kg � 1). It suggested that C released during root growth was more effectively retained in the soil than that caused by dead root decomposition. The rise in MAOC during root growth and decomposition mainly explains the increase in SOC. Our results provided direct field based evidence illustrating the specific contribution of root growth and decomposition to SOC.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				OCT	2023	231								107317	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107317		JUN 2023											WOS:001040571400001

To explore environment-friendly and efficient farming systems is a central aspect of rainfed wheat field management in Kenya where rainfall utilization is at a low level. We introduced RFMs (including plastic film and grass straw mulching) to semiarid Kenya to evaluate the effects on field productivity, rainwater utilization, soil quality and economic profitability using old and modern wheat cultivars from 2012 to 2013. RESULTS Across the cultivars, the RFMs increased grain yield, aboveground biomass and water use efficiency by 74-163%, 36-104% and 89-273%, respectively, compared with conventional flat planting (control). RFMs significantly shortened the vegetative period while prolonging the reproductive period. The net economic output under RFMs was 74-165% higher than that of the control. Grass straw mulching achieved the highest economic output to input ratio, almost 45% higher than plastic film mulching, despite the former harvested only 82% of the maximum field productivity of the latter. Compared with the control, grass straw mulching promoted the contents of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and C:N ratio by 14%, 8% and 5%, respectively, while obviously decreased values of these parameters were observed under plastic mulching. CONCLUSIONS Through reducing soil water loss, and improving rainwater use efficiency and soil quality, ridge-furrow grass straw mulching would be a sustainable option for boosting field productivity and thus ensuring local food security in rainfed agricultural areas of Kenya.					mo, fei/B-5253-2018; wang, qiang/IZW-1751-2023; Xiong, You-Cai/HDL-8596-2022; Mo, Fei/R-5645-2017	Xiong, You-Cai/0000-0002-4394-8331; Wang, Jianyong/0000-0002-9863-0056; Mo, Fei/0000-0002-7538-0453													0022-5142	1097-0010				MAY	2021	101	7					3030	3040		10.1002/jsfa.10937	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.10937		DEC 2020						33179763					WOS:000595462100001

Genetic imprints of domestication for disease resistance, oil quality, and yield component traits in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.)	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS												Ploidy difference between wild Arachis species and cultivated genotypes hinder transfer of useful alleles for agronomically important traits. To overcome this genetic barrier, two synthetic tetraploids, viz., ISATGR 1212 (A. duranensis ICG 8123xA. ipaensis ICG 8206) and ISATGR 265-5A (A. kempff-mercadoi ICG 8164xA. hoehnei ICG 8190), were used to generate two advanced backcross (AB) populations. The AB-populations, namely, AB-pop1 (ICGV 91114xISATGR 1212) and AB-pop2, (ICGV 87846xISATGR 265-5A) were genotyped with DArT and SSR markers. Genetic maps were constructed for AB-pop1 and AB-pop2 populations with 258 loci (1415.7cM map length and map density of 5.5 cM/loci) and 1043 loci (1500.8cM map length with map density of 1.4cM/loci), respectively. Genetic analysis identified large number of wild segments in the population and provided a good source of diversity in these populations. Phenotyping of these two populations identified several introgression lines with good agronomic, oil quality, and disease resistance traits. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis showed that the wild genomic segments contributed favourable alleles for foliar disease resistance while cultivated genomic segments mostly contributed favourable alleles for oil quality and yield component traits.

RESULTSBased on the eddy covariance (EC) technique and soil respiration observations during the 2017 and 2019 summer maize growing seasons, this study analyzed the carbon balance and revealed the factors controlling carbon fluxes in the summer maize agroecosystem. Green leaf area index was the most important factor affecting net ecosystem exchange (NEE), total primary productivity, and total ecosystem respiration (TER) in the rapid development stage during the growing season, followed by soil water content. However, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, saturated vapor pressure difference, and photosynthetically active radiation were the main factors that influenced carbon balance at the middle stage. The cumulative TER in 2019 was 40% (320.9 g C m(-2)) higher than that in 2017. The NEE estimates of summer maize agroecosystems in 2017 and 2019 were -71.7 and 160.4 g C m(-2), respectively. Accounting for the carbon input at sowing (10 g C m(-2)) and the similar carbon output at harvest owing to grain removal, the net biome productivity in 2019 was 1.75 times that in 2017, at -636 and -363 g C m(-2), respectively. CONCLUSIONThe carbon balance of the summer maize agroecosystem in the Guanzhong Plain was determined to be a net carbon source that could export carbon at an average rate of 499.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1).

Freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) is a natural phenomenon, which can alter soil properties, causing widespread concern. However, few studies have focused on the effects of FTCs on hydraulic conductivity in BCs, which may alter the negative effects of BCs on hydraulic conductivity. We conducted an in-situ FTCs simulated experiment in BCs and bare sand (BS), to analyze the response of particle-size composition, water-stable aggregates and water repellency (WR) to FTCs, and their effects on saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s). The results showed that the existence of BCs had affected water-stable aggregates, particle-size composition, WR and K-s. Compared with BS, the percentage of clay-size particle content increased by 44% and 60% in BCs layer and its underlying soil, respectively. The stability of water-stable aggregates was 19% higher in BCs than the measured stability in BS. K-s of BS was 2.4 times higher than that of BCs, and the increasing percentage of water-stable aggregates larger than 5 mm would reduce K-s in sandy land. FTCs had the significant effects on water-stable aggregates, WR and K-s. WR and K-s of BCs were decreased 57% and 25% after FTCs, respectively. Moreover, after FTCs, the percentage of soil water-stable aggregates > 5 mm reduced 19%, while 1-5 mm increased 18%. WR and sand content were significantly and negatively correlated with K-s, while clay content and the percentage of soil water-stable aggregates > 5 mm were significantly and positively correlated with K-s in BCs. Our results indicated that BCs and FTCs had a significant and negative effects on K-s. FTCs further decreased the hydraulic conductivity, which was not conductive to the supply of meltwater to soil water reservoir in the period of winter and early spring.

Generally the model parameter is assumed to reflect factors besides DI, especially the underlying surface features. However, recent studies have revealed its relations with DI, which forces us to further examine its connotation. We revisited the derivation of three parametric Budyko equations and found that model parameter was essentially a lumped variable representing the integrative effects of climate and underlying surface system. Then taking 15 typical catchments in the Chinese Loess Plateau as the study area, we explored the controls of Budyko-Fu model parameter (w) and their differences in temporal (between-years) and spatial (between-catchments) processes. As expected, w was affected by both climate and underlying surface factors. Specifically, DI, climate seasonality and asynchrony index (SAI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) influenced w in both temporal and spatial processes; besides, catchment relief ratio (CR) and relative infiltration capacity (ks/ir) also affected w in spatial process. SAI was strongly correlated with DI and its close relationship with w essentially conveyed DI's influence. Considering the inherent connection between DI and the inverse w, DI was not included in the empirical formula for w. SAI and NDVI remained independent in temporal process and the empirical formula for w with these two factors modeled annual ET well (MAE = 15.03 mm). In spatial process, SAI, NDVI, CR, and ks/ir were interconnected and by using any one the spatial variation of ET was captured adequately (MAE = 11.16, 11.74, 11.27, and 10.43 mm, respectively). Our results demonstrate theoretically and empirically the importance of viewing Budyko model parameter from earth system science perspective and focusing on the differences of its controls in spatiotemporal processes.

AND BUSH CLOVER (<i>LESPEDEZA DAVURICA</i> S.) IN MIXED PLANTATION UNDER VARYING SOIL WATER AND PHOSPHORUS SUPPLY CONDITIONS	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Water and phosphorus (P) are two major factors affecting plant growth on the Loess Plateau of China. To clarify root response of introduced species to native species in mixture under varying water and P supplies would be favorable for assessing their interactions. This study investigated the effects of soil water, P and mixture ratio on root growth and morphology of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) (an introduced C-4 perennial herbaceous grass) and bushclover (Lespedeza davurica S.) (a C-3 perennial leguminous subshrub) in mixtures in a pot experiment. Two soil water regimes [75 +/- 5% field capacity, FC (high water, HW) and 35 +/- 5% FC (low water, LW)], three P treatments (addition of 0, 0.05 and 0.1 g of P2O5 per kg dry soil) and 5 mixture ratios of the two species (12:0, 8:4, 6:6, 4:8, 0:12) were complemented. Results showed that switchgrass tended to decrease root average diameter (RAD) and increase specific root length (SRL) under LW comparing with HW, while bushclover showed the opposite trends. P application significantly (p<0.05) deceased the RAD of switchgrass under LW, while had no effect on SRL, resulting in a thinner root system with higher root tissue density. Regardless of soil water regimes, SRL of bushclover decreased significantly after P application. Root biomass and total root length of switchgrass were increased with the decrease of mixture ratio, while both parameters decreased in bushclover. In mixture with switchgrass, bushclover decreased SRL and proportion of fine root length (0-0.5 mm diameter class). The present study implied that switchgrass would be superior when mixed with bushclover, and P application might increase the abilities of switchgrass in competing and acquiring for limited resources.

Accurate and consistent field spectral measurements are required to develop and validate spectral indices for FVC estimation. However, there are rarely any experimental studies to determine the appropriate times for field spectral measurements, and the existing guidelines or references are rather general or inconsistent, it is still not agreed upon and detailed experiments are missing for a local research. In this experiment, five groundcover objects were measured continuously from 07:30 a.m. to 17:30 p.m. local time in three consecutive sunny days using a portable spectrometer. The coefficients of variation (CV) were applied to investigate the reflectance variation at wavelengths corresponding to MODIS satellite channels and the derived spectral indices used to estimate FVC, including photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV). The results reveal little variation in the reflectance measured between 10:00 a.m. and 16:00 p.m., with CV values generally less than 10%. The CV values of FVC spectral indices for estimating PV, NPV and bare soil (BS) are generally less than 3%. While more experiments are yet to be carried out at different locations and in different seasons, the findings so far imply that the in situ spectrum measured between 9:00 a.m. and 17:00 p.m. local time would be useful to discriminate FVC objects and validate satellite estimates-based indices using visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared channels.					yang, xihua/AAD-9855-2022; zheng, xin/JNS-5523-2023; Zhang, Lanyue/JNS-8209-2023; He, Jie/AAN-2665-2021	He, Jie/0000-0002-5763-4624; Yang, Xihua/0000-0002-5990-2186; Zhang, Xiaoping/0000-0002-6239-1006; Lyu, Du/0000-0002-2102-0356														2072-4292				SEP	2020	12	18							2942	10.3390/rs12182942	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12182942													WOS:000580744500001
J	Tao, WH; Wang, QJ; Guo, L; Lin, HR				Tao, Wanghai; Wang, Quanjiu; Guo, Li; Lin, Henry			A new analytical model for predicting soil erosion and nutrient loss during crop growth on the Chinese loess plateau	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Soil erosion and nutrient loss cause serious land degradation and environmental problems worldwide. A quantitative understanding of rainfall-induced sediment and nutrient transport is needed to mitigate these harmful effects. Here, we present a new analytical model of nutrient loss on sloping land during crop growth on the Chinese Loess Plateau, where human activities have intensified soil erosion and nutrient loss. The model's parameterization is based on crop conditions (crop height, crop coverage, above-ground biomass, and root weight density) and soil characteristics (soil bulk density and organic carbon content). To evaluate the model's performance, simulated rainfall experiments were conducted in the field during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons with three crops (wheat, soybean, and millet). Path analysis indicated that crop coverage was the factor with the strongest effect on the runoff coefficient, sediment load, and nutrient loss. Crop coverage was also the factor with the greatest contribution to five model parameters, namely the topography and surface roughness coefficients, the calibration constants for runoff and splash erosion, and the exchange layer depth. The model's parameters were determined by least-squares fitting to the measured unit discharge, sediment load, and nutrient concentration measurements from 2016. These parameters showed decreasing trends over the growing season due to the dynamics of crop coverage. Empirical expressions for generating parameter values suitable for use with the model were established based on the 2016 crop conditions and soil properties. Independent data from 2017 were then used to assess the new model's accuracy. The predicted results agreed quite well with field observations (R-2 > 0.73, RMSE < 0.07), indicating that the new model is an effective analytical tool for predicting plot-scale soil erosion and nutrient loss in sloping farmland on the Chinese Loess Plateau, and should be applicable to similar sites with proper parameterization. This model facilitates quantitative analysis of land development and degradation processes, and provides a theoretical framework for further use of watershed forecasting models in efforts to mitigate soil erosion and nutrient loss.

The aim of this study was to figure out the effect of melatonin on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis and heavy metal tolerance. A three-factor experiment was conducted to determine the effect of melatonin application on the growth, AM symbiosis, and stress tolerance of Medicago truncatula. A two-factor (AM inoculation and Pb stress) experiment was conducted to determine the effect of AM fungus on melatonin accumulation under Pb stress. AM plants under Pb stress had a higher melatonin accumulation than non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants under Pb stress. Acetylserotonin methyltransferase (ASMT) is the enzymatic reaction of the last step in melatonin synthesis. The accumulation of melatonin may be related to the expression of MtASMT. Melatonin application increased the relative expression of MtPT4 and AM colonization in AM plants. Melatonin application decreased Pb uptake with and without AM inoculation. Both melatonin application and AM inoculation improved M. truncatula growth and increased antioxidant response with Pb stress. These results indicated that melatonin application has positive effects on AM symbiosis and Pb stress tolerance under Pb stress. AM inoculation improve melatonin synthesis capacity under Pb stress. Melatonin application may improve AM plant growth by enhancing AM symbiosis, stimulating antioxidant response, and inhibiting Pb uptake.

Cu/SiC was synthesized by employing an impregnation method and the effects of parameters such as reaction time, catalyst dosage, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) dosage, microwave power and pH on the rate of degradation of MO were also studied. The obtained results showed that almost complete degradation was obtained in the presence of Cu/SiC catalyst within 8 min of irradiation when 100 mL of MO solution (20 mg/L), 3 ml/L of H2O2, 2 g/L of catalyst dose, 600 W of MW power, and pH 7 were applied. The Cu-bearing catalyst with H2O2 formed a Fenton-like system and the rate of generation of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) was also accelerated by subjecting to MW. From the kinetic analysis, it is revealed that the degradation of MO using the MW-Cu/SiC-H2O2 system follows the pseudo-first-order.

However, it remains unexplored that whether its role is affected by anthropogenic disturbances, and whether the effects of different disturbances are consistent. Here, we report a novel and general pattern that different disturbances consistently restrain the role of migration in soil bacterial community assembly. We mimicked 16 types of anthropogenic disturbances relevant to a Eurasian steppe ecosystem, including removing different number of plant functional groups, mowing, adding nitrogen, adding phosphorus, watering, warming, and some of their combinations. The estimated migration rates in soil bacterial community assembly with Stephen Hubbell?s neutral model decreased by 0.19 e6.29% under these disturbances. The relative change in migration rate was correlated with the deterministic change in community composition and the relative change in soil pH. Our results suggested that the intensifying anthropogenic disturbances may restrain the random dispersal, colonization and distribution of soil microorganisms. ? 2021 The Author(s).

CGIAR modeling approaches for resource-constrained scenarios: II. Models for analyzing socioeconomic factors to improve policy recommendations	CROP SCIENCE												International crop-related research as conducted by the CGIAR uses crop modeling for a variety of purposes. By linking crop models with economic models and approaches, crop model outputs can be effectively used as inputs into socioeconomic modeling efforts for priority setting and policy advice using ex-ante impact assessment of technologies and scenario analysis. This requires interdisciplinary collaboration and very often collaboration across a variety of research organizations. This study highlights the key topics, purposes, and approaches of socioeconomic analysis within the CGIAR related to cropping systems. Although each CGIAR center has a different mission, all CGIAR centers share a common strategy of striving toward a world free of hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation. This means research is mostly focused toward resource-constrained smallholder farmers. The review covers global modeling efforts using the IMPACT model to farm household bio-economic models for assessing the potential impact of new technologies on farming systems and livelihoods. Although the CGIAR addresses all aspects of food systems, the focus of this review is on crop commodities and the economic analysis linked to crop-growth model results. This study, while not a comprehensive review, provides insights into the richness of the socioeconomic modeling endeavors within the CGIAR. The study highlights the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address the challenges this type of modeling faces.

The results revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic created a double burden on farmers by disrupting farm production on one side and decreased diet diversity on the other. Disruption in farm productions resulted in a decline in household income and increased consumer food prices. The effect on farmers snowballed to other actors in the value chain, and all the actors were affected variably. Availability of storage infrastructure would have saved the farmer's household income to some extent during the pandemic. Supply of diverse nutrient foods through the existing public distribution system, which mostly provides wheat and rice, might have helped tackle the diet diversity issue amongst farmers. Farmer's collectives were perceived to reduce the negative impact during natural disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic by helping to organise smallholder farmers, minimise transaction costs and increase their bargaining power. In addition, effective farm extension services, including market information, could have benefited farmers during the crisis.

Although sparse by Earth standards, a source-to-sink portrayal of the sedimentary system that differs substantially from previous work has been extracted by integrating sedimentology, stratigraphy, mineral and elemental analyses, geochemical modelling, laboratory experiments and Earth analogues in a sequence-stratigraphic and palaeogeographical framework. Approximately 3.5 Ga, these 15 m thick strata contain five facies that range from fine to coarse detrital mudstone with abundant sediment-incorporative evaporite pseudomorphs. The section is dominated by first-cycle grains of minimally weathered primary igneous minerals but with four distinct compositions. Bedding in the mudstones comprises planar-parallel beds, current ripples and wave-induced structures, with common and widespread truncation. The absence of primary desiccation and synaeresis cracks is probably due to minimal clay-mineral content, as supported by laboratory experiments. Evaporite minerals formed on and within detrital muds shortly after accumulation by evapoconcentration and cooling. The succession contains 16 parasequences in five depositional sequences with all the sequence-stratigraphic elements known from terrestrial strata. Two of the sequence boundaries are unconformities that record significant shifts in the behaviour and palaeogeographical configuration of the fluvio-lacustrine system. This contrasts with the previous view that all facies are genetically related. Most of the variability in rock composition can be attributed to stratigraphic changes in provenance that integrate changing drainage basin configurations, type of exposed bedrock and changes in weathering regime. These strata are interpreted as evaporative lake deposits that accumulated in an underfilled lake basin with closed surface hydrography but through-flowing groundwater. Lake waters were saline to hypersaline, and lake levels, shorelines and salinities fluctuated greatly at various temporal scales.

We used the maximum correlation (r(max-cml) ) between phenology and cumulative SPEI (1- to 12-month) to determine the cumulative effect. The maximum correlation (r(max-lag) ) between phenology and lagged SPEI (1-month) was utilized to analyze the time-lag effect. Overall, the cumulative effect affected 25.36% of the vegetated area at the start of the growing season (SOS), 26.43% of the end of the growing season (EOS), and 26.57% of the length of the growing season (LOS). SOS was negatively affected by long-term SPEI, whereas EOS and LOS had positive correlations with short-term SPEI. The r(max-cml) for shrubland was the largest, and the SOS and LOS response time scales of the forest were the shortest. The r(max-cml) was larger in arid and semi-arid (AR and SAR) than in humid and semi-humid (HU and SHU). Meanwhile, the response time scales were longer in HU and SHU than in AR and SAR. The time-lag effect had a larger area of impact on land surface phenology than the cumulative effect, the areas were 46.12%, 47.93%, and 50.45% for SOS, EOS, and LOS, respectively, and the lagged time scales were longer. The phenology-SPEI correlation was dominantly driven by hydrological conditions, and the time scales were mainly affected by thermal factors. Moreover, the onset of phenology and the growth/senescence rate of plants influenced the relationship, suggesting that hydrothermal conditions may shift the time of phenology by regulating the growth/senescence rate and may thus modulate the phenology-drought interaction.

Productivity and quality of fodder as influenced by different bajra napier hybrid and legume fodder cropping systems	RANGE MANAGEMENT AND AGROFORESTRY												The adoption of perennial cereal-legume cropping systems will play an important role in achieving higher fodder productivity and provides a way to bridge the gap between supply and demand of fodder in the country. In this context, a field experiment was conducted to identify the suitable BN hybrid + legume intercropping systems in randomized complete block design with three replications. The results revealed that BN hybrid + lucerne (2:8) system recorded significantly higher green fodder (161.4 t/ha/year) and dry matter (31.7 t/ha/year) yields and also yield of fodder quality attributes. However, crude protein (22.20%), ash (11.12%) and ether extractable fat (3.75%) were higher with sesbania grown as a sole crop. The higher non-fibre carbohydrates (34.20%) and total carbohydrates (76.86%) were noticed with sole cropped BN hybrid. The BN hybrid intercropped with legumes performed better interms of quality forage yield and proved as viable systems than sole cropping systems.																			0971-2070					JUN	2022	43	1					88	93																WOS:000863976800012

Herein, the influence of free radicals within biochar on soil bacteria was investigated from the perspectives of enzyme activity, community structure, and ecoenzymatic stoichiometry. Biochar addition enhanced the contents of EPFRs and derived hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) in the soil, while it reduced bacterial alpha diversity by 5.06-35.44%. The results of redundancy analysis and inhibition experiments collectively demonstrated the key role of EPFRs and (OH)-O-center dot in reducing the bacterial alpha diversity. Specifically, EPFRs and (OH)-O-center dot increased the stoichiometric imbalance by promoting the release of dissolved organic carbon and ammonium N, thus aggravating the P limitation in soil. This was further confirmed by increased alkaline phosphatase activity from 702 to 874 nmol g(-1) h(-1). The P limitation induced by EPFRs and (OH)-O-center dot decreased the bacterial alpha diversity, as evidenced by the negative correlation between P limitation and bacterial alpha diversity (r(2) = -0.931 to -0.979, P < 0.01) and the structural equation model. The obtained results demonstrate a ubiquitous but previously overlooked mechanism for bacterial toxicity of biochar-associated free radicals, providing scientific guidance for safe utilization of biochar.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 17	2023	57	48					20238	20248		10.1021/acs.est.3c06864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c06864								37976412					WOS:001116882000001

Until now, the ecosystem stability against climate changes in regional scale sandy lands remain unclear. In this study, the AutoRegression (ARx) model was combined with time-series Net Primary Productivity (NPP) data to extract stability metrics (e.g., temporal stability, resilience, drought-resistance, and temperature-resistance) to evaluate the stability of the main sandy land regions of Northern China. Strong correlations among ecosystem stability metrics were found in the study area, such as the significant negative correlation between resilience and resistance (r =-0.49, p < 0.01), the strong positive correlation between drought-resistance and temperature-resistance, (r = 0.81, p < 0.01), except for the uncorrelation between resilience and temporal stability. Meanwhile, more unstable regions were found in the western low-or moderate -cover sandy grassland. Due to the differences of factors (e.g. hydrothermal conditions, vegetation species composition, and other disturbances or anthropogenic impacts), the unstable grasslands and barren regions, Otindag and Hulun Buir sandy lands, and slightly desertified area (SL) presented more resilience but less resistance and variance than the forest and cropland, Horqin Sandy Land, and Moderate (M) or Severe desertified areas (S), respectively. Thus, the unstable low-or moderate-cover grassland and SL area should be paid much more attention to meet the challenges of more intense climate extremes in the future.

Knowledge of WUE dynamics and its responses to complex climate controls are prerequisites for addressing the challenges of future climate change and human disturbance of wild lands. Owing to a lack of experimental observations and the complexity of quantifying the individual and interactive effects of different environmental factors, the mechanism of WUE dynamics and the spatiotemporal characteristics of WUE in Central Asian ecosystems remain unclear. Here, a specific Arid Ecosystem Model was used to assess WUE dynamics under environmental stresses, specifically isolating and identifying proprietary features from complex coupling effects, across different ecosystems in Central Asia from 1980 to 2014. WUE declined in southern Xinjiang but exhibited an upward trend in the Tianshan Mountains and northern Kazakhstan. Precipitation and CO(2)controlled WUE of 39% and 54% of Central Asia, respectively. The factor analysis showed that the negative effects of climate change were largely compensated by the CO(2)fertilization effect, and their interaction produced negative feedback to WUE. This resulted in inhibition of the CO(2)fertilization effect during long droughts. The negative effects of warming included increased water stress and enhanced evapotranspiration from vegetation. Based on variations in precipitation and net primary production, we determined that southern Xinjiang and the Turgay Plateau were environmentally vulnerable areas. Our study provides guidance regarding how ecologically fragile regions in Central Asia might cope with environmental pressures under extreme climate change in the future.

Genome-Wide Assessment of Population Structure and Genetic Diversity of the Global Finger Millet Germplasm Panel Conserved at the ICRISAT Genebank	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Finger millet [Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn.] is an important climate-resilient nutrient-dense crop grown as a staple food grain in Asia and Africa. Utilizing the full potential of the crop mainly depends on an in-depth exploration of the vast diversity in its germplasm. In this study, the global finger millet germplasm diversity panel of 314 accessions was genotyped, using the DArTseq approach to assess genetic diversity and population structure. We obtained 33,884 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers on 306 accessions after filtering. Finger millet germplasm showed considerable genetic diversity, and the mean polymorphic information content, gene diversity, and Shannon Index were 0.110, 0.114, and 0.194, respectively. The average genetic distance of the entire set was 0.301 (range 0.040 - 0.450). The accessions of the race elongata (0.326) showed the highest average genetic distance, and the least was in the race plana (0.275); and higher genetic divergence was observed between elongata and vulgaris (0.320), while the least was between compacta and plana (0.281). An average, landrace accessions had higher gene diversity (0.144) and genetic distance (0.299) than the breeding lines (0.117 and 0.267, respectively). A similar average gene diversity was observed in the accessions of Asia (0.132) and Africa (0.129), but Asia had slightly higher genetic distance (0.286) than African accessions (0.276), and the distance between these two regions was 0.327. This was also confirmed by a model-based STRUCTURE analysis, genetic distance-based clustering, and principal coordinate analysis, which revealed two major populations representing Asia and Africa. Analysis of molecular variance suggests that the significant population differentiation was mainly due to within individuals between regions or between populations while races had a negligible impact on population structure. Finger millet diversity is structured based on a geographical region of origin, while the racial structure made negligible contribution to population structure. The information generated from this study can provide greater insights into the population structure and genetic diversity within and among regions and races, and an understanding of genomic-assisted finger millet improvement.

However, green manure crops intercropping could cause water and nutrient competition, but the effects of different green manure crops intercropping on soil water and nutrient status are rarely evaluated. Thus, we conducted a field experiment to investigate the responses of soil moisture, nitrogen, and yield to green manure crops intercropping. Three intercropping patterns, apple-ryegrass (AR), apple-spring rape (AS), and apple-alfalfa (AA), were set up with a blank control (CK), which employed clean tillage in the inter-row and row. All treatments had no significant difference on evapotranspiration. At maturity, AR, AS, and AA treatments reduced soil organic matter content by 4.2%, 6.5%, and 18.8%, and total nitrogen content by 0.01%, 1.3%, and 20.3%, relative to CK, respectively. The water competition degree in AR, AS, and AA were 38.4%, 48.8%, and 64.6%, respectively. Ryegrass, spring rape, and alfalfa's nitrogen use efficiency were 19.71%, 29.24%, and 39.42%, respectively. AR and AS treatments increased the apple yield by 11.7% and 5.7%, and water-use efficiency (WUE) by 14.4% and 7.5%, relative to CK, respectively. AA treatment reduced the apple yield by 6.9% and WUE by 6.8%, relative to CK. All treatments had no significant difference on apple quality. Therefore, in normal water years, we suggest adapting the ryegrass-apple tree intercropping pattern for apple production on the Plateau Loess, China.					张, 体彬/GXH-1048-2022; Li, Wen/JQI-4757-2023	张, 体彬/0000-0002-8617-9149; 														2073-4395				AUG	2023	13	8							2009	10.3390/agronomy13082009	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13082009													WOS:001056590300001

RELATED TO CROP INTRODUCTION IN MARGINALIZED ENVIRONMENTS	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Abiotic stress tolerance and the superior nutritional seed value make Chenopodium quinoa (Amaranthaceae) one of the most important candidates for crop diversification and food use. This article evaluates seed germination behavior, grain yield, pericarp, and seed coat structure of different seed heteromorphs in various quinoa lines, newly introduced on alkaline soils in Caspian lowlands. Introduction into harsh environments induces changes in expression, resulting in increased fruit and seed heterogeneity, expressed as variation in sizes and colors (light and dark), seed coat, and pericarp structure. These changes affect the seed germination, grain yield and other agronomic parameters. Light seeds predominanted, while the proportion of dark seeds varied from 9 to 17 percent in the quinoa lines examined. Tannins, lignin, and stalactites were detected in the cell walls of the exotesta of phenotypes of quinoa seeds. Early-maturing lines had a lower percentage of dark seeds, high germination rates in the laboratory, and synchronized seedling emergence in the field, followed by fast plant growth, high grain yield, and 1000-kernel weight. Caspian drylands are potential areas for the cultivation of early maturing quinoa genotypes, whose seed structural and functional features are not affected by stress conditions. Seed heteromorphism might represent an expectant seed survival strategy under changing environments.																			0556-3321	2070-3368				AUG	2023	55	4					1459	1475		10.30848/PJB2023-4(37)	http://dx.doi.org/10.30848/PJB2023-4(37)													WOS:000972097200027

In order to improve the path-tracking control accuracy and driving stability of orchard traction spraying robots, this study proposed a navigation path-tracking control algorithm based on Double Deep Q-Network (Double DQN). Drawing on the driver's driving experience and referring to the principle of radar scanning and the principle of image recognition, a virtual radar model was constructed to generate a virtual radar map. The virtual radar map was used to describe the position relationship between the traction spraying robot and the planned path. Combined with the deep reinforcement learning method, all possible robot driving actions under the current virtual radar map were scored, and the best driving action was selected as the output of the network. In this study, a path-tracking algorithm was self-developed with a deep Q-network trained by driving the traction spraying robot in a simulated virtual environment. The algorithm was tested in both simulations and in a field to follow a typical 'U'-shaped path. The simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm was able to achieve accurate path-tracking control of the spraying trailer. The field tests showed that when the vehicle speed was 0.36 m/s and 0.75 m/s, the maximum lateral deviation of the algorithm was 0.233 m and 0.266 m, the average lateral deviation was 0.071 m and 0.076 m, and the standard deviation was 0.051 m and 0.057 m, respectively. Compared with the algorithm based on the virtual radar model, the maximum lateral deviation was reduced by 56.37% and 51.54%, the average lateral deviation was reduced by 7.8% and 5.0%, and the standard deviation was reduced by 20.31% and 8.1%, respectively. The results showed that the Double-DQN-based navigation path-tracking control algorithm for the traction spraying robot in the orchard had higher path-tracking accuracy and driving stability, which could meet the actual operational requirements of traditional orchards.						liu, heng/0000-0002-2222-7105														2073-4395				NOV	2022	12	11							2803	10.3390/agronomy12112803	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12112803													WOS:000883397200001

However, whether and how the responses of multiple grassland ecosystem functions to precipitation across spatial scales are controlled by the differential responses of the dominant plant functional types (PFT) remains unclear, mainly due to the scarcity of regional observational data. Here, we examined grassland ecosystem functions (aboveground plant biomass, belowground plant biomass, soil organic carbon, and total nitrogen) with different dominant plant functional types across 100 sites of four precipitation gradients in the Northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau by the moisture index. Across the broad precipitation gradient, higher mean annual precipitation significantly increased the plant species diversity and grassland ecosystem functions (aboveground plant biomass, soil organic C, and total N). From arid zone to humid zone, the above- and below-ground plant biomass allocation shifted to aboveground, and the trade-off between above- and below-ground plant biomass was the largest in semi-humid zone (0.13). Moreover, above- and below-ground plant biomass in arid, semi-arid, and semi-humid zones were driven by the grassdominated communities (52%similar to 91%), while the humid zone was driven by the sedge- and forb- dominated communities (36%similar to 46%). The results of structural equational models further showed that the effects of precipitation on the ecosystem functions (soil organic carbon and total nitrogen) were mediated by either aboveground plant biomass (mainly in sedge-dominated communities) or species diversity (forb- and grass-dominated communities). These findings reveal that the asynchrony responses of different PFT-dominated communities to precipitation are altering grassland ecosystem functions, which provides the novel insight that plant functional group is particularly important for predicting ecosystem functioning under future climate conditions.

This study aims to analyze the spatiotemporal differences in climate impacts qualitatively and quantitatively by applying trend, correlation, and multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses to the data of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and two climatic factors (air temperature and precipitation) during 1982-2015 in China. The MLR equation linking two climatic variables with NDVI was used to identify the NDVI trend caused by climate change. We demonstrated that the central and eastern regions of China, dominated by deciduous and evergreen broadleaf forests, experienced a rapid increase in NDVI from 1982 to 2015. The response of NDVI to variations in temperature and precipitation exhibited large spatiotemporal differences across China, which was closely related to climatic conditions and vegetation types. Overall, warming, particularly the sharp rise in spring, was the main climatic driving force behind China's NDVI increase, and precipitation also influenced the NDVI increase in temperate grassland and desert regions due to the relatively arid climate, particularly in summer. The contributions of climate change to the total NDVI trend (CC) showed a large spatiotemporal heterogeneity across China. Overall, only 45% of the pixels (with a resolution of 8 km) in the study area showed that the MLR equations between NDVI and two climatic factors were significant at the 0.05 significance level during the growing season (April-October), and the average CC of these pixels was 38%. Among the eight vegetation sub-regions of China, the temperate desert and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau alpine meadow regions generally exhibited relatively larger CCs than other vegetation sub-regions in different seasons. At a national scale, the regional average CC reached 64% during the growing season. These results at multiple scales can help to deeply understand the mechanisms of regional environmental variation and sustainability.

However, the effects of fertilization on greenhouse gases fluxes remain unclear in tea soil when soil nitrogen is low. In the present study, soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes under various fertilization treatments in tea soil were investigated during a 50-day period. The experiment consisted of five treatments: no fertilizer (CK), single nitrogen (urea, N), single oilseed rape cake fertilizer (R), nitrogen + cake fertilizer (2:1, NR1), and nitrogen + cake fertilizer (1:2, NR2). The fertilization proportion of NR1 and NR2 was determined by the nitrogen content of nitrogen fertilizer and cake fertilizer. The results revealed that the single application of nitrogen had no significant effect on soil CO2 flux. However, the addition of cake fertilizer significantly increased CO2 emissions through enhanced soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC). Additionally, CO2 emissions were directly proportional to the amount of carbon (C) in the fertilizer. All treatments were minor sinks for CH4 except for the treatment NR1. Specifically, the cumulative CH4 fluxes of NR1 and NR2 were significantly higher than rest of the three treatments, which implies that application of urea and oilseed rape cake reduced the capability of CH4 oxidation in tea soil. Structural equation models indicated that soil CO2 flux is significantly and positively correlated with soil dissolved organic carbon, MBC and soil pH, while mineral nitrogen content was the main factor affecting CH4 flux. Overall, the application of oilseed rape cake increased the oxidation of CH4 and promoted soil C sequestration but inevitably increased the soil CO2 emissions.

Species and site contributions to β-diversity in fleas parasitic on the Palearctic small mammals: ecology, geography and host species composition matter the most	PARASITOLOGY												The beta-diversity of fleas parasitic on small mammals in 45 regions of the Palearctic was partitioned into species [species contributions to beta-diversity (SCBD)] and site ( = assemblage) contributions [local contributions to beta-diversity (LCBD)]. We asked what are the factors affecting SCBD and LCBD and tested whether (a) variation in ecological, morphological, life history and geographic traits of fleas can predict SCBD and (b) variation in flea and host community metrics, off-host environmental factors, host species composition of flea assemblages can predict LCBD. We used spatial variables to describe geographic distribution of flea assemblages with various LCBD values. SCBD significantly increased with an increase in abundance and a decrease in phylogenetic host specificity of a flea as well as with size and latitude of its geographic range, but was not associated with any morphological/life history trait. LCBD of flea assemblages did not depend on either flea or host species richness or environmental predictors, but was significantly affected by compositional uniqueness ( = LCBD) of regional host assemblages and variables describing their species composition. In addition, variation in LCBD was also explained by broad-to-moderate-scale spatial variables. We conclude that SCBD of fleas could be predicted via their ecological and geographic traits, whereas LCBD of their assemblages could be predicted via host composition.

Wendl.) Willd., in Ethiopia's Upper Blue Nile Basin. A particular focus of our study was on the different dimensions of livelihood sustainability centering on economic, social, human, physical, and natural capital. The unprecedented expansion of small-scale tree plantations in degraded agricultural land can be attributed to farmers' efforts to overcome the problems of limited income options and land degradation. However, these initiatives may have differential effects in terms of maintaining the sustainability of the natural environment and rural livelihoods. Interviews conducted with farmers revealed that the plantation system has yielded rich benefits by increasing their incomes, providing them with employment and improving their social lives. The plantations have also significantly improved degraded soils, thereby increasing natural capital. However, associated risks have also been found related to rising food prices, caused by a shift from annual to perennial crops and growing inequalities, with small farmers or those with limited financial resources having fewer options to invest in plantations. Moreover, in the face of such a positive overall impact of the plantation systems, the regulation of child labor, a potential issue, could become difficult. Apart from measures to address the issue of child labor, improved infrastructure and market access are required to help balance food security and plantation systems through functioning markets and financial systems that enable economically impoverished farmers to participate in this business. These findings offer important insights for research and policies seeking to sustain small-scale farmers' tree plantation systems, land use, and rural livelihoods.

These systems are not only meeting wood demand of wood-based industries but also contributing significantly in generating employment, reducing atmospheric CO(2)vis-a-vis mitigating climate change. The present study aimed at estimating area under poplar plantations and assessment of biomass production and carbon stock at district level for selected districts of Punjab and Haryana states. High resolution multispectral remote sensing data (LISS-IV, spatial resolution- 5.8 m) have been used for mapping poplar area in these districts. Growth data (tree density, diameter at breast height) from farmers' fields were collected for assessment of aboveground and total biomass. Poplar area in Hoshiarpur, Rupnagar, Ludhiana, Shahid Bhagat Singh Nagar, Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra and Karnal districts accounted for 3.19, 4.09, 1.02, 0.43, 7.25, 1.58 and 0.97%, respectively, of their geographical area. As percentage of agroforestry area, poplar area occupied 43.8% in four districts of Punjab and 53.4% in three districts of Haryana. Estimated carbon stock in total biomass of poplar plantations was 0.931, 0.481, 0.287, 0.040, 0.949, 0.256 and 0.229 million tonnes, respectively. CO(2)equivalent C in aboveground and total biomass was estimated to be 7.854 and 9.946 million t, respectively, in all these seven districts. The proposed methodology based on object-oriented image classification showed promising results as far as mapping of agroforestry systems/species is concerned.

This study employs a financial analysis technique, the computation of net present values, to explore the financial viability of farmers' investments in an intercropping farming system known as taungya. The analysis employs scenarios that include different farming systems, such as A. decurrens (J.C. Wendl.) Willd. cum teff (Eragrostis tef) intercropping, A. decurrens monocropping, and teff monocropping, as well as changes in output (charcoal and teff) prices and the discount rate. In addition, the time of sale is evaluated in terms of the distribution of profits between buyers and sellers and between sharecroppers and landowners. The intercropping practice (A. decurrens cum teff in the first year) tended to be more profitable than the alternative systems. Financially constrained farmers who have to sell their stands early, however, forego gains. Profits from stand sales later in the 5-year evaluation period were more equally shared between sellers and buyers. Sharecropping profits for farmers ranked among the lowest of the computed profits. A sensitivity analysis revealed that an increase in the discount rate tends to have a more detrimental effect than price fluctuations on the profitability of acacia-based taungya systems, although sharp price fluctuations could affect profitability and cause a farmer to shift back to an annual crop system. Despite their higher profitability, tree-based systems impose a risk of liquidity bottlenecks on farmers throughout the 5-year investment period, which implies that those who are endowed with land or who are more financially well-off can benefit from the required 5-year investment, but it may be more difficult for those who lack land or the necessary financial resources. Providing affordable financing for poorer and landless farmers could increase farmers' use of the taungya system and allow a more equitable distribution of benefits among the rural population.					nigussie, zerihun/AAV-9190-2020; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/L-8526-2013; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/J-5616-2015; Tsubo, Mitsuru/C-4027-2016; Nigussie, Zerihun/AAA-5865-2021	nigussie, zerihun/0000-0002-8001-2073; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/0000-0002-7690-0633; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/0000-0003-2920-8094; Tsubo, Mitsuru/0000-0002-8729-2215; Nigussie, Zerihun/0000-0002-8001-2073													0264-8377	1873-5754				JAN	2020	90								104331	10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104331	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104331													WOS:000503093800034

JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Inoculation with growth-promoting rhizobacteria inoculation and the addition of exogenous signaling molecules are two distinct strategies for improving heavy metal resistance and promoting growth in crops through several mechanisms. However, whether rhizobacteria and phyllosphere signaling molecules can act synergistically alleviate heavy metal stress and promote growth and the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, a novel strategy involving the co-application of growth-promoting rhizobacteria and an exogenous signaling molecule was developed to reduce cadmium (Cd) phytotoxicity and promote pak choi growth in Cd-contaminated soil. We found that the co-application of Azospirillum brasilense and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) resulted in significant improvements in shoot biomass and antioxidant enzyme content and a decline in the levels of Cd translocation factors. In addition, this co-application significantly improved pak choi Cd resistance. Furthermore, we observed a significant negative correlation between abscisic acid concentration and Cd content of pak choi and a positive correlation between H2S concentration and biomass. These findings revealed that the co-application of rhizobacteria and exogenous signaling molecules synergistically promoted the growth of vegetable crops subjected to heavy metal stress. Our results may serve as a guide for improving the food safety of crops grown in soil contaminated with heavy metals.

Synergies and trade-offs for climate-resilient agriculture in India: an agro-climatic zone assessment	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Globally, agriculture is recognized as a highly vulnerable sector to climate change and risks from climatic aberrations pose an imminent danger to the food security and sustainability of livelihoods. To bring robustness in climate adaptation planning, evaluation of resilience across homogenous regions is essential for developing and scaling suitable location-need-context specific interventions and policies that build the resilience of the agricultural system. In this paper, we present an analysis and discussion of multi-scalar and multi-indicator assessment, by profiling resilience across agro-climatic zones of India, based on the development of a Climate-Resilient Agriculture Index embracing environmental, technological, socio-economic, and institutional and infrastructural dimension. A total of 26 indicators, spread across these four dimensions, were employed to purport inter- and intra-agro-climatic zone differentials in the level of resilience. Among the zones, it was found that West Coast Plains & Ghats and Tans-Gangetic Plains had the highest degree of resilience to manage climate risks. Most of the districts lying within Eastern Himalayan Region, Middle Gangetic Plains, Eastern Plateau & Hills, and Western Dry Region had a lower degree of resilience. The study places greater emphasis on deciphering region-specific drivers and barriers to resilience at a further disaggregated scale for improving rural well-beings. It is construed that devising action plans emphasizing awareness, preservation of natural resources, diversification, building physical infrastructure, strengthening of grass-root institutions, and mainstreaming climate adaptation in the developmental policy is crucial for climate-resilient pathways.

Therefore, the erosion resistance provided by litter is important. To investigate the soil erosion-reducing efficiency of different types of litter, litter-covered sites of Populus simonii (LPS), Caragana korshinskii (LCK) and Bothriochloa ischaemum (LBI) were studied, respectively, and bare sandy land (BSL) was taken as a control. Results showed that litter cover increased the aerodynamic roughness by 44.9%-107.1% and the friction velocity by 11.5%-52.0%. Under the conditions of fixed coverage, changing wind speed and conditions of fixed wind speed, changing coverage, the average soil erosion-reducing efficiency both showed the highest in LBI, followed by LCK and LPS. According to the trend analysis, the critical coverage of litter of Populus simonii (PS), Caragana korshinskii (CK) and Bothriochloa ischaemum (BI) to reduce the soil erosion were 8.7%, 8.2% and 9.1%, respectively. We concluded that the soil erosion-reducing efficiency varied due to the shape of litter, and the difference was significant at high wind speed (10 m s(-1) and 12 m s(-1)). Besides, not all litter cover was effective in reducing erosion, and the critical coverage was a crucial factor that cannot be ignored.																			0140-1963	1095-922X				JAN	2022	196								104655	10.1016/j.jaridenv.2021.104655	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2021.104655		OCT 2021											WOS:000713010400004

The wind-water erosion crisscross region of the Chinese Loess Plateau is an example of such a region wherein erosion is caused by the stimulating effects of tillage, rainfall, and wind. Sheet erosion is an important form of cropland soil erosion and is closely correlated to the productive capacity of land. It is important to better understand the influence of tillage on soil sheet erosion in order to estimate the loss of fertile surface soil and to provide suitable tillage recommendations for the cultivation of sloping cropland in this region, which is susceptible to multiple erosion factors. This study aims to clarify spatial distribution and variation of sheet erosion rates as affected by different tillage patterns on sloping cropland under different slope conditions. We applied beryllium-7 measurements and sediment collection methods to estimate sheet erosion rates to reveal the distribution of sheet erosion on bare sloping fields, to determine correlations between sheet erosion rates and slopes (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25), and to analyze variation in sheet erosion affected by tillage patterns on a plot scale. Results show that sheet erosion increased in a top-down direction and achieved maximum values at the mid- or lower-mid section of slopes, then erosion rates decreased or sediment deposition occurred at the base of slopes. Sheet erosion intensified with an increase in slope gradient fitting to linear or exponential functions regardless of the tillage pattern used (i.e., whether solely applying autumn plowing or a combination of autumn and spring plowing). However, tillage patterns had an obvious effect on sheet erosion. Differences in sheet erosion caused by tillage patterns increased from 5 to between 15 and 20 before decreasing at 25. This demonstrates that steep slope gradients will weaken tillage pattern effects on sheet erosion, thus becoming a significant impacting factor on sheet erosion. Based on sheet erosion rates, we recommend that cropland be converted to grassland or shrubland when slope gradients are greater than 20 in the study region. Notably, a decrease in tillage intensity (frequency) helped in the reduction of sheet erosion on sloping croplands, and further tillage practices associated with conservation tillage should be applied on sloping cropland to obtain better soil erosion control results.						zhang, jia qiong/0000-0002-0539-3662													0167-1987	1879-3444				APR	2019	187						235	245		10.1016/j.still.2018.12.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2018.12.014													WOS:000458093900024

The experiment was performed as a split-plot experiment with three replications in two crop years (2014-2015). The main plot included two irrigation regimes ((I-1) rainfed irrigation and (I-2) supplementary irrigation) during two stages of development (spike emergence and grain filling). The sub-plot had eight foliar application levels: B, Zn, Mn, B + Zn, B + Mn, Zn + Mn, B + Zn + Mn, and distilled water (control). The foliar application of B, Zn, and Mn nano-chelates combined with supplementary irrigation or its sole application dramatically increased wheat's resistance to drought stress. Thousand kernel weight and the number of kernels per spike play a decisive role in grain yield. Therefore, the foliar application of nano-fertilizers can increase grain yield by improving these components. The highest grain yield (2528.33 kg/ha(-1)) was obtained in the supplementary irrigation condition after the combined foliar application of B + Mn + Zn nano-chelates. This condition led to a 41% increase compared to the highest grain yield obtained under rainfed conditions after the foliar application of Zn nano-chelates (1490 kg/ha(-1)).					sayfzadeh, saeed/ABB-7613-2021	sayfzadeh, saeed/0000-0002-3960-7999													0190-4167	1532-4087				MAY 28	2023	46	9					1988	2002		10.1080/01904167.2022.2105719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2022.2105719		JUL 2022											WOS:000836052400001
J	Su, ZX; Shangguan, ZP				Su, Zhuoxia; Shangguan, Zhouping			Nitrogen addition decreases the soil cumulative priming effect and favours soil net carbon gains in<i> Robinia</i><i> pseudoacacia</i> plantation soil	GEODERMA												Carbon (C) and nutrient inputs regulate the soil carbon balance by affecting microbial growth and the priming effect (PE). However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the microbial mechanism of the soil carbon balance. To examine the regulatory effect of C or nutrient deficiency on microbial C turnover in forest systems of different ages, we collected soil from two Robinia pseudoacacia stands of different ages and conducted an incu-bation experiment using 13C-labelled glucose combined with nitrogen and/or phosphorus (N and/or P) addition. We determined 13C partitioning in CO2 and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Glucose and nutrient addition caused both positive and negative PEs during the 30-day incubation. The PE of the 15-year-old (15Y) stand changed from positive (0-15 days) to negative (15-30 days), while the PE of the 45-year-old (45Y) stand ranged from negative (0.5 days) to positive (after 1 day). Different microbial mechanisms play diverse roles during various decomposition stages. The 45Y stand led to a higher cumulative positive PE than the 15Y stand. For both stands, fungi assimilated a greater proportion of 13C-glucose in the glucose plus nitrogen (CN addition) treatment than in the glucose addition alone treatment, which alleviated the fungal N requirements and decreased the cumulative PE. However, the glucose plus phosphorous treatment (CP addition) had no significant influence on the cumulative PE. CN addition favoured high-yielding microbial strategists (Y-strategists) and glucose-derived SOC accumulation. This phenomenon was supported by the relatively high microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), which increased the soil net C balance. In contrast, CP addition was conducive to resource-acquisition strategists (A-strategists), which increased soil organic carbon mineralization and decreased the soil net C bal-ance. This was evidenced by higher 13C incorporation into the PLFAs of gram-positive bacteria and the positive PE for C and nutrient acquisition under CP addition. Consequently, CN addition decreased the cumulative PE and increased 13C-fungi and CUE, which favoured the soil net C gain. Our study highlights the importance of N fertilization for soil C sequestration in Robinia pseudoacacia plantations.						zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310													0016-7061	1872-6259				MAY	2023	433								116444	10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116444		MAR 2023											WOS:000966137300001

Evaluation of calibration subsetting and new chemometric methods on the spectral prediction of key soil properties in a data-limited environment	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE					Pedometrics Conference	JUN 26-JUL 01, 2017	Wageningen, NETHERLANDS					Few studies have systematically investigated the effects of subsetting strategies on soil modelling or explored the potential of emergent methods from other fields not previously applied to pedometrics. This study considers smallholder agricultural villages in southern India that have been understudied in terms of chemometric modelling intended to support soil health, fertility and management. Therefore, the objective was to investigate the application of visible near-infrared spectroscopy and chemometrics to predict soil properties in this setting. In addition, this study evaluated the effects of methods of calibration subsetting and new parametric models on the prediction of soil properties. These novel methods were transferred from the genomics field to soil science. Three strategic subsetting methods were used to produce calibration subsets that consider the variation in the soil properties, the spectra and both together; this is in addition to standard random calibration subsetting. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and two methods from genomics that impose variable reduction were used for modelling; the latter were sparse PLSR (SPLSR) and the heteroscedastic effects model (HEM). Soil samples were collected from two villages and analysed for texture, soil carbon and available macro-and micro-nutrients. The results showed that soil texture and carbon could be predicted moderately to strongly, whereas plant nutrient properties were predicted poorly to moderately. Random subsetting and subsetting by property distribution were more appropriate when spectra varied less overall, whereas subsetting that incorporates variation in spectra and properties improved results when spectral variation increased. The SPLSR and HEM models improved results over PLSR in some cases, or at least maintained prediction strength while using fewer predictors. Subsetting methods improved prediction results in 75% of cases. This study filled an important research gap by systematically studying local subsetting behaviour under different degrees of spectral and attribute variation.																			1351-0754	1365-2389				JAN	2019	70	1			SI		107	126		10.1111/ejss.12753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12753													WOS:000457540900013

The relationship between soil water consumption and N uptake and utilization has not previously been widely investigated. The purpose of this study was to examine the regulatory effects of different seeding rates with wide-space sowing on water consumption and N accumulation and translocation of winter wheat. A field experiment was conducted in the southeastern part of the Loess Plateau between 2016 and 2018, in which winter wheat was sown using the wide-space method (row spacing: 22-25 cm, and seedling bandwidth: 5-8 cm) and five seeding rates: 150, 225, 300, 375, and 450 kg seeds ha(-1). The results showed that soil water consumption increased significantly with an increase in the seeding rate from 150-300 kg seeds ha(-1), especially from the jointing to maturity stage of wheat growth. At 300 kg seeds ha(-1), N translocation from the leaf and stem + sheath to the grains was significantly enhanced, which increased grain N accumulation. The maximum tiller number, water use efficiency, N uptake efficiency, and partial factor productivity from applied N were all recorded at a seeding rate of 300 kg seeds ha(-1), thus, grain yield increased significantly by 6-18%. Correlation analysis showed that N accumulation from the sowing to anthesis stage, pre-anthesis N translocation, and the grain yield of winter wheat were closely related to total soil water consumption. Overall, the findings of this study have demonstrated that wide-space sowing of winter wheat at a 300 kg seeds ha(-1) seeding rate improved the water use efficiency and N uptake efficiency, which in turn increased the tiller number and grain yield.					wang, zhixin/GZH-2500-2022; Noor, Hafeez/ACW-9827-2022; Khan, Shahbaz/AAZ-3678-2020	Noor, Hafeez/0000-0003-3758-0857; 													1735-6814	1735-8043				DEC	2021	15	4					553	562		10.1007/s42106-021-00155-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42106-021-00155-3		AUG 2021											WOS:000683217100001

In Japan, there have been many studies of the relationship between ambulance transports owing to heat stroke (ATHS) and high air temperature in the summer season. However, there have been very few reports focusing on ATHS in spring. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the maximum air temperature on ATHS not only in summer but also in spring, to help with development of effective measures to prevent heat stroke. Methods We obtained daily ATHS and meteorological data from April to September in 2017 in Tottori Prefecture. We used a time-stratified case-crossover method for data analysis. Results A total 382 cases of ATHS were identified from April to September in 2017 in Tottori. The number of cases was highest in July, followed by August and May. Maximum air temperature was significantly linked to ATHS. The risk of ATHS was increased 1.13 times when maximum air temperature rose by 1 degrees C. In summer, the risk on extremely hot days (maximum air temperature >= 35 degrees C) increased by 5.55 times or more compared with that on days below 30 degrees C (< 30 degrees C). The risk was approximately four times greater on hot days (>= 30 degrees C and < 35 degrees C) than that on relatively cooler days (< 30 degrees C) during the spring months of April through May. Conclusion Maximum air temperature was significantly linked to ATHS. It is necessary to pay particular attention to heat stroke prevention not only on extremely hot days in summer but also on hot days in the spring.

The ecohydrological impact of water resource developments through inundation regime analysis of a large semi-arid floodplain	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The ephemeral inundation of floodplains in semi-arid and arid zone climates is an essential driver of biological productivity. Natural biota depend on floodplain inundation to support critical reproductive life phases. In historical times, grazing industries have developed taking advantage of phases of high productivity associated with the overbank flow. However, the modelling of inundation in lowland floodplains is challenged by the complexity of topographic and hydrodynamic constraints. Here we apply a spatially explicit fine-scale inundation model to compare floodplain inundation regimes associated with current hydrological development on the Darling River floodplain, Australia, and pre-development, conceptualised as the removal of hydrological control structures. Our results suggest that hydrological developments in the Darling River catchment have substantially increased inter-flood period, an effect particularly pronounced during dry climatic phases. The result explains the decline in waterbird utilisation in this section of the Darling River, the low resilience of outer floodplain vegetation to the recent drought, and the reduction in grazing capacity. Water resource development had less impact on large inundation events.

J	Gao, Y; Zhang, P; Liu, JB				Gao, Yang; Zhang, Ping; Liu, Jiabin			One third of the abiotically-absorbed atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> by the loess soil is conserved in the solid phase	GEODERMA												It has frequently been noticed that alkaline soils in arid and semiarid areas can absorb atmospheric CO2 abiotically. However, the fate of the absorbed CO2 is largely unknown, limiting our ability to accurately assess the contribution of abiotic CO2 absorption to carbon sequestration. The hypothesis that some abiotically-absorbed carbon could be fixed in the soil solid phase is yet to be explicitly tested. From April to November 2016, we added (CO2)-C-13 to the natural alkaline loess soil at a depth of 0-17 cm and quantified the proportion of (CO2)-C-13 conserved in the soil solid phase on the central Loess Plateau of China. The results showed that natural surface soil absorbed (CO2)-C-13 at a rate of 475.9 mg m(-2) d(-1). Of the absorbed (CO2)-C-13, 33.2% was conserved in the soil solid phase. The rate of added (CO2)-C-13 conserved in the solid phase was positively correlated with mean monthly soil water content but negatively correlated with mean monthly soil temperature. Our results indicated that, loess soil can absorb CO2 from the atmosphere through abiotic processes, and part of the abiotically-absorbed CO2 is stably fixed in the soil solid phase. Soil with a higher water content and lower temperature may promote the abiotic CO2 fixation. The rate of CO2 fixation through abiotic processes at the surface soil accounted for approximately 10%-20% of the reported local annual net ecosystem exchange, implying that the abiotic CO2 uptake by loess soil may play an important role in assessing the capacity of CO2 sequestration in these areas.

OA provided the African intellectual community with a tool to prove its academic prowess and an opportunity to display cultural and intellectual independence. OA publishing is prone to abuse, and some in Africa have sought to exploit the OA boom to profit from non-academic activity rather than use this tool to glorify Africa's image and diversity on the global intellectual stage. These issues are explored in detail in the paper. Design/methodology/approach The authors broadly assessed literature that is related to the growth and challenges associated with OA, including the rise of OA mega journals, in Africa. Findings African OA journals and publishers have to compete with established non-African OA entities. Some are considered "predatory", but this Jeffrey Beall-based classification may be erroneous. Publishing values that African OA publishers and journals aspire to should not equal those published by non-African publishing entities. Africa should seek solutions to the challenges on that continent via Africa-based OA platforms. The budding African OA movement is applauded, but it must be held as accountable as any other OA journal or publisher. Originality/value African scholars need to reassess the "published in Africa" OA image.

Visha			Evaluating the long-term impact of projected climate on rice-lentil-groundnut cropping system in Lower Gangetic Plain of India using crop simulation modelling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY												Most simulations of food production in response to various climates to date have used simulations of the same crop over multiple years. This study evaluated the impact of projected climate on performance of rice-lentil-groundnut cropping sequence in New Alluvial Zone of West Bengal, India, using DSSAT model. The study period consisted of baseline (1980-2010), mid-century (2040-2069) and end-century (2070-2099). Advancement in days to anthesis (2-13 days) was simulated for rice during the future periods. For lentil and groundnut, average advancement in days to anthesis was 1 day. Days to maturity were shortened by 3-16 days for rice and 0-7 days for lentil. Nevertheless, for groundnut, the days to maturity were simulated to increase by 1-9 days. The impact on final biomass and yield was simulated with and without CO2 fertilization, and the positive impact of CO2 fertilization was prominent for all the three crops. When CO2 fertilization effect was considered, the yield of rice was projected to increase by 11-32%. On the other hand, yield of lentil and groundnut was estimated to change by - 31 to - 12% and - 33 to + 8%, respectively. Enhanced CO2 could mitigate the magnitude of yield reduction due to enhanced temperature. Rice was benefited due to the carryover effect of residue from preceding groundnut and, hence, could sustain the yield on a long term. The study could also quantify the uncertainty in simulation of yield due to selection of GCMs.					M.A., Sarath Chandran/ABG-3178-2021; Visha Kumari, Venugopalan/HJO-8492-2023	M.A., Sarath Chandran/0000-0002-0824-0426; Visha Kumari, Venugopalan/0000-0001-6901-680X; Nanda, M K/0000-0003-2557-2657													0020-7128	1432-1254				JAN	2022	66	1					55	69		10.1007/s00484-021-02189-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-021-02189-8		SEP 2021						34554286					WOS:000698552900001

J	Xiao, LG; Kuhn, NJ; Zhao, RQ; Cao, LH				Xiao, Liangang; Kuhn, Nikolaus J.; Zhao, Rongqin; Cao, Lianhai			Net effects of conservation agriculture principles on sustainable land use: A synthesis	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Despite the strong recommendations from scientists, to till or not to till remains a confusing question for many farmers around the world due to the worries of crop yield decline and negative impacts on soils and environment. A confused understanding of the role of the individual principles of conservation agriculture significantly limits the effectiveness and applicability of soil conservation strategies and frameworks to achieve sustainable agriculture. By distinguishing clearly between the different principles of conservation agriculture, the net effects of no-tillage on improving and sustaining agro-ecosystems are analyzed based on 49 recent meta-analyses in this study. The review shows that no-tillage leads to a significant decline of crop yield (-8.0% to 10.0%, median: -1.9%), whereas residue retention represents the key driver for improving crop production (4.0%-28.0%, median: 8.2%). The efficacy of no-tillage for water erosion control, especially runoff (-24.0% to -0.7%, median: -10.0%), is often insignificant and otherwise lower compared to residue retention (-87.0% to -14.0%, median: -45.5%). Soil carbon sequestration potential under conservation tillage is quite limited or even close to zero, and if any, it can likely be attributed to the associated residue retention (-0.1% to 12.8%, median: 9.7%) rather than no-tillage (-2.0% to 10.0%, median: 4.8%). Our analysis illustrates that in conservation agriculture, no-tillage as the original and central principle of soil management is often less effective than associated supplementary measures, in particular residue retention. Residue retention may therefore play a key role for achieving sustainable land use. An additional benefit of residue retention is the less dramatic change of farming practices compared to no-tillage. The results of this review illustrate that a new framework for assessing the benefits of conservation practices has to be developed. To till, or not to till, is not the question: residue retention seems more critical.																			1354-1013	1365-2486				DEC	2021	27	24					6321	6330		10.1111/gcb.15906	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15906		OCT 2021						34583427					WOS:000704677300001

Here, we determined the values of the parameters in the Feddes root water uptake function for sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) under drought and salinity stresses in a pot experiment using "Lebap-55", which has been bred for the drylands of the Aral Sea Basin but is moderately sensitive to salinity stress. We measured the hourly values of the transpiration, soil moisture, and salinity in the upper and lower soil layers in pots, solar radiation, and root distribution. The values were quantified by two methods. The bulk method uses only daily pot weight data, and the average soil water content and salt concentration are back-calculated from the mass balance. The inverse method uses the monitored values of the soil water content and salinity as well as daily weight data and solar radiation. Both methods could successfully estimate all the parameter values for both stresses. The bulk method performed better under drought stress, even without the measured soil water content or root distribution. It also had satisfactory accuracy in estimating the values under salinity stress. Both methods performed better under drought stress than under salinity stress. The parameter values determined here could be used for irrigation scheduling and salinity management using numerical models for the studied crop.

Developing the new crop genotypes with high productivity under N deficiency is an important approach to maintain agricultural production. Therefore, understanding how plant response to N deficiency and the mechanism of N-deficiency tolerance are very important for sustainable development of modern crop production. Results In this study, the physiological responses and fatty acid composition were investigated in 24 wheat cultivars under N-deficient stress. Through Pearson's correlation analysis and principal component analysis, the responses of 24 wheat cultivars were evaluated. The results showed that the plant growth and carbohydrate metabolism were all differently affected by N deficiency in all tested wheat cultivars. The seedlings that had high shoot biomass also maintained high level of chlorophyll content under N deficiency. Moreover, the changes in fatty acid composition, especially the linolenic acid (18:3) and the double bond index (DBI), showed close positive correlations with the shoot dry weight and chlorophyll content alterations in response to N-deficient condition. These results indicated that beside the chlorophyll content, the linolenic acid content and DBI may also contribute to N-deficiency adaptation, thus could be considered as efficient indicators for evaluation of different response in wheat seedlings under N-deficient condition. Conclusions The alteration in fatty acid composition can potentially contribute to N-deficiency tolerance in plants, and the regulation of fatty acid compositions maybe an effective strategy for plants to adapt to N-deficient stress.

Crop rotation and conservation tillage appears to serve as an effective strategy to optimize water resources distribution and utilization. From 2007-2019, a 12-yr in-situ experiment consisting of three cropping systems (winter wheat continuous cropping, WW; winter wheat-spring maize rotation, WM; spring maize continuous cropping, MM) and two tillage methods (conservation tillage, subsoiling, ST; conventional tillage, plowing, CT) were conducted in a semi-arid region, and grain yield, economic profit, water use, precipitation storage and loss, soil water balance were analyzed to explore the mechanism and potential of crop rotation and conservation tillage regulating soil water balance and increasing farmland productivity. Our results show that compared to WW, WM and MM significantly enhanced grain yield by 4358 and 8791 kg ha-1 in 2-yr rotation cycle, respectively. And ST increased grain yield after 3 cycles with 979 kg ha-1. WM and MM with ST significantly reduced precipitation loss (78 and 135 mm) during the fallow period, and increased WUE (6.5 and 10.8 kg ha-1 mm-1), compared to WW-CT. With the passage of time, soil water storage of WW and MM showed a decreasing trend in 100-200 and 0-100 cm layers compared to pre-experiment, with the rate of 18.1 and 13.6 mm per cycle. And ST could ease the downward trend, relative to CT. However, the WM-ST maintained soil water balance by regulating water use and precipitation storage, compared to the two continuous cropping systems. Additionally, correlation analysis showed that evapotranspiration was positive to soil water balance and we should consider crop water use when designing cropping system to prevent soil water deficit. Overall, the WM-ST achieved better soil water sustainability, on the basis of sacrificing grain yield partly (4646 kg ha-1 in 2-yr rotation cycle) compared to MM-ST, which perhaps more eco-friendly and sustainable agricultural technique to replace WW-CT in the Loess Plateau of China.

Improved plant yield efficiency alleviates the erratic optimum density in maize	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Plant yield efficiency (PYE) reflects the ability of the single-plant to respond to additional inputs and is fully expressed at the nil-competition regime (an ultra-low density to preclude inter-plant interference for inputs). The purpose of this study was to determine if PYE could prevent the erratic optimum plant density-yield interaction effect in maize (Zea mays L.). Seven hybrids were evaluated across five environments at four densities, under both the normal-input regime (NIR) and low-input regime (LIR). Plant yield efficiency was measured at the lowest density approaching the nil-competition regime (0.74 plants m(-2)), while crop (per area) yield potential was estimated at the highest density corresponding to the typical farming density in the NIR (8.89 plants m(-2)). In terms of optimum density, the hybrids varied extensively in the NIR (6.64-8.81 plants m(-2)) but performed similarly in the LIR (5.11-5.61 plants m(-2)). The hybrid displaying the highest PYE also had high harvest index (HI) and low anthesis to silking interval (ASI) and was proved the most stable according to various stability statistics including the genotype and genotype by environment (GGE) biplot model. In conclusion, crop yield by density interaction is a matter of hybrid. Hybrids with low PYE have inconsistent optimum density, which is a causal factor of yield loss in rainfed maize. High PYE improves hybrid flexibility and performance at low densities ultimately enhancing crop resilience to extremely fluctuating environments.

Yield determination of maize hybrids under limited irrigation	JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT												Hybrid adoption, irrigation, and planting density are important factors for maize (Zea mays L.) production in semiarid regions. For this study, a 2-yr field experiment was conducted in the Texas High Plains to investigate maize yield determination, seasonal evapotranspiration (ETc), and water-use efficiency (WUE) under limited irrigation. Two hybrids (N74R, a conventional hybrid, and N75H, a drought-tolerant (DT) hybrid) were planted at three water regimes (I-100, I-75, and I-50, referring to 100%, 75%, and 50% of the evapotranspiration requirement) and three planting densities (PD 6, PD 8, and PD 10, referring to 6, 8, and 10 seeds m(-2)). At I-50, drought stress reduced grain yield by 4.78t/ha for the conventional hybrid but only 4.22t/ha for the DT hybrid, when compared to I-100. Although ETc decreased at I-75 and I-50, the highest WUE was found at I-75. The DT hybrid did not yield more than the conventional hybrid but had greater yield stability at lower water regimes and extracted less soil water. Drought decreased biomass, harvest index, and kernel weight but did not affect kernel number. Higher planting densities increased biomass and kernel number but decreased kernel weight. Kernel number and kernel weight of the conventional hybrid were more sensitive to planting density than the DT hybrid. These data demonstrated that limited irrigation at I-75 is an effective way to save water and maintain the maize yield in semiarid areas, and that DT hybrid shows a greater yield stability to plant density under water stress.

Different vegetation types exhibit variations in the main soil layers where PF occurs, which is closely related to the distribution of roots. The PF proportion varies significantly both vertically and horizontally. Based on the Random Forests, we found that the spatial distribution of the PF proportion is mainly controlled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity and residual soil moisture, which cannot be identified by conventional correlation analysis methods. With these soil properties, the spatial distribution of the PF proportion can be estimated with reasonable performance. Using the Classification and Regression Trees method, we identified the temporal occurrence pattern of the PF for different vegetation types and all observation stations. Results indicate that the dominant factors controlling the temporal occurrence of the PF varied for different vegetation types. The thresholds at which these factors initiate the PF also varied. Finally, we found that the PF occurs particularly under wet conditions (except for hydrophobic soils), under denser vegetation, and under conditions of high rainfall amount and intensity, regardless of vegetation type. Our study confirms that both site factors (e.g., soil properties and vegetation) and temporal factors (e.g., initial soil moisture and rainfall characteristics) control the occurrence of the PF in mountainous regions such as the Qilian Mountains and that the Classification and Regression Trees has great potential to study the temporal occurrence of the PF.					tian, jie/ABD-4663-2021; He, Chansheng/A-3337-2008	tian, jie/0000-0002-4845-5085; He, Chansheng/0000-0001-7748-0485													0016-7061	1872-6259				OCT	2023	438								116626	10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116626		AUG 2023											WOS:001064678500001

We investigated CH4 concentration in the heartwood of living trees in dominant upland forests using field campaign and subsequently evaluated the importance of stem CH4 emission in the context of the global total. We found that only 0%, 9.8%, and 1.8% of stems of living trees had substantial CH4 concentration in heartwood of >= 10,000 mu L L-1 in the boreal, temperate, and tropical and subtropical upland forests investigated, respectively. CH4 concentration in heartwood depended mainly upon tree species and subsequently soil moisture. Relationships fitted indicate that CH4 concentration followed a power function with respect to water content in heartwood, whereas nitrous oxide (N2O) or carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration linearly increased with water content in heartwood. Stem CH4 emission was estimated at approximately 0.2-2 Tg yr(-1) globally, corresponding to less than 0.4% of the global total including all natural plus anthropogenic sources. Water content in heartwood is positively associated with soil water content. Soil water content rarely exceeds 40% v/v in upland forests, indicating stem CH4 emission occurs mainly in the areas of low-lying upland forests with occasionally moist soils. More attentions should be paid on low-lying upland forests and forested wetlands in future when stem CH4 emission needs to be estimated in all forests.

Straw mulching is more important than no tillage in yield improvement on the Chinese Loess Plateau	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Conservation agriculture (CA) represents an efficient agro-ecosystems management for sustained crop production under the circumstances of global warming. However, the relative importance of three principles of CA has not been comprehensively assessed. Consequently, it has caused a controversy of whether no tillage (NT) is beneficial for crop yield improvement compared to conventional tillage, ranging from significant decrease to significant or insignificant increase. It remains unclear whether such a controversy is caused by statistical methodology or different acknowledge of the CA principles. This study aimed to clarify the relative importance of various tillage and straw mulching practices in crop yield, evapotraspiration (ET), and water use efficiency (WUE). Published data from experiments reporting the effects of CA on changes of crop yield and water use on the Chinese Loess Plateau were collected. A database of 49 sets of paired experiments was compiled, with tillage practices including conventional tillage without straw mulching (CT), conventional tillage with straw mulching (CTs), no tillage without straw mulching (NT), no tillage with straw mulching (NTs), reduced tillage without straw mulching (RT), reduced tillage with straw mulching (RTs), and subsoiling with straw mulching (Ss). Variable-controlling approach was used to divide these practices into reasonable groups. Paired t-tests were further conducted to systematically evaluate the relative importance of tillage reduction and straw mulching. The results showed the sole application of straw mulching as well as the combination of straw mulching and tillage reduction both resulted in a significant increase of crop yield. Tillage reduction itself including NT and RT caused a significant crop yield decline. The sole application of tillage reduction or straw mulching has neutral or negative impacts, whereas the combination of tillage reduction and straw mulching has neutral to positive on ET changes. WUE changes were similar to that of crop yield. The results illustrated that the increased crop yield reported on the Loess Plateau area is mainly due to the application of straw mulching, rather than the adoption of NT. The positive influences of CA practices on crop yield and water use tend to be higher under dry climate conditions compared to humid climate conditions. In addition, the adoption of paired t-test significantly improves the evaluation of the effects of CA compared to one way-ANOVA (LSD). Overall, the results help clarify the higher importance of straw mulching over tillage reduction and therefore challenge the centrality of NT in crop yield and WUE improvement.					zhao, Rongqin/AAH-7513-2020														0167-1987	1879-3444				NOV	2019	194								104314	10.1016/j.still.2019.104314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.104314													WOS:000486360400029

A field study was conducted during two consecutive cycles of a wheat (Triticwn aestivum L.) - maize (Zea mays L.) cropping system within the Tangling District of Northwest China to evaluate the effects of different mulch cultivation practices on soil water contents and soil temperatures (EM50 probes), crop yields, and water use efficiency (WUE). Four treatments were evaluated: (1) a flat plot without mulch control treatment (CK), (2) a flat plot with straw mulch (SM), (3) a flat plot with plastic film mulch (PM), and (4) a ridge-furrow planting with film mulch over the ridge and wheat straw mulch over the furrow (PSM). All mulch treatments significantly improved grain yields and WUE of the winter wheat and summer maize in comparison with CK. The highest grain yields and WUE occurred in the PSM treatment over the two wheat-maize cycles. The average soil water storage within the 0-200 cm soil layer was 3.82%, 2.25%, and 1.31% higher under the PSM, PM, and SM treatments, respectively, in comparison to the CK treatment.Although the soil mulching practices insignificantly changed the total crop evapotranspiration (ET) with a small quantity compared with non-mulched treatment, they tended to reduce non-productive soil evaporation (E) and increase productive plant transpiration (T). All mulching treatments increased the soil temperature of the winter wheat from the seedling to the regreening stages and helped prevent freeze damage. The PSM and SM treatments effectively inhibited the excessive soil temperature rise during the growth stage for summer maize. The PSM treatment resulted in favorable soil moisture and temperature conditions that increased the grain yields and water use efficiency of winter wheat and summer maize. Therefore, we concluded that ridge-furrow planting with film mulch over ridge and wheat straw mulch over the furrow is an effective management practice to increase yields and WUE in a winter wheat-summer maize crop rotation within this sub-humid drought-prone region.

J	Zhang, BJ; Zhang, GH; Yang, HY; Zhu, PZ				Zhang, Bao-jun; Zhang, Guang-hui; Yang, Han-yue; Zhu, Ping-zong			Temporal variation in soil erosion resistance of steep slopes restored with different vegetation communities on the Chinese Loess Plateau	CATENA												Vegetation growth can stimulate the changes in near soil-surface characteristics during a growing season in arid and semi-arid regions, and hence likely induces the temporal variation in soil erosion resistance, reflected by rill erodibility (K-r) and critical shear stress (tau(c)). This study investigated the temporal variations in soil erosion resistance of steep slopes restored with different vegetation communities on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The undisturbed topsoil samples, taken from one control cropland and seven vegetation communities at steep gully slopes, were scoured in a hydraulic flume under six different flow shear stresses. Sampling was conducted for seven times from April 23 to October 10, 2018. Near soil-surface characteristics were simultaneously determined to identify the major influencing factors for the temporal variation in soil erosion resistance. The results showed that the temporal variations in K-r of different vegetation communities differed significantly from that of the control. The relative K-r of vegetation-restored soils decreased exponentially over time. The temporal variations in tau(c) were also significantly different from the control for the vegetated samples. Vegetation restoration was effective to enhance soil erosion resistance, and the grass communities were more effective than shrub communities. Compared to control cropland, the mean K-r of vegetation-restored soils decreased by 72%-96%, while the mean tau(c) increased by 100%-183%. The major factors responsible for the temporal variations in K-r and tau(c) were the seasonal variations in root mass density, soil cohesion, and water stable aggregates. K-r decreased exponentially, while tau(c) increased logarithmically with root mass density, soil cohesion, and water stable aggregates.						zhang, guanghui/0000-0002-3801-8439													0341-8162	1872-6887				NOV	2019	182								104170	10.1016/j.catena.2019.104170	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.104170													WOS:000482493700054
J	Zhang, BJ; Zhang, GH; Yang, HY; Wang, H				Zhang, Bao-jun; Zhang, Guang-hui; Yang, Han-yue; Wang, Hao			Soil resistance to flowing water erosion of seven typical plant communities on steep gully slopes on the Loess Plateau of China	CATENA												Steep gully slopes are widespread and have been recognized as the main sediment source on the Loess Plateau. Different vegetation growth may lead to the differences in soil properties and plant roots, and thus likely affects soil resistance to flowing water erosion, reflected by rill erodibility and critical shear stress. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate this effect on steep gully slopes on the Loess Plateau of China. This study was performed to investigate the effects of vegetation growth on soil resistance to flowing water erosion on steep gully slopes, and quantify the main potential influencing factors on the Loess Plateau. Three typical shrub communities and four typical grass communities that distributed on different gully slopes were selected. 240 undisturbed soil samples were collected from these seven gully slope lands and one slope farmland (control), and were subjected to detachment by overland flow under six different shear stresses (6.64 to 17.85 Pa). The results showed that the mean detachment capacity of slope farmland was 6.9 to 47.8 times greater than those of steep gully slopes covered with different plant communities. The rill erodibilities of steep gully slopes covered with different plant communities reduced greatly by 77.0% to 95.1% compared to the control slope. The critical shear stress of slope farmland (2.72 Pa) was only 57.2% and 39.6% of that of shrubland (4.76 Pa) and grassland (6.88 Pa). Both shrub and grass communities were effective in reducing soil detachment capacity and rill erodibility, and increasing critical shear stress on steep gully slopes. But the effects were more obvious for the grass communities. The differences in rill erodibility between slope farmland and gully slope lands were mainly explained by the changes in root mass density (82.4%). Plant roots had strong direct effects on increasing soil cohesion (0.78), organic matter content (0.56), and water stable aggregation (0.92). Rill erodibility was negatively related to root mass density as an exponential function (p < 0.05), and soil cohesion and water stable aggregation as power functions (p < 0.05). Critical shear stress was positively related to root mass density and soil water stable aggregation following a logarithmic function.						zhang, guanghui/0000-0002-3801-8439													0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2019	173						375	383		10.1016/j.catena.2018.10.036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.10.036													WOS:000452814300036

In this study, we analyzed the phase differentiation characteristics of water-sediment variations during the flood season in the Huangfuchuan basin using a long-term dataset. We elucidated the complex response relationship between water-sediment variations and meteorological factors and human activities, which is of great significance for revealing the mechanisms of water-sediment variations in the region and establishing a scientific water-sediment regulation system in the basin. Statistical methods such as the Mann-Kendall trend test, Sen's slope estimation, Pettitt nonparametric test, and principal component analysis were employed to identify and analyze the trends and dominant driving factors before and after the water-sediment variations and abrupt changes in parameters such as rainfall and temperature in the Huangfuchuan basin. Additionally, multiple regression analysis was used to determine the extent of the contribution of climate and human activities to water-sediment variations in the Huangfuchuan basin. The study revealed that the year 2000 was a turning point for water-sediment variations, with decreases of 11.3%, 76.7%, and 85.1% in flood season rainfall, flood season runoff, and flood season sediment transport, respectively. Despite significant changes in the underlying surface conditions of the Huangfuchuan basin, the relationship between flood season sediment transport and flood season runoff remained a power-law relationship. In the absence of obvious abrupt changes in temperature, rainfall, and other meteorological factors, the changes in the underlying surface caused by human activities are the main cause of the changes in runoff and sediment yield in the Huangfuchuan basin. The current level of vegetation restoration in the Huangfuchuan basin is still relatively low, making it difficult to exert stronger control on sediment yield during the flood season. Meanwhile, human activities, primarily based on engineering measures, play a more significant role in the control of soil and water loss in the basin.																				2071-1050				SEP	2023	15	18							13632	10.3390/su151813632	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151813632													WOS:001074202500001

This study calculated the blue, grey, green and total water footprints of spring maize production in Northeast China in 2019 and 2020 and compared the water footprint values at the provincial and municipal scales. In addition, this study analyzed the spatial variation and drivers of the water footprint. The results show that the average water footprints of spring maize production in Northeast China in 2019 and 2020 were 1.78 m3kg-1 and 2.00 m3kg-1, out of which the grey water footprint contributed the most, accounting for 55.19% and 49.85% of the total water footprint, respectively, while the blue water footprint contributed the least, accounting for only 17.44% and 18.68% of the total water footprint. At the provincial level, the water footprint of spring maize production in Northeast China was spatially clustered, with the lowest total water footprint in Heilongjiang Province and the highest total water footprint in Jilin Province. The spatial distribution difference of the spring maize unit yield was the fundamental factor explaining the difference in the water footprint. The precipitation, surface water resources, average temperature, effective irrigated area and the proportion of effective irrigated area also had impacts on the water footprint. This study provides a scientific basis for optimizing the distribution of spring maize production in Northeast China, formulating appropriate sustainable water resource management plans, improving water-use efficiency and realizing sustainable water resource management in Northeast China.

The goal of this work was to explore the impact of feed type and geograph-ical conditions on the growth dynamics of sheep feed with three different diets - sorghum stover (Vizag district), groundnut halums (Krishna district) and red gram chunni (Ranga Reddy district). Animals were fed these diets at night daily for 90 days after their routine daytime grazing. The study regions varied in altitude, annual rainfall and mean temperature. Soil analysis was performed in these regions to check for pH, mineral content, organic carbon and bacterial composition. Growth dynamics (average daily gain of 41.56-77.11 g per day) and feed conversion ratios (6.26-10.93) differed markedly (p < 0.05) among ani-mals in the three regions. Metagenomics sampling of sheep ruminal fluid from sheep reared in the three distinct regions (and separate feed types) was carried out by sequencing 16S rRNA V3-V4 regions. Comparison of alpha diversity and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness showed remarkable vari-ations in the Chao1, ACE, Shannon and Simpson indices. The results of this work reveal the relationship between feed type, geographical location and ruminal microflora composition. The presence of numerous genera and species differences were discovered in the three samples, and the presence of several metha-nogens was confirmed. In conclusion methane emissions from cattle and sheep may be mitigated by altering the feed type, which directly influences the ruminal and gut microflora composition. Further research is recommended in order to determine the optimal relationship between soil and feed and their impact on the nutritional status of ruminants in rainfed areas, taking into account various farming and agroclimatic conditions.

This study examined the effects of root pruning on maize yield, WUE, and water uptake under pot and hydroponic conditions. The pot experiment showed that root pruning significantly decreased root/shoot ratio. Both small root pruning (cut off about 1/5 of the root system, RP1) and large root pruning (cut off about 1/3 of the root system, RP2) improved WUE and root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) in the residual root system. Compared with that in the un-cut control, at the jointing stage, RP1 and RP2 increased Lpr by 43.9% and 31.5% under well-watered conditions and 27.4% and 19.8% under drought stress, respectively. RP1 increased grain yield by 12.9% compared with that in the control under well-watered conditions, whereas both pruning treatments did not exhibit a significant effect on yield under drought stress. The hydroponic experiment demonstrated that root pruning did not reduce leaf water potential but increased residual root hydraulic conductivity by 26.2% at 48 h after root pruning under well-watered conditions. The foregoing responses may be explained by the upregulation of plasma membrane intrinsic protein gene and increases in abscisic acid and jasmonic acid in roots. Increased auxin and salicylic acid contributed to the compensated lateral root growth. In conclusion, root pruning improved WUE in maize by root water uptake.					孙, 晓茜/JLM-7573-2023; Chen, Yinglong/D-2104-2011	Chen, Yinglong/0000-0003-0798-8683													1664-462X					JAN 4	2023	13								1023088	10.3389/fpls.2022.1023088	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1023088								36684736					WOS:000913311600001

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) and rhizobium have substantial potential to improve plant growth and plant tolerance to metal stress. We evaluated the effects of co-inoculation with a PGPR strain (Paenibacillus mucilaginosus) and a Cu-resistant rhizobium strain (Sinorhizobium meliloti) on the efficiency of biodegradable chelant (S,S-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid; EDDS) assisted phytoremediation of a Cu contaminated soil using alfalfa. The highest total Cu extraction by alfalfa was observed in the EDDS-treated soil upon co-inoculation with the PGPR and rhizobium strains, which was 1.2 times higher than that without co-inoculation. Partial least squares path modeling identified plant oxidative damage and soil microbial biomass as the key variables influencing Cu uptake by alfalfa roots. Co-inoculation significantly reduced the oxidative damage to alfalfa by mitigating the accumulation of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species, and improving the antioxidation capacity of the plant in the presence of EDDS. EDDS application decreased microbial diversity in the rhizosphere, whereas co-inoculation increased microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and microbial community diversity. Increased relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Bacillus and the presence of Firmicutes taxa as potential biomarkers demonstrated that co-inoculation increased soil nutrient content, and improved plant growth. Co-inoculation with PGPR and rhizobium can be useful for altering plant-soil biochemical responses during EDDS-enhanced phytoremediation to alleviate phytotoxicity of heavy metals and improve soil biochemical activities. This study provides an effective strategy for improving phytoremediation efficiency and soil quality during chelant assisted phytoremediation of metal-contaminated soils. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their functions in spathe coloration are poorly known. Anthurium andraeanum is a popular ornamental plant with various spathe colors. In this study, small RNA and degradome libraries from three A. andraeanum cultivars with different-colored spathes were constructed and sequenced. Illumina sequencing resulted in 94 conserved miRNAs, and 34 novel miRNAs in total were then identified based on precursor sequences and hairpin structures. Differential expression analysis showed that 52, 51, and 49 miRNAs were differentially expressed in comparisons of orange- versus white-colored spathe, purple- versus white-colored spathe, and purple- versus orange-colored spathe, respectively. The expression patterns of miRNAs and their corresponding targets involved in spathe coloration were further analyzed, and displayed that miR156b and miR529 were highly abundant in the spathes with higher anthocyanin content. These two miRNAs co-targeted a gene encoding SPL17, which may function as a negative regulator in anthocyanin accumulation. In addition, miR408 was also abundantly expressed in purple- and orange-colored spathes, and its typical targets were also identified. This comprehensive integrated analysis provides insight into the miRNA-mediated genetic regulation in spathe coloration of A. andraeanum.					li, jiaxin/JNT-5073-2023	Chen, Shi-Peng/0000-0003-1192-6258; Kuo, Yun-Wei/0000-0003-3115-9850													0918-9440	1618-0860				JUL	2022	135	4			SI		609	626		10.1007/s10265-022-01394-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-022-01394-9		MAY 2022						35534649					WOS:000792559700002

This study was performed to investigate the temporal variations in soil erodibility indicators under different vegetation-restored gully slope lands on the Loess Plateau of China. Soil erodibility indicators included the K factor, mean weight diameter (MWD), mean number of drop impacts (MND), saturated conductivity (K-s), cohesion (Coh), penetration resistance (PR), and one comprehensive soil erodibility index (CSEI). One slope cropland (as the control) and seven vegetation-restored gully slope lands were selected to measure soil erodibility indicators for seven times from April 23 to October 10, 2018. Near soil-surface characteristics were also measured to explain the temporal variations in soil erodibility indicators. The results showed that the temporal variations in soil erodibility indicators of different vegetation lands were similar. The K factor fluctuated considerably, while the MWD, MND, K-s, Coh, and PR gradually increased over time. However, all erodibility indicators of the control cropland fluctuated over time with no distinctive trend. The CSEI of all sites fluctuated significantly over time. Compared to the control cropland, the mean K factors of different vegetation lands decreased by 2%-24%, but the mean values of MWD, MND, K-s, Coh, and PR increased by 108%-217%, 152%-343%, 94%-306%, 73%-175%, and 30%-199%, respectively. Consequently, the mean CSEI of different vegetation lands was reduced by 41% to 86%. The temporal variations in soil erodibility indicators were closely related to the seasonal changes in root mass density. Bothriochloa ischaemum (Linn.) Keng was considered the most effective restoration community to reduce soil erodibility of steep gully slope lands. The results contribute to improving the eco-environment on the Chinese Loess Plateau.						zhang, guanghui/0000-0002-3801-8439													0167-8809	1873-2305				DEC 1	2019	286								106661	10.1016/j.agee.2019.106661	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.106661													WOS:000500215400015

Don is the most widely planted exotic species in Australia, Chile, New Zealand and Spain. In this study, growth and survival of P. radiata were compared in 30 open pollinated families grown under two contrasting watering regimes in nursery (well-watered cf. water-stress conditions) and planted on a drought-prone site with Mediterranean climate in central Chile. This study assessed phenotypic plasticity in growth and survival at nursery stage and two years after establishment in the field. Family plasticity at nursery stage was estimated by the angular phenotypic change index (APCI), while the relationship between nursery and field traits was estimated by genetic correlations (r(g)) and the Pearson coefficient of correlation (r(xy)). Families presented high plasticity in diameter, height, and survival at nursery stage. Out of 30 families, eight exhibited over 80 % survival in the well-watered treatment, but less than 20 % survival in the water-stress treatment. As expected, growth traits and survival were positively correlated (r(g) and r(xy) > 0.65) between both nursery environments. However, for growth, most genetic and phenotypic correlations between combinations of nursery treatments versus the field test were negative or not significant. As there was no detectable pattern of nursery-field correlations regarding to combinations of nursery treatments and test site, the need to include more stable families and genotypes to an appropriate developmental stage at nursery is discussed.

Results indicated that accumulation of K+ content decreased but, Na+ content increased with increasing salt stress. SA-treated plants had more K+ and less Na+ content compared with the non-SA treated plants. Application of SA, especially with 1 mM, increased the I-P step of the OJIP transient curve of fluorescence. Salt stress decreased g(s), CCI, F-V, F-M, S-M and PIabs in plants. However, the time taken to reach FM (TFM) increased with increasing salt stress. Application of different concentrations of SA significantly improved gs, CCI, FV, SM, and PIabs of plants. Photosynthetic efficiency of plants improved as a result of SA application via decreasing F-o and increasing F-V/F-M, F-V/F-O, S-M/T-FM and Area under both saline and non-saline conditions. Accumulation of Na+ had negative, but K+ had a positive correlation with gs, CCI and most of the chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters (except, Fo and TFM). A positive correlation was found between g(s) and CCI with PIabs. This research indicated that low gs under saline condition seems to cause losses in PSII efficiency, but the application of SA with 1 mM concentration is the best treatment for the alleviation of salt stress injuries on PSII activity of mung bean plants.

To solve this problem, this study proposes a novel, multi-feature, patch-based apple image segmentation technique using the gray-centered red-green-blue (RGB) color space. The developed method presents a multi-feature selection process, which eliminates the effect of halation and shadows in apple images. By exploring all the features of the image, including halation and shadows, in the gray-centered RGB color space, the proposed algorithm, which is a generalization of K-means clustering algorithm, provides an efficient target segmentation result. The proposed method is tested on 240 apple images. It offered an average accuracy rate of 98.79%, a recall rate of 99.91%, an F1 measure of 99.35%, a false positive rate of 0.04%, and a false negative rate of 1.18%. Compared with the classical segmentation methods and conventional clustering algorithms, as well as the popular deep-learning segmentation algorithms, the proposed method can perform with high efficiency and accuracy to guide robotic harvesting.

A comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the effects of R. pseudoacacia afforestation on ecosystems and striking a balance between ecosystem safety and functioning and R. pseudoacacia naturalization arc crucially important. To achieve these goals, studying the community functional structure of R. pseudoacacia plantations is an essential prerequisite that remains understudied,Through quantifying and comparing the functional structure of R. pseudoacacia plantations and naturally restored communities i-elating to soil erosion control and plant ecology strategies along a 10-40-year chronosequence on the hilly and gullied Loess Plateau, China, we assessed the effects of R. p.seudoacacia afforestation on plant community structure from a functional perspective. We found significant differences among restoration strategies in all the functional composition indices but only functional divergence (FDiv) indices, suggesting that the afforestation practice had a great impact on functional composition but not on functional diversity. Specifically, the plantations had relatively high community weighted means (CWMs) of specific leaf area (SLA), plant height (PH), seed production, seed mass, root mean diameter, clonality and resprouting capacity and high FDivs of the leaf-height-seed scheme and persistence partially suggesting that the exotic tree could naturalize and coexist with native plants in the study area. Moreover, the relatively high CWMs of woodiness, PH and SLA and high FDiv of erosion-control-related traits found in the plantations indicate that the plantations might have superiority in soil erosion control. R. pseudoacacia also had a homogenization effect on understory functional composition and divergence. Furthermore, we proposed a trait-based effect-and-response framework to find the balance, thus achieving sustainable coexistence of the exotic species with ecosystems. This study may provide new prospects for management practices of R. pseudoacacia plantations and a robust scaffold to maintain safe, resilient and functioning ecosystems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

J	Fang, FR; Han, XY; Liu, WZ; Tang, M				Fang, Fengru; Han, Xiaoyang; Liu, Wenzhao; Tang, Ming			Carbon dioxide fluxes in a farmland ecosystem of the southern Chinese Loess Plateau measured using a chamber-based method	PEERJ												Background. Farmland accounts for a relatively large fraction of the world's vegetation cover, and the quantification of carbon fluxes over farmland is critical for understanding regional carbon budgets. The carbon cycle of farmland ecosystems has become a focus of global research in the field of carbon dynamics and cycling. The objectives of this study are to monitor the temporal variation in the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and soil respiration in a spring maize (Zea mays L.) farmland ecosystem of the southern Loess Plateau of China. Methods. A fully automated temperature-controlled flux chamber system was adopted in this study. The system contained nine chambers for CO2 flux measurements, and three treatments were conducted: with and without maize plants in the chamber, as well as a bare field. Observations were conducted from June to September 2011. This time period covers the seedling, jointing, heading, grain filling, and ripening stages of spring maize. Other factors, such as air temperature (Ta), soil temperature (Ts), soil water content (SWC), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and precipitation (P), were simultaneously monitored. Results. There was observed diurnal variation in the NEE of the maize ecosystem (NEE-maize). A short "noon break" occurred when the PAR intensity was at its maximum, while soil respiration rates had curves with a single peak. During the overall maize growth season, the total NEE-maize was -68.61 g C m(-2), and the soil respiration from the maize field (SR-maize) and bare field (SR-bare field) were 245.69 g C m(-2) and 114.08 g C m(-2), respectively. The temperature sensitivity of soil respiration in the maize field exceeded that in the bare field. Significant negative correlations were found between the NEE, PAR, and temperature (all p-values < 0.01), with both Ta and PAR being the primary factors that affected the CO2 fluxes, collectively contributing 61.7%, 37.2%, and 56.8% to the NEE-maize, SR-maize, and SR-bare field, respectively. It was therefore concluded that both meteorological factors and farming practices have an important impact on the carbon balance process in corn farmland ecosystems. However, it is necessary to conduct long-term observational studies, in order to get a better understanding of the driving mechanism.

The south-, northwest-, and north-facing slopes were selected to investigate the influence of slope aspect on the concentrations, storage, and allocation of macro- and micronutrients in Artemisia sacrorum on the Loess Plateau in China. The concentrations of available manganese (Mn) in both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils reached their maximum on the north-facing slope. The concentrations of available iron (Fe) in rhizosphere soil and available copper (Cu) in non-rhizosphere soil reached their maximum on the south-facing slope. Slope aspect significantly affected the total concentrations of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), Cu, and Mn in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils, and all of these elements reached their maximum on the northwest-facing slope. Slope aspect significantly influenced the concentrations of aboveground K, Ca, and Mg, sodium (Na), Mn, and belowground K in A. sacrorum, and the concentrations of aboveground K, Ca, Mg, and Na and belowground Mn, Na, Fe, Ca, and Mg in weed. Most elements in A. sacrorum and the weeds reached their maximum on the south-facing slope. Slope aspect significantly changed the aboveground-to-belowground concentration ratios of K, Ca, and Na in A. sacrorum and weed. Slope aspect significantly affected the storage of macro- and micronutrients in A. sacrorum and weed but not the storage in the plants of the entire plot. Slope aspect predominantly affected the storage allocation of macro- and micronutrients in A. sacrorum but not those in weed. Slope aspect is an important topographic factor that affects the macro- and micronutrients in plants and soil in micro-ecosystem environments.

The aim of this study was to perform the calibration and sensitivity analyses of the OpenLISEM model for an unpaved rural road in Southern Brazil, where the quantitative understanding of the impact of precipitation on water and soil loss is limited, and the improvement of the use of the method is crucial for determination of the hydrosedimentological dynamic. Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients (NSE) were used to compare measured and simulated data series of discharge and sediment production. "One-factor-at-a-time" (OAT) and relative sensitivity coefficients were derived relative to changes of total discharge (Q), average soil loss (Q(s)), infiltration (I), runoff erosion (E-r), splash erosion (E-s), and deposition (D) against relative changes of the Manning coefficient (n), random roughness (rr), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), suction at the wetting front (psi(soil)), aggregate stability (aggrstab), soil cohesion (coh), mean aggregate diameter (d50), and initial soil moisture content (theta(i)). The model calibration produced NSE coefficients of 0.97 and 0.90 for discharge and sediment production data series, respectively. Q and Q(s) were mostly sensitive to random roughness and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Our results also showed the high relevance of Ksat for I, and aggrstab for D and E-s. The sensitivity analysis of the model revealed significant variations of sensitivity, depending on the magnitude of the values adopted in the calibration and the used methodology.

However, there are few analyses on the connection between check dams and the downstream channel and the impact on structural connectivity and sediment interception efficiency. Based on a field survey, this study classified the connection mode between check dams and the downstream channel, and the actual control area percentage by discharge canal in dam land was used to quantitatively evaluate the degree of the structural connectivity of sediment between the check dam and the downstream channel. The analysis results show that the connection mode can be divided into eleven categories with different structural connectivity. The different connection modes and its combination mode of check dams and downstream channels in dam systems have a large difference, and the structural connectivity of the dam system is less than or equal to that of the sum of single check dams in a watershed. The degree of structural connectivity of a dam system will be greatly reduced if there is a main control check dam with no discharge canal in the lower reaches of the watershed. Compared with a single check dam, the structural connectivity of a dam system is reduced by 0-42.38%, with an average of 11.18%. According to the difference in connection mode and structural connectivity of check dams and dam systems in the four typical small watersheds, the optimization methods for connection mode in series, parallel and hybrid dam systems were proposed. The research results can provide a reference for the impact of a check dam on the sediment connectivity and the sediment interception efficiency in a watershed and can also guide the layout of a dam system and the arrangement of drainage facilities.y					Wang, Nan/HLV-7836-2023; Wang, Nan/JLL-3980-2023; Bai, Leichao/AHI-2669-2022	Bai, Leichao/0000-0002-5471-8013														2073-4441				OCT	2021	13	19							2644	10.3390/w13192644	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13192644													WOS:000707036700001

Typical restoration types, including orchardland, grassland, shrubland, and forestland, were chosen to examine changes in the stocks and stoichiometry of SOC, soil total nitrogen (TN), and soil total phosphorus (TP) at different soil depths and recovery times. Results showed that SOC stocks first increased and then stabilized in orchardland, grassland, and shrubland at 0-30 cm depths, while in forestland, SOC stocks gradually increased. Soil TN stocks first increased and then decreased in orchardland, shrubland, and forestland with restoration age at 0-30 cm depths, while soil TP stocks showed little variation between restoration types; at the same time, the overall C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios increased with restoration age. In the later stages of restoration, the stocks of SOC and soil TN at 0-30 cm soil depths were still lower than those in natural grassland and natural forest. Additionally, the SOC, soil TN, and soil TP stocks and the C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios decreased with soil depth. The forestland had the highest rate of change in SOC and soil TN stocks, at 0-10 cm soil depth. These results indicate a complex response of SOC, soil TN, and soil TP stocks and stoichiometry to vegetation restoration, which could have important implications for understanding C, N, and P changes and nutrient limitations after vegetation restoration.

Constraints in dry chilli cultivation practices and mechanization of harvesting in Southern India	JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCES												Dry chilli production in India condition faces many challenges apart from adverse weather conditions, labor-intensive production practices and higher overall production costs are limiting profitable dry chilli cultivation. Therefore, a study was carried to know the key constraints in current chilli production practices in eight major production districts of three states. A systematic research and development approach is essential to know the range of constraints and farmers preferences over technological options for field operations. The harvesting operation alone demands 43% of labour 360.5 man-days/ha. So, red chilli harvesting mechanization is a definite immediate requirement to reduce labour input. Farmers (47%) prefer small size self-propelled chilli harvester over tractor operated equipment. In the production catchments, farmer also inferred to change the cultivation practices to mechanize chilli production operations, but 18% of farmers hesitant to adopt one-time-harvesting chilli varieties due to suspicion about the yield potentials.

The water balance equation, double mass curve, and linear regression analysis were employed to quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff and sediment discharge reductions in the Jialing River during 1960-2017. The results indicated that the annual runoff of the Jialing River exhibited a significant decreasing trend of - 2.75 x 10(8) m(3) every year (P < 0.05) but no significant abrupt change occurred, while annual sediment discharge significantly decreased by 0.03 x 10(8) t every year (P < 0.05) with a significant abrupt change in 1990 (P < 0.05). Climate change led to a great reduction (82.2%) in annual runoff from 1960 to 2017 in the Jialing River, whereas the contribution of climate change to sediment discharge reduction in the human-affected period (1990-2017) was only 4.55% and precipitation inclined to increase sediment discharge in recent years (2010-2017). The reduced sediment discharge in the 1990s was mostly due to the implementation of soil-water conservation programs and the reduction after 2000 was due to the development of reservoirs as well as the implementation of soil-water conservation programs. The results provided references to develop various human activities better and drew great attention to strengthening basin management.

However, the dynamics of soil water and nitrogen due to changes in tillage and surface residue cover can be difficult to characterize due to limitations in field experimentation. The objective of this study was to quantify the differences in the soil water and nitrogen balance in the 0-100 cm soil profile, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield, water productivity (WP) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) that occur when conventional tillage (CT) was changed to four types of conservation tillage treatments (no-tillage [NT], subsoiling tillage [ST], no-tillage with straw [NS] and subsoiling tillage with straw [SS]). Experimental data from 2011 to 2016 collected in Henan province, China on a sandy loam soil was used to calibrate and validate the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2). Then the model was used to simulate four tillage systems (NT, NS, ST, SS) that were then compared with CT. The agreement index (d) between simulated and measured soil water content, soil nitrate concentration, and grain yield ranged between 0.71 and 0.93. The root means square error (RMSE) of the soil water content and nitrate concentration was in the range 0.02-0.03 cm cm(-l) and 5.5-10.3 mg kg(-1), respectively. When CT was converted to NT from 2011 to 2016, the model simulated a 9.1 % reduction in annual water loss and a 55.6 % decrease in nitrogen leaching loss and simulated significant increase in average grain yield, WP and NUE. Replacing CT with NT appears to be the best of the four alternative conservation tillage conversion strategies in Henan Province of China.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				MAR 1	2020	230								105956	10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105956	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105956													WOS:000525283000012
J	Niu, XT; Fan, J; Xing, YZ				Niu, Xiaotao; Fan, Jun; Xing, Yuzhu			Stemflow temporal dynamics differ significantly between standing live and dead branches of two xerophytic shrub species	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Shrub mortality due to self-thinning and climate change is a natural consequence of the long residence times of standing dead branches in unmanaged shrub plantations. Stemflow (SF) represents a key point source of input water and nutrients into the soil in shrub ecosystems. However, little information is available about how shrub mortality affects SF variables. In this study, we measured the SF volume (SFV), funneling ratio (FR), SF intensity, time lag to rain, and rainfall characteristics for live and standing dead branches of two major shrub species comprising Caragana korshinskii and Salix psammophila during the rainy season in 2022 on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The results demonstrated that the SF variables and temporal dynamic processes differed between standing live and dead branches of the two shrubs. For C. korshinskii, the mean SFV and FR were 1.9 and 1.8 times higher for live branches than dead branches, respectively, whereas for S. psammophila, the mean SFV and FR were 1.3 and 1.6 times higher for dead branches than live branches. These contradictory results can be explained by differences in the canopy structures of the species, such as the surface area that contributes to the generation of SF in the upper canopy, branch angles, and the degree of branch bark decomposition and decay. In addition, the SF variables were significantly temporally dependent on the rainfall characteristics. SFV, SFI, and SFD were positively and linearly correlated with the rainfall amount, intensity, and duration at the inter-event scale (P < 0.001). The influence of rainfall intensity on SF time lag to rain were not significant at the intra-event scale (P > 0.05). Considering the enrichment ratio due to canopy dry deposition and bark decomposition, the periodic flattening of dead S. psammophila branches to restore their growth is less significant than allowing them to die and renew naturally. These findings may serve as a reference for developing management practices for shrub species in areas with soil water and nutrient deficiencies.

However, the dynamics of microbial P functional genes and the underlying regulatory mechanisms in different forest biomes (e.g., temperate vs. subtropical) have yet to be sufficiently clarified. In this study, we applied a metagenomics approach to investigate changes in the abundance of three microbial P functional gene groups (P starvation response regulation genes, P uptake and transport genes, and P solubilization and mineralization genes) along a subtropical-temperate gradient of forest biomes (23 degrees N-45 degrees N) in China. Our results revealed that the abundances of P starvation response regulation genes in temperate forest biomes were significantly higher than those in the subtropics (p < 0.05), although not in the cases of the other two P functional gene types (p > 0.05). Moreover, in both temperate and subtropical forests, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were identified as key phyla associated with P cycling; moreover, we found dominate species of Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria at genus level were higher in subtropical zones than that of temperate zones, in most cases. Furthermore, our results showed that significant correlation was found between P functional genes and microbial alpha-diversity along latitude gradient. Furthermore, in both forest biomes, microbial community alpha-diversity was significantly positively correlated with P starvation response regulation genes (p < 0.05), whereas alpha-diversity was significantly positively related to P uptake and transport genes in temperate forest biomes (p < 0.001), although not in subtropical forests (p > 0.05). In addition, we found that whereas soil substrates showed significant negative relationships with P solubilization and mineralization genes in temperate forest biomes (p < 0.05), this was not the case in subtropical forests. Collectively, these findings indicate that the responses of microbial P functional genes to the environmental variation in temperate forests are more sensitive than those in subtropical forests, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for further elucidation of the differential regulatory roles of these genes in different forest biomes.

Four novel candidate transcription factor genes were verified using qRT-PCR. Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plants that determines crop yield. Improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) should considerably increase wheat yield and reduce the use of nitrogen fertilisers. However, knowledge on the genetic basis of NUE during wheat maturity is limited. In this study, a diversity panel incorporating 389 wheat accessions was phenotyped for eight NUE-related agronomic traits across five different environments. A total of 347 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for low nitrogen tolerance indices (ratio of agronomic characters under low and high nitrogen conditions) were identified through a genome-wide association study utilising 397,384 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MLM (Q + K) model, including 11 stable QTLs. Furthermore, 69 candidate genes were predicted for low nitrogen tolerance indices of best linear unbiased predictions values of the eight studied agronomic traits, and four novel candidate transcription factors (TraesCS5A02G237500 for qFsnR5A.2, TraesCS5B02G384500 and TraesCS5B02G384600 for qSLR5B.1, and TraesCS3B02G068800 for qTKWR3B.1) showed differing expression patterns in contrasting low-nitrogen-tolerant wheat genotypes. Moreover, the number of favourable marker alleles calculated using NUE that were significantly related to SNP in accessions decreased over the decades, indicating a decline in the NUE of the 389 wheat varieties. These findings denote promising NUE markers that could be useful in breeding high-NUE wheat varieties, and the candidate genes could further detail the NUE-related regulation network in wheat.

Accurate estimation of savanna evapotranspiration (ET) is vital for understanding the regional and global water balance and its feedback to climate. However, the overlapping phenology and different water-use patterns of trees and grasses constitute a major challenge for modeling efforts. To estimate savanna ET, we used a three-source ET model, partitioning ET among soil, trees, and grasses. To represent legacy effects of precipitation on ecosystem water use, the Normalized Ecosystem Drought Index (NEDI, i.e. a function of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) was included to limit canopy conductances in the model and also in two other classic two-layer models (Shuttleworth-Wallace model and Penman-Monteith-Leuning model). The results of our model and the other models were tested and compared using tower-based eddy covariance flux data collected at six sites (including four savanna sites, one pasture site, and one grassland site) along a precipitation gradient in northern Australia, together with satellite-derived leaf area index, which was partitioned to represent the canopy dynamics of trees and grasses. Inclusion of NEDI significantly reduced seasonal biases in ET estimation results for all models compared with observations at savanna sites (fitted slopes were closer to unity by 0.08-0.10, R-2 increased by 0.03-0.04, and RMSE decreased by 0.07-0.09 mm d(-1)). The three-source model provides insights into simulation of water fluxes over vegetated areas of complex composition. Our work makes a contribution to savanna research by determining a flexible indicator defining the seasonal water availability limitation on savanna ET. The inclusion of NEDI in ET models could guide future research on modeling ecosystem water and carbon fluxes in response to seasonal droughts.

Moreover, we pay more attention to deriving the adsorption mechanisms and exploring the difference in adsorption characteristics of Pb2+ and Cd2+. The optimal preparation conditions and the batch adsorption experiments were evaluated, and the adsorption characteristics and mechanisms were discussed using 8 theoretical adsorption models and multiple characterisation methods. The results showed that the CB prepared at 650 degrees C for 3 h presented the best performance. The Langmuir and Freundlich models can well simulate the isotherm adsorption process of CB for Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively. The adsorption kinetics of CB for Pb2+ and Cd2+ were best fitted by the pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption equilibrium for Pb2+ and Cd2+ was reached within 3 h, and their maximum adsorption capacity reached 220.94 mg g(-1) and 42.43 mg g(-1), respectively. In addition, the best addition amount was 3 g L-1 and 2.2 g L-1 for Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively. The optimum pH range was 3-6 for Pb2+ and 6-7.5 for Cd2+. The adsorption mechanisms of CB for Pb2+ and Cd2+ were physicochemical composite adsorption processes, mainly including physical sorption on surface sites, intraparticle diffusion, electrostatic adsorption, ion/ligand exchange, cationic-pi interactions, surface complexation and precipitation. Furthermore, the ash of CB also presented a positive effect on the adsorption of Pb2+. Compared with other cellulose- and lignin-based biomass materials, CB showed low cost and efficient performance without complicated modification conditions. Therefore, this study demonstrates that CB is a promising raw material in water pollution control to immobilise heavy metals.

Diffuse layer model (DLM) fitting and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis indicated that the hydroxyl group played a key role in Pb(II) sorption onto composites by masking reactive sites, such as carboxyl and phosphoryl groups of bacterial cells. Negative enthalpy (from -39.29 to -57.87 kJ mol(-1)) and positive entropy (from 135.61 to 193.47 kJ mol(-1)) of Pb(II) sorption onto composites revealed that inner-sphere complexes formed through exothermic reactions and was driven by both entropy and enthalpy. Spatial distribution of these inner-sphere species at varied Pb(II) loading demonstrated that interactions between Pb(II) and bacterial cells preceded that of mineral components in composites, using microfocus X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (mu-XRF) maps and microfocus X-ray absorption near edge structure (mu-XANES) spectra. Combined with bulk Pb L-m-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectrum, we inferred that mononuclear bidentate edge-sharing hydroxyl-Pb complexes, monodentate mononuclear carboxyl-Pb and phosphoryl-Pb complexes predominantly contributed to Pb(II) inner-sphere binding with mineral and bacterial fractions in composites, respectively. The molecular binding mechanisms obtained in this study provide further insight into the sequestration and migration of toxic metals in natural environments.

Nevertheless, previous studies have inadequately assessed the respective contributions of climate variability and human activities to runoff change on different spatial scales. Using Mann-Kendall and Pettitt's methods, this study identified long-term (1970-2018) changes in hydro-meteorological variables. Furthermore, the Budyko-based method was used to quantify the influence of climate change and human activities on runoff change at different spatial scales of the WRB, including the whole WRB, three sub-basins, and sixteen catchments. The results show that a significant decrease trend was identified in runoff at different spatial scales within the WRB. Runoff in almost all catchments showed a significant downward trend. Temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and the parameter n showed significant increases, whereas no significant trend in precipitation was observed. The change in runoff was mainly concentrated in the mid-1990s and early 2000s. Anthropogenic activities produced a larger impact on runoff decrease in the WRB (62.8%), three sub-basins (53.9% to 65.8%), and most catchments (-47.0% to 147.3%) than climate change. Dramatic catchment characteristic changes caused by large-scale human activities were the predominant reason of runoff reduction in the WRB. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the dominate factors causing runoff change and contribute to water resource management and ecosystem health conservation in the WRB.

This study aimed to determine how restoration age and latitude affect soil erodibility and the multifractal dimensions of PSD during natural recovery. We collected soil samples from grassland, shrubland, and forests with different restoration ages in the steppe zone (SZ), forest-steppe zone (FSZ), and forest zone (FZ). Various analyses were conducted on the samples, including multifractal analysis and erodibility analysis. Our results showed that restoration age had no significant effect on the multifractal dimensions of PSD (capacity dimension (D0), information dimension (D1), information dimension/capacity dimension ratio (D1/D0), correlation dimension (D2)), and soil erodibility. Multifractal dimensions tended to increase, while soil erodibility tended to decrease, with restoration age. Latitude was negatively correlated with fractal dimensions (D0, D2) and positively correlated with K and D1/D0. During vegetation restoration, restoration age, precipitation, and temperature affect the development of vegetation, resulting in differences in soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, soil texture, and soil enzyme activity, and by affecting soil structure to change the soil stability. This study revealed the impact of restoration age and latitude on soil erosion in the Loess Plateau.

Based on the GIMMS NDVI3g and MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, the temporal and spatial characteristics of vegetation changes in the UWNR from 1982 to 2020 were analyzed by a Theil-Sen median trend analysis and Mann-Kendall test. The future trend of vegetation was analyzed by the Hurst exponential method. A partial correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship of the vegetation and climate factors, and a residual trend analysis was used to quantify the influence of climate change and human activities on vegetation change. The results indicated that the average NDVI value (0.75) of the UWNR from 1982 to 2020 was relatively high. The average coefficient of variation for the NDVI was 0.059, and the vegetation change was relatively stable. The vegetation in the UWNR increased 0.013/10 year on average, but the vegetation degradation in some areas was serious and mainly classified as agricultural land. The results of a future trend analysis showed that the vegetation in the UWNR is mainly negatively sustainable, and 62.54% of the vegetation will degrade in the future. The NDVI of the UWNR was more affected by temperature than by precipitation, especially on agricultural land and forestland, which were more negatively affected by warming. Climate change and human activities have an impact on vegetation changes, but the spatial distributions of the effects differ. The relative impact of human activities on vegetation change accounted for 64.5%, which was higher than that of climate change (35.5%). Human activities, such as the large proportion of agriculture, rapid population growth and the rapid development of urbanization were the main driving forces. Establishing a cross-border drought joint early warning mechanism, strengthening basic agricultural research, and changing traditional agricultural farming patterns may be effective measures to address food security and climate change and improve vegetation in the UWNR.					shanshan, Wang/D-4444-2012; Li, Hao/GPS-9834-2022; Li, Li/IAQ-0885-2023	shanshan, Wang/0000-0002-6922-1640; 														2072-4292				SEP	2021	13	18							3648	10.3390/rs13183648	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13183648													WOS:000699839300001

In this area, long-term rotary tillage in winter wheat and no tillage in summer maize have significantly increased soil bulk density, which impede maize root growth and reduce the grain yield. Subsoiling tillage is an effective practice to improve soil properties and crop growth. The objective of this study was to investigate the integrated effects of subsoiling tillage in both winter wheat and summer maize seasons on soil bulk density, maize root growth and spatial distribution. A two-year field experiment was conducted in winter wheat-summer maize rotation system. Tillage treatments included rotary tillage (RT) and subsoiling tillage (ST) in wheat season, and no tillage (NT), inter-row subsoiling tillage (STIR), and on-row subsoiling tillage (STOR) in maize season. It was found that in the second year, i.e., in 2018, ST decreased soil bulk density by 3.87% and increased porosity by 5.86% at 30-40 cm soil depth at maize maturity. Meanwhile, maize root length density at 40-50 cm depth increased by 30.00% and grain yield increased by 4.70% under ST. In maize season tillage treatments, STOR decreased soil bulk density by 4.52% and increased soil porosity by 6.96% at 20-30 cm soil depth. Compared with NT, the STOR significantly increased maize root length density at 20-30 cm soil depth by 78.45%, and increased root length density in a horizontal area 0-10 cm for both years, with a significant increase of 58.89% in 2018. Therefore, this study demonstrated that in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, which has a tidal soil type, subsoiling tillage in winter wheat season and on-row subsoiling tillage in maize season can loosen the soil and improve vertical extension of maize root system in the soil.					chen, yanhong/JVE-0289-2024; yang, xiao/JLL-7721-2023	Sun, Qing/0000-0001-6367-5628; zhao, zixuan/0009-0004-7004-2908; Zhang, Peiyu/0009-0002-2323-059X; Xue, Qingwu/0000-0002-6470-3245														2073-4395				FEB	2023	13	2							394	10.3390/agronomy13020394	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13020394													WOS:000937920500001

Our previous work showed that the rotational strip intercropping of maize (Zea mays L.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) (RMP) improved crop productivity in comparison with the continuous monoculture of maize (CM) or peanut (CP). However, the effects of RMP on crop physiology and soil properties related to the productivity remain unclear. Methods: Crop productivity and physiology, soil nutrients, and bacterial communities under RMP were evaluated over six years and compared with CP and CM. Results: RMP significantly increased the crop productivity, with an average land equivalent ratio (LER) of 1.19. RMP increased maize yield by 16.01-21.68% compared with CM, with a partial land equivalent ratio (PLER) of 0.58-0.61. The maize physiological properties were markedly improved as indicated by the increased dry matter (DW) accumulation of the stem, soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD) value, and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) under RMP. The contents of soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium and total nitrogen were increased after peanut rotation. Microbial community structures were significantly affected by the soil layer and planting modes, and both microbial richness and diversity were significantly reduced in CP compared with RMP. Sphingomonas and Gemmatimonas were the dominant genera in the 0-20 cm soil layer and their abundance was positively correlated with the contents of TP and AP. Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, a genus that can break down autotoxins resulting from continuous cropping of peanuts and prevent infection, was the dominant and indicator genus in the 20-40 cm soil layer where direct belowground interaction of maize and peanuts occurs under RMP. Conclusions: In conclusion, increased productivity in RMP was largely the result of higher photosynthetic production of maize, caused by aboveground interspecific competitive advantage, and the optimization of soil nutrient composition and bacterial communities for peanut, caused by belowground interspecific interactions. Implications or significance: This study suggested that plant-soil-microbe interactions are key to the high productivity observed in RMP and should be considered in designing cropping systems for sustainable agriculture.

Therefore, different combinations of annual crops with perennial fruit trees were assessed to restore the soil carbon, and enhance farm productivity and prof-itability in a semi-arid climate. The study hypothesized that the integration of perennial fruit trees with seasonal crops may enhance farm productivity, economic returns, and environmental sustainability. Integration of phalsa (Grewia asiatica) with mung bean (Vigna radiata) -potato (Solanum tuberosum) sys-tem recorded the highest system productivity (25.9 Mg/ha) followed by phalsa with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata)-mustard (Brassica juncea) systems (21.2 Mg/ha). However, Karonda (Carissa sp.) with mung bean -potato system recorded maximum net return (3529.1 US$/ha), and water use efficiency (33.0 kg/ha-mm). Concerning the benefit-cost (B:C) ratio, among the agroforestry systems, the karonda + cowpea -mustard system registered a maximum BC ratio (3.85). However, SOC density remained higher (9.10 Mg/ha) under the phalsa + cowpea -mustard and Moringa + mung bean -potato system (9.16 Mg/ha) over other systems. Similarly, phalsa + mung bean -potato system had the highest C sustainability index (27.6), carbon sequestration potential (0.6-0.67 Mg/ha/year), and water use effi-ciency (33.0 kg/ha-mm). Hence, the study suggested that the integration of short-duration leguminous and oilseeds with fruit trees offer a myriad of benefits and an efficient system for restoring the soil C without compromising the food and livelihood security of the rural populace in semiarid regions.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

The CT32 strain was isolated from maize straw compost tea and identified as B. velezensis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Bioassays conducted in sealed plates revealed that the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the strain CT32 possessed broad-spectrum antifungal activity against eight phytopathogenic fungi. The volatile profile of strain CT32 was obtained by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A total of 30 volatile compounds were identified, six of which have not previously been detected in bacteria or fungi: (Z)-5-undecene, decyl formate, 2,4-dimethyl-6-tert-butylphenol, dodecanenitrile, 2-methylpentadecane and 2,2',5,5'-tetramethyl-1,1'-biphenyl. Pure compounds were tested in vitro for their inhibitory effect on the mycelial growth of V. dahliae and F. oxysporum. Decanal, benzothiazole, 3-undecanone, 2-undecanone, 2-undecanol, undecanal and 2,4-dimethyl-6-tert-butylphenol showed high antifungal activity, with benzothiazole and 2,4-dimethyl-6-tert-butylphenol being the most potent compounds. These results indicate that the VOCs produced by B. velezensis CT32 have the potential to be used as a biofumigant for management of vascular wilt pathogens.

Previous studies have described the independent effects of climatic factors, plant and soil nutrient status on nutrient resorption. However, little is known about the comprehensive effects of these factors on nutrient resorption, especially based on observations in situ.MethodsIn a semi-arid grassland of the Loess Plateau, China, we conducted an eight-year field survey and sampled leaves and soils separately in 2013, 2016, and 2020. We explored interannual variation in foliar nutrient resorption efficiency (NuRE, including nitrogen and phosphorus resorption efficiency, i.e., NRE and PRE) and the driving factors in graminoids and forbs.ResultsThe NuRE in graminoids varied significantly, but in forbs varied insignificantly among years, indicating a more flexible nutrient resorption strategy in graminoids. Further, climatic variables showed stronger effects on NuRE than soil nutrients. Specifically, growing-season temperature and precipitation controlled NuRE of graminoids and forbs by regulating green leaf N:P ratio ([N:P]g), while soil nutrients did not affect NuRE. The regulation of [N:P]g on NuRE was explained by foliar stoichiometric control in which N and P were resorbed proportionally with [N:P]g. Meanwhile, the positive relationships between NRE and PRE and between NRE:PRE and [N:P]g confirmed stoichiometric control on NuRE.ConclusionOur findings suggested that growing season hydro-thermal factors affected the interannual variations of NuRE through a foliar stoichiometric control strategy. Meanwhile, more NuRE plasticity and positive responses to climatic factors in graminoids (the dominant group here) could explain their dominance in this grassland.					; Guo, Liang/J-8876-2014	Liu, Xiaowei/0000-0001-9120-9544; Guo, Liang/0000-0002-1424-0596													0032-079X	1573-5036				2023 AUG 11	2023										10.1007/s11104-023-06214-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-023-06214-0		AUG 2023											WOS:001046036800002
J	Dai, JJ; Li, YY; Wang, L				Dai, Junjie; Li, Yangyang; Wang, Li			Mixed-species plantations alleviate deep soil water depletion and facilitate hydrological niche partitioning compared to pure plantations	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Understanding the effects of different silvicultural patterns on soil water reservoirs and how silvicultural species adjust their water use strategies and plant function traits is critical to guiding future silvicultural activities toward the sustainable development of plantations. We continuously monitored soil gravimetric water content (SWC), soil and plant isotopes, leaf water potentials at predawn and midday (psi pd and psi md), and plant morphological traits in pure Populus simonii tree plantations (PPs), pure Amorpha fruticose shrub plantations (PAf), and mixed P. simonii-A. fruticose plantations (Msf) during the 2021 growing season. The study showed that the average SWC of the deep layer (80-200 cm) was Msf > PAf > PPs. P. simonii in the Msf increased the water use proportion of the deep layer compared to that in the PPs, especially during the vigorous growth period of June-July, and shifted the major water use from shallow (0-40 cm) to deep layers on average. A. fruticose mainly used shallow soil water during the growing season. The leaf-level water use efficiency of the same species did not change in the Msf compared to that in the PPs or PAf. Based on the slope (sigma) of the linear equation of psi pd-psi md, P. simonii and A. fruticose exhibited isohydric (sigma < 1) and an-isohydric (sigma > 1) behavior under varying soil water conditions, respectively. The wood density was higher and specific leaf area (SLA) was lower in the PPs than in the Msf for P. simonii, while the ratio of stem sapwood area to leaf area was higher and SLA was lower in the PAf than in the Msf for A. fruticose. These findings reflected that mixed tree-shrub plantations alleviate deep soil water depletion compared to pure plantations, facilitate hydrological niche segmentation of co-occurring species, and reduce carbon investment in xylem and leaves to resist water stress and possibly devote more resources to growth.					戴, 军杰/GQP-3514-2022; Wang, Li/AAE-6919-2022	戴, 军杰/0000-0002-2487-084X; wang, li/0000-0002-2697-4802													0378-1127	1872-7042				JUL 1	2023	539								121017	10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121017		APR 2023											WOS:000983743700001

Studies at the agricultural watershed scale can satisfy both of these conditions, and to reduce the effects of soil heterogeneity due to differences in spatial scale, it is better to select different slopes in the same small watershed. To understand how soil properties will respond to the variation of slope position and cropland management at an agricultural watershed, we present the distribution of soil bulk density (BD), saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s), water-stable aggregates, soil organic carbon (OC), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) at four slope positions in two cropland management systems of a small agricultural watershed in the black soil region of northeast China. The selected four slope positions include upper slope, middle slope, lower slope, and footslope positions. The two cropland management systems consist of a sustainable cropland system (i.e., contour ridge tillage at upper slope position, longitudinal ridge tillage at middle slope and lower slope positions, and grassland at footslope position) and a conventional cropland system (i.e., contour ridge tillage at upper slope position, longitudinal ridge tillage at middle slope, lower slope positions, and foot-slope positions). The results showed that soil bulk density and microaggregates decreased but the concentration of OC and nutrients, K-s, and small-macroaggregate increased from the upper slope position to the lower slope position in both the conventional and sustainable croplands, which was due to the interaction effect of cultivation with erosion. In comparison with conventional cropland, sustainable cropland has greater K-s, large-macroaggregate, small-macroaggregate, microaggregate, and concentrations and stocks of OC, N, and P, but showed lower bulk density and silt + clay fraction. However, the prominent differences in both croplands were presented in the foot-slope position, which is ascribed to the interaction of cultivation, erosion, and cropland management. These results highlighted that sustainable cropland management practice has the potential to improve soil structure and prevent soil and nutrient loss.

To date, it is still difficult to assess the ecological function of biocrusts in different distribution patterns due to challenges in quantitatively assessing their patterns. Landscape ecology inspired us to characterize and describe landscape distribution patterns through a series of indices. Accordingly, this study developed a method to quantitatively characterize the distribution pattern of biocrusts at the plot scale. Our results demonstrated that optimum grain size selection is important. The first inflection point determines the optimum grain size of 5 mm. Based on this grain size, four landscape indices were selected out of fifteen, including the percentage of the landscape (PLAND), edge density (ED), patch cohesion index (COHESION), and splitting index (SPLIT), which represented 91.6 % of the total distribution characteristic information of biocrusts within 58 squares of 1.5 x 1.5 m. The four landscape indices were validated for applicability by describing biocrust characteristics for various patterns, scales, and coverage levels both in the laboratory and field plots. This method for quantitatively assessing the distribution characteristics of biocrusts lays a foundation for the study of the relationship between the distribution pattern of biocrusts and ecological functions and processes.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				JAN 1	2022	429								116257	10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.116257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.116257													WOS:000898489200001

SIF originates from the light reactions of photosynthesis, whereas carbon fixation takes place during the dark reactions of photosynthesis. Questions remain regarding whether SIF is able to track changes in the efficiency of the dark reactions in photosynthesis. Using concurrent measurements of leaf-scale gas exchange, pulse amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorescence, and fluorescence spectral radiances, we found that both far-red fluorescence radiances and PAM fluorescence yields responded rapidly to changes in photosynthetic carbon assimilation due to changes in environmental factors or induced stomatal closure under constant light conditions. Uncertainties in outgoing and incoming irradiance mismatch for SIF measurements may very likely obscure the contributions of the dark reactions, thereby causing the inconsistent findings previously reported, which were no change in far-red SIF and PAM fluorescence yields after clear reductions in the photosynthetic carbon assimilation efficiency of dark reactions. Our results confirm that high-quality SIF measurements have the potential to provide insights into the dark reactions of photosynthesis. This study is particularly relevant for better interpreting satellite SIF observations that are obtained under roughly constant overpass times and relatively stable light intensities.

However, there is a lack of information on deep soil carbon and water storage. The study investigates the effect of returning farmland to the forest on soil carbon accumulation and soil water consumption in 20-m deep soil profile in the hilly and gully region of the Chinese Loess Plateau. Four sampling sites were selected: Platycladus orientalis (Linn.) Franco forest (PO: oriental arborvitae), Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. Forest (PT: southern Chinese pine), apple orchard (AO) and farmland (FL, as a control). Soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) content were measured in 50-cm sampling intervals of 20-m soil profiles, as well as the associated factors (e.g. soil water content). The mean SOC content of PT was the highest in the 1-5 m layer and that of FL was the lowest (p<0.05). Compared with FL, the SOC storages of PO, PT and AO increased by 2.20, 6.33 and 0.90 kg m(-2) (p>0.05), respectively, in the whole profile. The SIC content was relatively uniform throughout the profile at all land-use types and SIC storage was 9-10 times higher than SOC storage. The soil water storage of PO, PT and AO was significantly different from that of FL with a decrease of 1169.32, 1161.60 and 1139.63 mm, respectively. After the 36-yrs implementation of the "Grain for Green" Project, SOC in 20 m soil profiles increased as a water depletion cost compared with FL. Further investigation is still needed to understand the deep soil water and carbon interactions regarding ecological restoration sustainability in the Northern Loess Plateau.

A new system, comprised of rainwater harvesting, concentrating infiltration with multi-holed pipe and mulching (RIM), was designed to sustain soil moisture at a proper level in rain-fed orchards in the hilly and gully loess region of China. This study monitored changes in soil moisture and distribution over soil profiles using four treatments: (a) RIM1 with two rainwater harvesting areas, two infiltration pipes and film mulching, (b) RIM2 with one rainwater harvesting area, one infiltration pipe and film mulching, (c) film mulching (FM) only and (d) traditional apple orchard as a control treatment (CK) as a baseline in this experiment. The results showed that mean soil moisture content (SMC) in a range of soil layer between 0 cm and 300 cm for RIM1 and RIM2 treatments increased by 43.01% and 34.78% in 2018 and 30.55% and 26.41% in 2019, respectively. Dividing the soil vertical profile into three layers, i.e., an easy-changing layer (0-60 cm), an increasing or decreasing layer (60-180 cm), and a relatively steady layer (180-300 cm), this study examined the vertical changes of soil moisture. The RIM1 and RIM2 treatments induced a large increase in the size and depth of wetted areas over the whole soil layers. The soil moisture was replenished to a horizontal distance of 1.5 m and 2.5 m apart from the trunk within the soil layer between 60 cm and 300 cm under the RIM1 treatment while only the horizontal distance of 1.5 m apart from the trunk under the RIM2 treatment. While the seasonal variation of SMC in the easy-changing soil layer (0-60 cm) corresponded to precipitation consistently, the SMC in the deep soil layers (60-300 cm) was not sensitive to precipitation. As a result, the treatments of RIM1, RIM2 and FM improved apple yield and crop water productivity compared with those under the control treatment. In particular, the RIM1 treatment performed the best among the treatments investigated in this study. The results highlighted the efficiency of the RIM system in enhancing the soil moisture, which may be useful to improve an orchard production for rain-fed orchards in the loess hilly and gully region of China.					戈, 文艳/ACN-1857-2022; Ding, Wen/JGD-3843-2023; Fei, Wang/J-8497-2013	Fei, Wang/0000-0002-5213-4399; Ding, Wenbin/0000-0002-0721-5843													0378-3774	1873-2283				JAN 1	2021	243								106496	10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106496	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106496													WOS:000594657700008

S.; Asewar, B., V			Morphophenological Characters and Productivity of Pigeon Pea [<i>Cajanus cajan</i> (L.) Millsp.] as Influenced by Crop Geometry and Plant Growth Regulators	LEGUME RESEARCH												Background: Intensive cultivation with suitable crop geometry for optimum utilization of resources is one of the possible ways for increasing productivity of pigeonpea. Plant growth regulators have the capacity to stimulate and inhibit physiological processes, which directly or indirectly might affect crop yield and quality. This investigation was planned to study the influence of crop geometry and foliar application of plant growth regulators on production potential of pigeonpea. Methods: The field experiment was conducted at experimental farm of Agronomy Department, V.N. M.K.V., Parbhani, during kharif season of 2018 and 2019. The experiment was laid out in split plot design with four main plot treatments and five sub plot treatments. The main plot treatments comprised of four crop geometries while the sub plot treatments were five treatments on foliar application of plant growth regulatorsalongwith control. Result: Various crop geometries shown remarkable effect on growth and developement of pigeonpea. The crop geometry of 60-120 cm. 20 cm and 90 cm. 20 cm recorded maximum plant height of pigeonpea as compared to other wider crop geometries. While in case of all the other growth attributes viz. number of functional leaves plant-1, leaf area, number of branches plant(-1) and dry matter accumulation plant(-1) crop geometry of 120 cm. 20 cm and 75- 150 cm. 20 cm were found superior as compared to othertreatments and were at par with each other. The yield per hectare was increased at closer crop geometry 60-120 cm. 20 cm as the lower per plant yield was compensated by higher plant population. The crop geometry 60-120 cm. 20 cm produced significantly higher seed yield (1661, 1982 and 1821 kg ha(-1) during 2018, 2019 and pooled mean respectively) over crop geometry of 120 cm. 20 cm and crop geometry 75-150 cm. 20 cm, but it was found at par with crop geometry 90 cm. 20 cm. Among the foliar application of plant growth regulators, growth characters viz., plant height, number of functional leaves, leaf area, number of branches and dry matter accumulation plant(-1) as well as chlorophyll content were enhanced with the foliar application of Brassinosteroids @ 0.1 ppm and application of NAA @ 40 ppm during both the years of study. Foliar application of Brassinosteroids @ 0.1 ppm also recorded early flower initiation and significantly highest seed yield (1742, 2018 and 1880 kg ha-1 during 2018, 2019 and in pooled data, respectively), while it was at par with foliar application of NAA @ 40 ppm.																			0250-5371					JUL	2022	45	7					883	887		10.18805/LR-4861	http://dx.doi.org/10.18805/LR-4861													WOS:000834791400014

For the sustainable management of common resources, policy interventions, such as farmer seminars, are necessary to ensure high-level cooperation among farmers for land conservation. However, the effects of this type of information provision are not well known. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the dissemination of conservation information on collaborative communal forest management using an economic field experiment with 936 farmers selected by random sampling from 11 villages in the northern Ethiopian Highlands. We conducted a public goods game experiment using a framework of voluntary contribution to communal land conservation with an intervention to remind participants about the consequence of their behaviors. The results show that the volunteer contribution increased after the intervention, and thereafter the decay of the contribution was slow. The results indicate that providing information about the consequences leads to a higher contribution. The effects of information provision are heterogeneous in terms of social condition, such as access to an urban area and social capital, and individual characteristics, such as wealth. These findings imply that information provision effectively improves farmer collaboration toward natural resource conservation in developing countries.

Field experiment results showed significant differences between genotypes for agro-morphological traits such as: number of capitula per plant, number of seeds per plant, 1000-seed weight and seed yield. Ten SRAP primer combinations generated 120 polymorphic bands with an average polymorphism information content (PIC) value of 0.23. High allelic variation using 10 SSR markers observed across genotypes, with an average value of 6.8 alleles per locus and relatively high value for PIC (0.69). Pooled molecular data (SSR + SRAP) were used to identify the population structure and genetic diversity using discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) and STRUCTURE analysis. The results revealed four clusters within the safflower accessions, while there was no strong correlation between geographical origins and estimated genetic diversity. Our results showed high genetic diversity for both agro-morphological and molecular analysis in the examined safflower germplasm. This mini core germplasm can be used for germplasm management and future safflower breeding programs.

Evan; Daly, Edoardo			Using multiple methods to investigate the effects of land-use changes on groundwater recharge in a semi-arid area	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Understanding the applicability and uncertainties of methods for documenting recharge rates in semi-arid areas is important for assessing the successive effects of land-use changes and understanding groundwater systems. This study focuses on estimating groundwater recharge rates and understanding the impacts of land-use changes on recharge rates in a semi-arid area in southeast Australia. Two adjacent catchments were cleared similar to 180 years ago following European settlement, and a eucalypt plantation forest was subsequently established similar to 15 years ago in one of the catchments. Chloride mass balance analysis yields recharge rates of 0.2 to 61.6 mm yr(-1) (typically up to 11.2 mm yr(-1)). The lower of these values probably represents recharge rates prior to land clearing, whereas the higher likely reflects recharge rates following the initial land clearing. The low pre-land-clearing recharge rates are consistent with the presence of old groundwater (residence times up to 24 700 years) and the moderate-to-low hydraulic conductivities (0.31 to 0.002 m d(-1)) of the aquifers. Recharge rates estimated from tritium activities and water table fluctuations reflect those following the initial land clearing. Recharge rates estimated using water table fluctuations (15 to 500 mm yr(-1)) are significantly higher than those estimated using tritium renewal rates (0.01 to 89 mm yr(-1); typically < 14.0 mm yr(-1)) and approach the long-term average annual rainfall (similar to 640 mm yr(-1)). These recharge rates are unrealistic given the estimated evapotranspiration rates of 500 to 600 mm yr(-1) and the preservation of old groundwater in the catchments. It is likely that uncertainties in the specific yield results in the water table fluctuation method significantly overestimating recharge rates, and despite the land-use changes, the present-day recharge rates are relatively modest. These results are ultimately important for assessing the impacts of land-use changes and management of groundwater resources in semi-arid regions in Australia and elsewhere.					; Cartwright, Ian/J-8549-2016	Barua, Shovon/0000-0002-6970-8205; Daly, Edoardo/0000-0002-2938-8374; Cartwright, Ian/0000-0001-5300-4716													1027-5606	1607-7938				JAN 5	2021	25	1					89	104		10.5194/hess-25-89-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-89-2021													WOS:000606805200002

Phenology Patterns Indicate Recovery Trajectories of Ponderosa Pine Forests After High-Severity Fires	REMOTE SENSING												Post-fire recovery trajectories in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) forests of the southwestern United States are increasingly shifting away from pre-burn vegetation communities. This study investigated whether phenological metrics derived from a multi-decade remotely sensed imagery time-series could differentiate among grass, evergreen shrub, deciduous, or conifer-dominated replacement pathways. We focused on 10 fires that burned ponderosa pine forests in Arizona and New Mexico, USA before the year 2000. A total of 29 sites with discernable post-fire recovery signals were selected within high-severity burn areas. At each site, we used Google Earth Engine to derive time-series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) signals from Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Operational Land Imager data from 1984 to 2017. We aggregated values to 8- and 16-day intervals, fit Savitzky-Golay filters to each sequence, and extracted annual phenology metrics of amplitude, base value, peak value, and timing of peak value in the TIMESAT analysis package. Results showed that relative to post-fire conditions, pre-burn ponderosa pine forests exhibit significantly lower mean NDVI amplitude (0.14 vs. 0.21), higher mean base NDVI (0.47 vs. 0.22), higher mean peak NDVI (0.60 vs. 0.43), and later mean peak NDVI (day of year 277 vs. 237). Vegetation succession pathways exhibit distinct phenometric characteristics as early as year 5 (amplitude) and as late as year 20 (timing of peak NDVI). This study confirms the feasibility of leveraging phenology metrics derived from long-term imagery time-series to identify and monitor ecological outcomes. This information may be of benefit to land resource managers who seek indicators of future landscape compositions to inform management strategies.

J	Abbas, F; Zhu, ZL; An, SS				Abbas, Fakher; Zhu, Zhaolong; An, Shaoshan			Evaluating aggregate stability of soils under different plant species in Ziwuling Mountain area using three renowned methods	CATENA												Soil stability is a characteristic property and is frequently used as an indicator of soil quality. Considering the large variation among stability tests, existing studies usually employ more than one stability test in order to better understand soil behavior against various disruptive forces. The main purposes of this study were to evaluate the impact of aggregate disruptive mechanisms (slaking, clay swelling, mechanical breakdown, and cavitation) on soils developed under different plant species. We aimed as well to compare the results of three renowned soil stability methods: modified Yoder (Yod), Le Bissonnais (LB) and Ultrasonic agitation (UA) on surface (0-20 cm) and subsurface (20-40 cm) soils. Overall, soils of three plant communities developed under eight plant species were investigated. These include forestland (Quercus wutaishansea, Pinus tubulaeformis, Platycladus orientalis, and Robinia pseudoacacia), shrubland (Sophora viccifolia, Hippophae rhamnoides, and Rosa xanthina) and grassland (Stipa bungeana). The mean weight diameter (MWD) was used as a stability parameter for modified Yoder's and Le Bissonnais' methods. In contrast, specific dispersion energies (SE) at the initial (10%, w/w), middle (50%, w/w) and final (90%, w/w) stages of aggregate disruption were used as stability parameters by the UA method. The results of MWD (Yod) indicated that surface and subsurface soils were in the range of 1.23-2.86 mm, which accounted for medium (0.8-1.3 mm) to very stable (>2 mm) soils. Among the three LB tests (fast wetting (FW), slow wetting (SW), and wet stirring (WS)), the order of aggregate disruption was FW > WS > SW, suggesting that FW was the most destructive among the three tests with the lowest MWD value (0.45 mm, unstable soil). SW showed the highest MWD values (0.82-2.82 mm), and most of the soils were ranked in the stable (1.3-2 mm) to very stable (>2 mm) range. The MWD trend of WS was similar to FW test. Although the range of SE at three levels was different: SE10 (8.1-29.4 J g(-1)), SE50 (53.0-193.4 J g(-1)), and SE90 (176-642 J g(-1)), they all showed a similar association with soil characteristics and stability parameters of other tests. The strong positive correlation of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), fine root biomass (FRB), and clay contents, and the negative correlation of soil water content (SWC) with the five tests, indicated that these five factors were the major characteristics responsible for the resistance of the studied soils against different destructive mechanisms (p < 0.05-0.01). Overall, the results of all five tests indicated that soil under Quercus wutaishansea (QW) was the most stable, while that under Robinia pseudoacacia (RP) was the most unstable. Although all methods were based on different breakdown mechanisms, initial and final soil fractions and parameters, they were strongly positively correlated with each other. This indicated that all these tests were equally good at stability assessment, with some distinctions and limitations.

J	Ren, YL; Zhang, JP; Fu, JX; Peng, SZ; Li, Z				Ren, Yuling; Zhang, Jingpeng; Fu, Jinxia; Peng, Shouzhang; Li, Zhi			Spatiotemporally varied extreme precipitation events simultaneously controlled by multiple circulation factors in China's Loess Plateau	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The intensive and frequent extreme precipitation events (EPE) greatly contribute to the severe soil loss in China's Loess Plateau, and it is thus essential to understand how and why EPE varies with space and time. Particularly, the combined influence of multiple factors on EPE has rarely been explored. This study analysed the spatiotemporal variability of EPE for 1961-2017 after defining six indices for intensity, frequency, and duration of EPE (R5d, SDII, R90t, R90n, CDD, CWD). We employed 12 atmospheric circulation factors to determine their combined effects on EPE on different time scales over time by the multiple wavelet coherence. The EPE indices spatially varied with obvious southeast-northwest gradients. Averaged across the whole plateau, SDII, R90t, and R90n increased insignificantly, while R5d, CDD, and CWD decreased insignificantly. In addition, the change trend had spatial variations with most wet EPE indices increasing in the north and the southernmost areas and decreasing in the middle-south areas. SDII, R90t, and R90n at 68%, 66%, and 53% of stations tended to increase, respectively, and R5d, CDD, and CWD decreased at 66%, 70%, and 77% of stations, respectively. The temperature had a greater correlation with the duration of EPE in summer and on the intensity and frequency of EPE in winter. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific North American teleconnection pattern (PNA), ENSO-Arctic Oscillation (AO), and ENSO-AO-PNA were found to be the main factors influencing EPE individually or simultaneously. This study provides technical support for the identification of combined effects of multiple factors, and the results are helpful for regional environmental management. Specific to the Loess Plateau, the identified individual or multiple factors can be used to project future changes in EPE, and the more frequent and intensive EPE in some regions may increase the difficulty in future soil loss control.

Evaluation of uncalibrated energy balance model (BAITSSS) for estimating evapotranspiration in a semiarid, advective climate	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The backward-averaged iterative two-source surface temperature and energy balance solution (BAITSSS) model was developed to calculate evapotranspiration (ET) at point to regional scales. The BAITSSS model is driven by micrometeorological data and vegetation indices and simulates the water and energy balance of the soil and canopy sources separately, using the Jarvis model to calculate canopy resistance. The BAITSSS model has undergone limited testing in Idaho, United States. We conducted a blind test of the BAITSSS model without prior calibration for ET against weighing lysimeter measurements, net radiation, and surface temperature of drought-tolerant corn (Zea mays L. cv. PIO 1151) in a semiarid, advective climate (Bushland, Texas, United States) in 2016. Later in the season (20 days), BAITSSS consistently overestimated ET by up to 3 mm d(-1). For the entire growing season (127 days), simulated versus measured ET resulted in a 7% error in cumulative ET, RMSE = 0.13 mm h(-1), and 1.70 mm d(-1); r(2) = 0.66 (daily) and r(2) = 0.84 (hourly); MAE = 0.08 mm h(-1) and 1.24 mm d(-1); and MBE = 0.02 mm h(-1) and 0.58 mm d(-1). The results were comparable with thermally driven instantaneous ET models that required some calibration. Next, the initial soil water boundary condition was reduced, and model revisions were made to resistance terms related to incomplete cover and assumption of canopy senescence. The revisions reduced discrepancies between measured and modelled ET resulting in ET, RMSE = 0.1 mm h(-1), and 1.09 mm d(-1); r(2) = 0.86 (daily) and r(2) = 0.90 (hourly); MAE = 0.06 mm h(-1) and 0.79 mm d(-1); and MBE = 0.0 mm h(-1) and 0.17 mm d(-1) and generally mitigated the previous overestimation. The advancement in ET modelling with BAITSSS assists to minimize uncertainties in crop ET modelling in a time series.

Determining the Best Drought Tolerance Indices using Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Insight into Application of Intelligent Agriculture in Agronomy and Plant breeding	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												In the present study, efficiency of the artificial neural network (ANN) method to identify the best drought tolerance indices was investigated. For this purpose, 25 durum genotypes were evaluated under rainfed and supplemental irrigation environments during two consecutive cropping seasons (2011-2013). The results of combined analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that year, environment, genotype and their interaction effects were significant for grain yield. Mean grain yield of the genotypes ranged from 184.93 g plot(-1) under rainfed environment to 659.32 g plot(-1) under irrigated environment. Based on the ANN results, yield stability index (YSI), harmonic mean (HM) and stress susceptible index (SSI) were identified as the best indices to predict drought-tolerant genotypes. However, mean productivity (MP) followed by geometric mean productivity (GMP) and HM were found to be accurate indices for screening drought tolerant genotypes. In general, our results indicated that genotypes G9, G12, G21, G23 and G24 were identified as more desirable genotypes for cultivation in drought-prone environments. Importantly, these results could provide an evidence that ANN method can play an important role in the selection of drought tolerant genotypes and also could be useful in other biological contexts.

However, estimates of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from reservoirs remain poorly constrained due to the absence of spatially and temporally resolved measurements. We performed high-resolution monitoring of CO2 emissions (F-CO2) in a semiarid hard-water reservoir to examine its seasonal and diel variability. Our results suggest that dissolved inorganic carbon input plays a central role in sustaining the surface water CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)), which varies from 1076 to 4587 mu atm. Although the reservoir is moderately to highly productive throughout the year, it is a net CO2 source with F-CO2 values in the range of 308-1753 mg C m(-2) d(-1). This high CO2 efflux indicates that productive waters are not necessarily CO2 sinks. Both pCO(2) and F-CO2 exhibit clear seasonal and diel patterns. Surface water pCO(2) is highest in March and presents a consistent diurnal/nocturnal pattern with the daytime pCO(2) 6-13% lower than the nighttime pCO(2). High CO2 efflux is observed during the ice-thaw period, indicating the release of CO2 that was accumulated during the winter. CO2 effluxes are typically higher during the nighttime driven by aquatic metabolism, but episodic weather events (e.g., rainfall and strong winds) can significantly enhance CO2 emissions and even reverse the diel pattern. Our study also shows that using only daytime measurements to estimate daily CO2 emissions would underestimate it by 9-25%. Hence, future global assessments should incorporate CO2 emissions from hard-water reservoirs and account for their seasonal and diel variability.

Average annual rainfall in the area is 94 mm. Runoff rainwater from natural hillside catchments, captured by terrace walls, augmented soil moisture in valleys to enable agriculture. Some terraced fields are farmed by Bedouin, who grow wheat and barley. Using these cereal varieties, we conducted novel investigations in this arid desert environment about the effect of plant ash, sheep dung and runoff water on grain sizes, delta C-13, Delta C-13, and delta N-15. Our study included both controlled pot experiments and traditional runoff farming by Bedouin. The pots were filled with local desert loess soil to investigate the effect of four different fertilizer treatments - (1) "None" for baseline data, (2) "Ash", (3) "Dung", (4) "Ash & Dung combined" - on the above cereal varieties. The largest cereal grains were produced by treatment 4 (ash & dung), which is a remarkable result, because it independently corroborates the archaeological findings. The pots received equal amounts of tap water, totalling 240 mm for barley and 325 mm for wheat. The Delta C-13 values of cereal grains in the pot experiments ranged from 15.62 to 17.47%. Concerning delta N-15, sheep dung produced a small increase, as compared to the baseline data, but plant ash fertilizer caused a decrease. Ash and dung together (treatment 4) yielded variable delta N-15 results. Stable isotopes of the same cereal varieties were also studied in the context of traditional runoff farming by Bedouin in terraced wadi fields in the area. Runoff water reception by terraced fields is by nature highly variable. A negative correlation was found between Delta C-13 of cereal grains and runoff soil moisture. The Delta C-13 values ranged from 12.59 to 17.44%. Concerning delta N-15, cereal grains from the drier fields had comparatively high values, while the wetter fields yielded the two lowest delta N-15 values. Nevertheless, other delta N-15 values from wetter fields were quite high, indicating the effect of additional factors besides runoff water. Though the Bedouin do not add fertilizers to the terraced fields, their sheep and goats graze the cereal stubble after the harvest. This leads to a spatially random and spotty distribution of manure, which may explain the diverging delta N-15 values.

J	Xu, X; Zhang, DJ				Xu, Xin; Zhang, Daojun			Comparing the long-term effects of artificial and natural vegetation restoration strategies: A case-study of Wuqi and its adjacent counties in northern China	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												The significant increase in vegetation coverage in northern China over the past two decades has attracted worldwide attention. Revegetation has been completed via artificial and natural restoration techniques, and the relative performance of each needs to be further explored. Although some studies have focused on the comparison between artificial and natural methods in vegetation restoration from a micro-perspective, there is a lack of evidence at the regional scale. This study considers Wuqi County and its adjacent areas of the Loess Plateau in northern China as our study area. First, natural and artificial restoration areas were identified. Then, the restoration sustainability of different restoration strategies and the adjustment effect of climate factors in the relationship between vegetation restoration strategy choice and vegetation restoration sustainability were analyzed. We found that the vegetation restoration strategies employed varied between local jurisdictions. In areas dominated by artificial restoration, vegetation coverage increased over a short period, but the growth rate diminished in the long term. In comparison, in areas mainly dominated by natural restoration, although the growth rate of revegetation was not very high in the short term, it was stable in the long term. In addition, the impact of vegetation restoration strategies on vegetation restoration sustainability exhibited spatial heterogeneity, and the temperature, humidity, and wind speed further affected strategy outcomes. This study provides a new perspective for vegetation restoration strategy evaluation and is expected to serve as a reference for the optimization of relevant ecological policies in the future.

Crop yield and soil fertility can be improved using measures such as optimized fertilization, conser-vation tillage, and crop rotation. A long-term study was conducted between 2007 and 2019 to evaluate the effects of optimized agriculture management on crop yield, economic profit and soil fertility. The following nine treatments were used: CK, local farmers' practice; F, optimization of fertilization; S, optimization of tillage method; R, optimization of cropping system; FS, optimization of fertilization and tillage method; FR, optimi-zation of fertilization and cropping system; SR, optimization of tillage method and cropping system; FSR, opti-mization of fertilization, tillage method and cropping system; HFSR, reduced half fertilization based on FSR. The results showed that grain yield was the highest (6129 kg ha-1) with FSR, and economic profit was increased by 3515 yuan ha-1, relative to CK. Moreover, FSR reduced soil bulk density and improved soil porosity and water storage. For soil nutrients, relative to CK, soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil available potassium (SAK) stock were 22 % and 46 %, respectively, in the 0-60 cm layer, and 7 % and 16 % higher in the 60-200 cm layer, while residual soil nitrate-N was lower in the 60-200 cm under FSR. The key soil nutrient factors affecting yield and economic profit were SOC (positive correlation) at 0-60 cm layer and nitrate-N (negative correlation) at 60-200 cm layer. HFSR had the highest fertilizer partial productivity, improved grain yield and economic profit relative to CK, which is based on sacrificing original soil fertility and resulted in soil degeneration. These findings provide important guidance for selecting effective integrated agricultural strategies to improve grain yield, profit, and soil fertility.

During sediment delivery, the coarse particles can be preferentially settled and the fine particles may be transported to downstream depositional sinks. However, the size-specific quantification of soil microbial communities and SOC composition and their roles in SOC stability have not been fully elucidated.Materials and methodsIn this study, two soils with similar textures but different aggregate structures were fractionated using a settling tube apparatus into three size classes according to their settling velocities. The individual soil particle-size aggregates and unfractionated soil were analyzed to determine (1) the diversity and composition of the soil microbial communities via 16S rRNA and ITS1, and (2) the SOC composition using mid-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.ResultsThe results showed that as the soil aggregate size decreased, the ratio of alkyl groups to carboxyl groups (C-H/COO, C-H/C=O) and soil CO2 emission per gram of SOC significantly decreased; however, the richness and diversity of the soil bacterial and fungal communities increased. Meanwhile, the aggregates of smaller size had lower relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Basidiomycota but higher relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Ascomycota. Rhizobiales was an indicator taxon for bigger soil aggregate communities, while Deinococcales, Capnodiales, and Venturiales were indicator taxa for communities with smaller soil aggregates. SOC composition showed a stronger direct effect on SOC stability in bigger soil aggregates (path coefficient, 0.68). However, SOC composition exerted a greater indirect impact on SOC stability by regulating soil bacterial and fungal community composition in smaller size aggregates (path coefficient, 0.65).ConclusionsOverall, our study provides a fundamental understanding of the chemical and microbial control of SOC stability at the aggregate level and highlights the potential impacts of aggregate-scale SOC decomposition on the fate of eroded SOC.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				JUL	2023	23	7					2878	2891		10.1007/s11368-023-03528-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-023-03528-5		MAY 2023											WOS:000982739800001

China covers a large area with a low density of weather stations in some (e.g., mountainous) regions. This study describes a 0.5' (similar to 1 km) dataset of monthly air temperatures at 2 m (minimum, maximum, and mean proxy monthly temperatures, TMPs) and precipitation (PRE) for China in the period of 1901-2017. The dataset was spatially downscaled from the 30' Climatic Research Unit (CRU) time series dataset with the climatology dataset of WorldClim using delta spatial downscaling and evaluated using observations collected in 1951-2016 by 496 weather stations across China. Prior to downscaling, we evaluated the performances of the WorldClim data with different spatial resolutions and the 30' original CRU dataset using the observations, revealing that their qualities were overall satisfactory. Specifically, WorldClim data exhibited better performance at higher spatial resolution, while the 30' original CRU dataset had low biases and high performances. Bicubic, bilinear, and nearest-neighbor interpolation methods employed in downscaling processes were compared, and bilinear interpolation was found to exhibit the best performance to generate the downscaled dataset. Compared with the evaluations of the 30' original CRU dataset, the mean absolute error of the new dataset (i.e., of the 0.5' dataset downscaled by bilinear interpolation) decreased by 35.4 %-48.7 % for TMPs and by 25.7 % for PRE. The root-mean-square error decreased by 32.4 %-44.9 % for TMPs and by 25.8 % for PRE. The Nash- Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients increased by 9.6 %-13.8 % for TMPs and by 31.6 % for PRE, and correlation coefficients increased by 0.2 %-0.4 % for TMPs and by 5.0 % for PRE. The new dataset could provide detailed climatology data and annual trends of all climatic variables across China, and the results could be evaluated well using observations at the station. Although the new dataset was not evaluated before 1950 owing to data unavailability, the quality of the new dataset in the period of 1901-2017 depended on the quality of the original CRU and WorldClim datasets. Therefore, the new dataset was reliable, as the downscaling procedure further improved the quality and spatial resolution of the CRU dataset and was concluded to be useful for investigations related to climate change across China. The dataset presented in this article has been published in the Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) at https:// doi .org/10.5281/zenodo.3114194 for precipitation (Peng, 2019a) and https:// doi .org/10.5281/zenodo.3185722 for air temperatures at 2m (Peng, 2019b) and includes 156 NetCDF files compressed in zip format and one user guidance text file.

Drip fertilization can significantly reduce N leaching by reducing irrigation and N application; however, the respective roles of each factor in reducing N leaching remain unknown. In this study, structural equation modeling was carried out to determine the direct and indirect relationships among factors related to N leaching in plastic shed tomato production across six consecutive growing seasons. Treatments were as follows: conventional flooding irrigation and fertilization (CIF); CIF + corn straw (CIF + C); CIF + wheat straw (CIF + W); drip irrigation and fertilization (DIF); DIF + corn straw (DIF + C); and DIF + wheat straw (DIF + W). The results showed that the most important contributing factor to N leaching in this study was water percolation, which is mainly controlled by irrigation amount. This suggests that irrigation amount has a greater effect than N input rate and straw addition. Compared to CIF, DIF significantly reduced N leaching by an average of 63.9% without compromising tomato yield, with significant increases of 52.9% and 28.1% in the water use efficiency (WUE) and partial factor productivity of applied N (PFPN), respectively. Meanwhile, application of straw also resulted in a significant reduction in N leaching by reducing water percolation, with wheat straw having a greater effect than corn straw. Overall, excessive irrigation rather than N input was found to be the main cause of significant N leaching, highlighting the importance of optimal irrigation schemes. We therefore recommend precise drip irrigation and fertilization combined with straw addition for sustainable and environmentally-friendly plastic shed vegetable production.

This is due to their general complexity, which mainly results from variation in soil, landform, vegetation, and erosion agents. Accordingly, we used the composite fingerprinting approach to trace sediment sources in a typical small catchment in this region. The aim was to reveal the erosion characteristics of the catchment throughout the trapping history of the check dam. Sediment sources were classified into three-source (paleosol, loess and sand) and four-source (paleosolgully, loess-gully, slope bare of sand and slope covered by sand) groups on the basis of soil and landform types, respectively. Sediment sources throughout the whole trapping history of the check dam (1978-2010) could be classified into three stages according to variation in sedimentation rate. Results showed that depositional sediment in the check dam was primarily from gullies (averaging 80.1%), especially the paleosol-gully (> 54.1%). The large contribution of gullies indicated that the main erosion agents were streamflow from rainstorm events and gravity. Coal mining also had a significant impact on contribution of sediment sources, especially for slopes. Since 1987, mining began to change the structure of hills in this region, leading to slope fissures, collapse, and landslides at junctions where gullies meet slopes, which increased the risk of slope erosion. This has caused an increase in sediment from slopes bare of sand distributed under condition of continues implementation of soil conservation measures, which converted sloping cropland into grassland or forest. Further studies are necessary to gain better insight into sediment transport and deposition within such complex environments, as well as to distinguish between the effects of multiple erosion agents.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				DEC 1	2020	379								114634	10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114634	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114634													WOS:000580657200002

Here, we demonstrate the effect of weather variables viz., maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall, morning and evening relative humidity, bright sunshine hours on the yield of rice cv. Swarna, grown across five rice ecologies of India through field experiments during kharif (wet) season (Jun-Sept.). Critical thresholds of weather elements were identified for achieving above average, average and below average yield for each ecology. The investigation could determine how different weather elements individually and collectively affect rice yield in different rice ecosystems of India. While a sudden increase in minimum temperature by 8-10 & DEG;C (> 30 & DEG;C) during reproductive period resulted in 40-50 per cent yield reduction at Mohanpur, a sudden decrease (< 20 & DEG;C) caused yield decline at Dapoli. The higher yields may be attributed to a significant difference in bright sunshine hours between reproductive phases of above-average and below-average yield years (ranging from 2.8 to 7.8 hours during P5 stages and 1.7 to 5.1 during P4 stages). Rice cultivar Swarna performed differently at various sowing dates in a location as well as across locations (6650 kg ha(-1) at Dapoli to 1101 kg ha(-1) at Samastipur). It was also found that across all locations, the above average yield could be associated with higher range of maximum temperature compared to that of below average yield. Principal component analysis explained 77 per cent of cumulative variance among the variables at first growth stage, whereas 70 per cent at second growth stage followed by 74 per cent and 66 per cent at subsequent growth stages. We found that coastal locations, in contrast to inland ones, could maximize the yield potential of the cultivar Swarna, due to the longer duration of days between panicle initiation to physiological maturity. We anticipate that the location-specific thresholds of weather factors will encourage rice production techniques that are climate resilient.					; SARATH CHANDRAN, MA/ABG-3178-2021	Bal, Santanu Kumar/0000-0002-0521-1347; sattar, Dr. Abdus/0000-0001-6834-7412; SARATH CHANDRAN, MA/0000-0002-0824-0426													1664-462X					AUG 9	2023	14								1226064	10.3389/fpls.2023.1226064	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1226064								37621886					WOS:001052708900001
J	Lei, N; Li, J; Chen, TQ				Lei, Na; Li, Juan; Chen, Tianqing			Respiration characteristics and its responses to hydrothermal seasonal changes in reconstructed soils	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Seasonal changes in respiration and the components of four reconstructed soils (gravel+meteorite+lou; gravel+shale+lou; gravel+sand+lou; and gravel+soft rock+lou) in barren gravel land were monitored using the soil carbon flux measurement system. The results showed that (1) the monthly average respiration rate and the rates of the components in the four reconstructed soils were the highest in summer and lowest in winter. In winter, the monthly average respiration rates of the four reconstructed soils were not different (p>0.05). In summer, the monthly average respiration rate of the sand or meteorite reconstructed soil was different from that of the other three (p<0.05). (2) The heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration rates were different between the four reconstructed soils (p<0.05). The contribution of heterotrophic respiration to total respiration in the four reconstructed soils was greater than that of autotrophic respiration throughout the year. In winter, autotrophic respiration accounts for the smallest proportion of total respiration. As the temperature rises, the proportion of autotrophic respiration to total respiration gradually increases and peaks in summer. In summer, the proportion of heterotrophic respiration in the total respiration is the smallest. With the decrease in temperature, the proportion of heterotrophic respiration in total respiration gradually increases and peaks in winter. (3) The maximum and minimum values of the monthly average respiration rate of the four reconstructed soils coincided with the months of maximum and minimum soil temperature. The soil volumetric water content changed with the amount of precipitation. The correlation between soil respiration and temperature was greater than that between soil respiration and volumetric water content. (4) The correlation in seasonal variation between respiration of the four remodelled soils and hydrothermal factors in the study area can be characterised by an exponential function and power-exponential function.																			2045-2322					JAN 8	2021	11	1							144	10.1038/s41598-020-80623-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80623-4								33420307					WOS:000634376100044

The experimental treatments included three soil water regimes (90%, 70% and 50% of soil water holding capacity, representing well watered, mildly and moderately water stressed conditions) and N application rates (109, 218 and 473 mg kg(-1) soil). Results showed that the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments increased the shoot dry biomass by 70.7-110.9% and the plant water use by 25.7-30.4%, consequently, the plant WUE was significantly improved compared to the moderately water stressed treatment. The specific leaf N content was significantly and positively correlated with plant carbon (C) accumulation that was increased by 66.9-89.9%, implying that the enhanced specific leaf N content in the well watered and mildly water stressed treatments could have facilitated the carbon fixation, thus increased the shoot biomass accumulation. Moreover, the well watered and mildly water stress treatments significantly increased leaf delta O-18, indicating the significantly higher transpiration in line with the markedly increased plant water use due to both the large leaf water concentration and the characteristic diel pattern of stomatal conductance associated with CAM. The enhanced leaf delta C-13 and plant WUE in the well watered and mildly water stress treatments were ascribed to the enhanced specific leaf N content and the improved leaf relative water content. The moderately water stressed treatment decreased leaf and root water potential while significantly intensified root endogenous ABA due to water deficit. The [ZR], [IAA] and [GA(3)] in the leaves and roots interacted complicatedly with water and N rates. The well watered and mildly water stressed treatments enhanced ability of the roots to absorb water and nutrients from the soil, resulting in the significantly higher N and N-15 accumulation. Conclusively, in the production of Ananas comosus maintaining high soil water supply is critical to achieve improved growth, water and fertilizer-N use efficiencies.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used to modify the surface of coal fly ash (CFA). The modified CFA was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface porosity analyzer, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results showed that loading CFA with SDS not only improved the functionality and surface morphology of the raw ash for the adsorption of organic pollutants, but also enhanced its thermal stability. The efficiency of the modified fly ash was tested in terms of removal of two non-polar organic pollutants namely chlorobenzene (CB) and nitrobenzene (NB) from aqueous phase. The maximum uptake capacity of chlorobenzene and nitrobenzene with SDS-modified coal fly ash (SCFA) was 225 mg/g and 90 mg/g, respectively. The kinetic analysis was done by controlled kinetic models, i.e., pseudo first and second order kinetic models. The results showed that adsorption of CB and NB onto SCFA followed a pseudo second order kinetic model. The adsorption of chlorobenzene was exothermic over the modified adsorbent while nitrobenzene showed an endothermic behavior. The isotherm analysis depicted the multilayer adsorption of both pollutants onto the surface of the surfactant modified adsorbent. This work has shown that surface modification using surfactants can be a viable option to enhance the adsorption capacity of fly ash for pollutants removal.

In arid and semi-arid river systems, waterholes are often the only refugia for aquatic organisms during no-flow spells. Sediment accumulation in waterholes reduces their persistence. Aims. To assess this threat, we surveyed the depth of, and dated, waterhole sediments from the Moonie River, a northern tributary of Australia's largest river system, the Murray-Darling Basin. Methods. Fine-sediment depth was determined in three of the deepest waterholes in 2010 and 2011 before, and after, the largest flood in over a century. The rate of sediment build up in two waterholes was also determined. Key results. In the deepest sections (>75th percentile depth), there was between 0.7 and 2 m of fine sediment in 2010. Following flooding, sediment depth reduced by 24-54%, with the largest proportional reductions in sediment occurring in the shallowest waterhole. However, net sediment accumulation is still 1.4-2.0 cm year(-1) since the 1950s. Conclusions. Sedimentation has reduced the persistence of the deepest waterholes by over 200 days, representing an up to 30% reduction. During the longest droughts known in the Moonie River, this would dry many otherwise permanent waterholes. Implications. Sedimentation is a marked threat to waterhole persistence even following large floods.																			1323-1650	1448-6059				2023 JUN 26	2023									MF23016	10.1071/MF23016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF23016		JUN 2023											WOS:001019883800001

The current study was carried out to evaluate grain quality and its relationship with agro-morphological characteristics of 15 durum wheat genotypes during two cropping seasons (2017-2018 and 2018-2019). Significant differences were observed between the genotypes for the investigated traits. The genotypes 'SRN-1/KILL//2*FOLTA-1', 'G-1252' and 'Germotel-1' showed the highest values for grain protein content (GPC), grain Fe content (GFeC), fiber content percentage (FC) and grain Zn content (GZnC) for both years, respectively. Local cultivar 'Zardak' had high grain yield (GY) and grain quality traits such as high FC and GZnC. The highest genetic and phenotypic coefficients of variation were observed for grain cadmium content (GCdC). GPC was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with GY. The FC showed a negative correlation with GZnC (r = - 0.51; P < 0.05) and positively correlated with GCdC (r = 0.63; P < 0.05). The results showed that the majority of important agronomic traits were negatively correlated with grain quality traits. Broad-sense heritability for the important traits such as GPC, GFeC and GZnC was high, that allows effective selection through bio-fortification breeding programs. The results demonstrated that durum wheat breeding for increased level of grain micronutrients and protein is feasible, thus, durum wheat germplasm could be considered in developing durum wheat cultivars having high grain quality characteristics.

It remains unclear whether drought priming at the early growth stage can be employed to alleviate drought stress during the post-anthesis drought period and improve water productivity (WP) in cowpea. Therefore, the physiological responses and WP as affected by drought priming were investigated. Two cowpea varieties (tolerant (V1) and sensitive (V2) to drought stress) were submitted to drought priming followed by water recovery and then subjected to subsequent drought stresses (80%, 60% and 40% of soil water holding capacity (SWHC)). The results showed that cowpea pre-exposed to drought priming acquired a stress imprint that alleviated the subsequent drought stress which occurred during the later growth stage as exemplified by the improvement of water status, photosynthesis, water productivity of biomass (WPb) and yield (WPy) as well as the modulation of plant hormones. Under the drought stress during the post-anthesis period, primed plants maintained lower [ABA](leaf) and higher [IAA](leaf) than plants without priming due to better plant water status for drought-primed plants. The results revealed that drought priming could modulate against [ABA] leaf increase under drought, as elevated [ABA](leaf) was the main reason for stomatal limitation, thereby decreasing photosynthesis and leading to great yield loss. Primed plants consumed 32% and 24% less water for V1 and V2, respectively, which significantly increased WP while decreased intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE;) of drought-primed plants. It is suggested that drought priming during the early growth period can be used as a promising strategy to save water use for irrigation while improving WP of crops in the regions where water is scarce.

The primary purpose of this study is to establish new sediment transport capacity formulas and evaluate their applicability to sediment. Materials and methods In this study, we collected three different soil types from Loess Plateau. Simulated sediment transport experiments were carried out in indoor flumes with energy gradients ranging from 6.9 to 20.8% and unit flow discharge rates ranging from 0.00014 to 0.00111 m(2) s(-1). Results and discussion We found an exponential relationship between sediment transport capacity, energy gradients, and unit flow discharge rates. The sediment transport capacity increased with increasing energy gradient and unit flow discharge, and the unit flow discharge had a more significant influence on sediment transport capacity compared with energy gradient. We used each composite force predictor and measured the sediment transport capacity according to the nondimensional principle, and the resulting data corresponded to different soils distributed in zones, as sediment transport capacity is controlled by a critical starting condition. After including soil clay particle content and volume sediment content in our formula, we were able to derive an accurate equation for calculating sediment transport. Conclusions Among the dimensionless composite force predictors, the dimensionless effective stream power was the most reliable predictor. The sediment transport capacity and effective stream power were related exponentially (R-2 = 0.953).					wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023; wang, dan/JEF-0836-2023; wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022														1439-0108	1614-7480				APR	2020	20	4					2289	2305		10.1007/s11368-020-02568-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-020-02568-5		FEB 2020											WOS:000516022300001

For every condition tested and in the all rivers tested, Cyprinidae was the richest family, containing 17 of the 39 identified fish species. Carassius auratus was the most common species, accounting for 11.3% of the total individuals. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), and similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) revealed that fish species composition differed significantly among rivers (p < 0.05), with dissimilar species assemblages found in the different rivers. Variation was influenced by a combined effect of habitat conditions, environmental factors, and human impact. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) identified variables explaining the variation in fish species (p < 0.05), and elevation contributed the most under both flow conditions. Alpha diversity decreased with increasing elevation within rivers as a result of changing environmental conditions, especially for wetted width. Alpha and beta diversities of rivers increased with increasing drainage area, which is related to habitat heterogeneity. The decrease in alpha diversity and the increase in beta diversity with increasing elevation can be explained by variations in habitat and geographic features.

However, often, the nutritional value of WEPs is unknown. This study was conducted to determine proximate and mineral contents of Balanites aegyptiaca, Cordia africana and Ziziphus spina-christi fruit. Fruit samples were collected from 10 trees of each species from Northern and Rift Valley region of Ethiopia. Fruit samples from the same species and district were mixed to form a composite sample, then dried, ground to powder and used for chemical analysis. We found a comparable amount of mean crude protein contents in C. africana and B. aegyptiaca. The fiber content was higher in B. aegyptiaca and Z. spina-christi. Carbohydrate and energy content were higher in Z. spina-christi compared to other study species. We found higher values of calcium in B. aegyptiaca and Z. spina-christi potassium, iron and zinc contents of B. aegyptiaca and C. africana, exceeded the value found in Z. spina-christi by about 50%. Our findings confirmed that the studied food tree species are potential sources of macronutrients and minerals. Therefore, promoting their sustainable use and increasing their abundance on different landscapes through Agroforestry system is critical to improve food availability and landscape resilience to climate change impacts.

SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE												Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of seed size and yield-related traits provide useful information to contribute to breeding programs. A recombinant inbred line population composed of 100 lines from a cross of Goli cultivar and breeding line AND1007 was grown in field and greenhouse conditions to identify QTLs controlling the important primary traits affecting seed size and yield-related traits. A linkage map consisting of 240 SNPs, spanning similar to 520 cM of common bean genome was used for QTL mapping. A total of 39 QTLs were identified on different chromosomes, which explained 5 to 32-32 % of the phenotypic variance for the measured traits. Thirty-one of them had only individual effects, six were only involved in three epistatic interactions and two had both individual and epistatic effects. Most of the positive alleles for seed size traits and number of seeds per pod originated from the Andean parent (AND1007) while the alleles related to number of pod and seeds per plant originated from Mesoamerican parent (Goli). QTLs for seed weight, seed length and seed yield co-localized on the Pv09, suggesting these traits may be controlled by QTLs that are linked together or have pleiotmpic effects. A major QTL was found for seed length (SL9.1(GA)) which explained similar to 32 % of the phenotypic variance and had repeatability over field and greenhouse trials. Overall, results showed that QTLs with single-locus additive and epistatic effects were involved in the control of bean seed size and yield-related traits while the effects of epistatic interactions were smaller than single-locus QTLs.

Search for practical solutions are focused on reserving the limited rainfall into topsoil layer to meet plant water demand. Based on fieldwork, this study evaluates the blocking effects of Pisha sandstone on soil water leakage, by inserting sandstone layers in the different soil depths (10-15 cm, 20-25 cm, 30-35 cm), which act as isolation layers within the sandy soil. Results showed that the inserted Pisha sandstone layers significantly decreased the soil water infiltration rates at the different stages and cu-mulative infiltration. The inserted sandstone layer at the depth of 10-15 cm presented the highest permeability resistance, and its initial infiltration rate, stable infiltration rate and average infiltration rate decreased by 102.42 mm h-1, 144.30 mm h-1 and 132.79 mm h-1, respectively. Meanwhile, the soil water content in the 5-10, 20-25, and 30-35 cm soil layers increased by 2.17%, 2.20%, and 1.37%, respectively, due to the inserted Pisha sandstones. This experimental study proves that the insertion of Pisha sandstones effectively hinders the downward penetration of soil water in sandy soil. These findings provide a new alternative for an effective solution of the fast water leakage problem of sandy land.

We questioned whether the addition of N and C, two important soil elements, would have different effects on plant functional groups and on the main plant species in an alpine steppe meadow ecosystem at an altitude of 4700 m. Methods: A two-factor completely randomized design study was used, with the addition of three levels of N (0, 50 and 100 kg N ha(-1); urea as N source) and three levels of C (0, 60 and 120 kg C ha(-1); sucrose as C source) and four replicates, each year from 2011 - 2014. Effects at the community, plant functional groups and species levels were examined in an alpine steppe meadow. Results and discussion: With N and C as a single additive, biomass of grasses increased while forbs decreased. Sedges remained unchanged with N addition and increased with C addition. These results may be due to competition among Stipa prpurea, Poa alpigena, Kobresia humilis and forbs for light resources. This effect could be explained by the increase in cover of the major gramineous species, Stipa purpurea, while the cover of the sedge, Kobresia humilis, tended to decrease or showed no change with N addition. High level of N addition alone produced highest biomass in a year of low natural primary production (without C and/or N addition). After the addition of N and C together, the biomass of the three plant functional groups did not change or even decreased compared with either C or N addition. Furthermore, C addition increased community stability but N addition did not. Conclusions: The effects of N and C addition on the biomass of plant functional groups were complicated by the interaction between N and C, as well as by a major effect of initial standing biomass. With the addition of both N and C, the biomass of grasses increased and forbs decreased, especially in low natural primary production years. With C as a single additive, the biomass of sedges increased as did community stability. Consequently, management of plant biomass using N and/or C addition depends on both the plant functional group target and the species within the group, as well as the natural primary production. Predicting environmental factors that potentially affect primary production are crucial in a decision-making nutrient management system.

Although high CO2-uptakevia chemical processes is the major CO2-uptake process in saline and alkaline soil, microorganisms may affect the exchange of inorganic carbon between the soil solution and the solid phase. Some studies related to microbial processes on carbonate formation have been published, but seldom focus on saline and alkaline soils. To determine the microbial effects on the inorganic C flux and CaCO3 recrystallization, sterile and non-sterile Solonchak samples were incubated in a (CO2)-C-14-labelled atmosphere at two CO2 concentrations (0.2% and 2%). The C-14 activity was measured in the soil solution, air, and in CaCO3 after 2, 7, 21, 92 and 197 days. The C-14 in dissolved organic carbon in the sterile and non-sterile soils was below 5% of the C-14 input C-14 trapping in CaCO3 increased with the decrease of the C-14 remaining in the gaseous CO2. Carbonate recrystallization increased logarithmically with time (R-2 > 0.96). A two percent initial CO2 concentration lead to higher CaCO3 recrystallization (5-50 x 10(-3)% of initial CaCO3) compared to a 0.2% initial CO2 concentration (0.8-7 x 10(-3)% of initial CaCO3) from 2 to 197 days. CaCO3 recrystallization (% of initial CaCO3) in the sterile Solonchak was higher by 10% to 190% than the non-sterile Solonchak, indicating that the microorganisms decreased the C-14 trapping of CaCO3 by 4-23% from 2 to 197 days. We assume that microorganisms grew on the carbonate surface like a coating. This must have retarded the carbonate recrystallization. We concluded that the soil CO2 concentration is the most important factor for CaCO3 recrystallization. The presence of microorganisms strongly decreased the CaCO3 recrystallization. CaCO3 recrystallization process including CO2 in soil water could be the abiotic CO2 uptake from the atmosphere by saline and alkaline soil.

Energy partitioning between plant canopy and soil, performance of the two-source energy balance model in a vineyard	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Partitioning of evapotranspiration (ET) into soil water evaporation and transpiration allows separate assessment of soil and plant water, energy, and carbon exchange. Remote sensing-based models are ideally suited to monitor ET over large areas, but ET partitioning estimates vary widely. The objective of this study was to evaluate the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model for seasonal ET partitioning using total, soil, and vine canopy energy balance fluxes measured over a vineyard in the Negev desert in Israel. Energy fluxes were evaluated with the original TSEB and three adapted versions using (1) measured soil heat flux, (2) optimized plant transpiration parameterization, and (3) measured soil and vine temperatures instead of composite surface temperature as model inputs. Optimization of plant transpiration parameters revealed a model tendency to underestimate transpiration due to underestimation of available energy and potential transpiration. Adaptations included, among others, accounting for higher leaf radiation absorption expected in dense clumped canopies, which increases available energy, and increasing the Priestley-Taylor coefficient from 1.26 to 2, which increases potential transpiration. While the original TSEB gave reasonable total energy fluxes, the vine energy fluxes were greatly underestimated. Both soil heat flux and plant transpiration adaptations improved modeled vine energy fluxes throughout the season under both well-watered and water-stressed conditions. However, the performance of the TSEB version using measured soil and vine temperatures was inferior to applying the standard TSEB with composite temperature. While daily energy fluxes could be estimated with reasonable accuracy, sub-daily fluxes proved to be more challenging and merit further research. Finally, changes in ET partitioning with canopy development and in response to water stress could be detected quite well albeit it with an underestimation of the transpiration fraction of ET, which, on average, amounted to 39% using standard TSEB and 6% with optimized plant transpiration parameters.

Therefore, it is critical to characterize and quantify the changes in landscape patterns and ecosystem service value (ESV), especially at the county level, to provide sustainable land-use plans to local policymakers. This study mapped land use for 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015 by using remote sensing imagery of Yongshou County, a typical hilly-gully region in Loess Plateau, and quantified the changes in landscape patterns by using spatial metrics. It employed the benefit transfer method to estimate changes in ESV. The results showed the following: (1) Grassland, forestland and cropland were the main land-use types, with the most increased area in forestland and grassland. (2) The landscape pattern was becoming more fragmented, and connectivity and accessibility decreased. (3) The total ESV increased by 3.5 million RMB, mainly because of increased ESV in grassland; meanwhile, synergies existed among regulation and support services, and trade-offs existed among supply services and regulation. (4) The changes in land-use types and landscape patterns had significant positive effects on the ESV. These results on ESV change with land-use support scientific decision-making services for the formulation of land-use planning and landscape structure adjustment plans at the county level to ensure sustainable management of ecosystems.

M.			Interaction between soil water and fertilizer utilization on maize under plastic mulching in an arid irrigation region of China	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Plastic film mulching (PM) has become a widely used cropping method in arid and semiarid areas. However, it is unknown how different PMs affect crop water and N utilization and their interaction under different N supplies. A two-year field experiment was conducted in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID), in northwest China. Following local irrigation practices, 500 mm border irrigation was used to grow spring maize over two growing seasons (2019 and 2020) with two N levels: high-N (225 kg N ha(-1)) and low-N (150 kg N ha(-1)). Combined with three mulching methods, the experiment had five treatments: (i) no mulching with high-N (control, CK), (ii) black plastic film with high-N (HB), (iii) transparent plastic film with high-N (HT), (iv) black plastic film with low-N (LB), and (v) transparent plastic film with low-N (LT). The 4 PM treatments had higher average soil water storage (0-120 cm) than CK. The PM treatments had the highest water consumption coefficients (K-wcn) at 6-leaf to 12-leaf stage (K-wc2) and milking to maturity (K-wc5) stage. The HP treatments (HB and HT) had higher soil nitrogen storage than CK during the growth period. Averaged across two seasons, HB and HT had 23.9%, 29.2% respectively, higher grain yields than CK. Averaged across two seasons, the transparent PM treatments had 7.49%, 5.31%, and 1.72% higher water use efficiency (WUE), partial factor productivity of nitrogen (PFPN), and harvest index, respectively, than the black PM treatments. The PM treatments showed the relationship between water use efficiency of biomass (WUEb) and nitrogen use efficiency of biomass (NUEb), with WUEb increased, NUEb also increased. Given these results, we recommend the high-N level and transparent PM for maize cropping to increase yield and resource utilization efficiency in the HID.

Therefore, it is important to analyze the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in the topsoil of this region. The Sigma 16PAHs concentrations between 1980-1999 and 2000-2019 ranged from 1134.20-15871.04 and 1010.67-18,068.80 mu g kg(-1), with average values of 5021.30 and 5662.82 mu g kg(-1). All samples displayed heavy pollution levels according to European soil quality standards. In addition, among the measured physicochemical properties, the soil organic carbon (SOC) had the greatest influence on PAHs, while soil particle size distribution had the smallest effect. Source apportionment indicated that the two main sources were petroleum source (37.57%) and vehicular traffic source (25.88%). Lastly, an assessment of the carcinogenic risks illustrated that more focus should be placed on the dermal pathway in which the human body is exposed to soil PAHs. Overall, the carcinogenic risks in different populations did not exceed 10(-4), but there was still a potential carcinogenic risk in some age groups, especially in adult women.

A global synthesis reveals more response sensitivity of soil carbon flux than pool to warming	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Purpose Climate change continues to garner attention in the public sphere. Most recognize its potential to affect global carbon (C) dynamics in the biosphere. Many posit that global warming promotes the decomposition of soil organic C (SOC) and increases soil C release. However, it remains unclear how soil C dynamics respond to different influencing factors (e.g., warming method, magnitude/duration, mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP)) across ecosystems on a global scale. Materials and methods Here, we performed a meta-analysis to identify the general global patterns of how warming impacts soil C dynamics. Results and discussion Across all terrestrial ecosystems, warming reduced SOC by 4.96% and stimulated soil microbial biomass C (MBC), soil respiration (SR), and heterotrophic respiration (HR) by 6.30, 14.56, and 8.42%, respectively. Warming affected soil C pools in grasslands and soil C fluxes in forests. The changes in SOC did not correlate to warming magnitude/duration or climate factors (MAT and MAP). However, changes in both MBC and SR did correlate to warming magnitude/duration and MAT. The changes in HR showed a quadratic response to warming magnitude and a linear response to MAP. Open-top chamber method can effectively affect soil C pools. SR proved to be more sensitive than HR to most warming methods. Conclusions Our results showed that soil C release exhibited more sensitivity to warming magnitude/duration or MAT/MAP than did net soil C sequestration. These results indicate that warming induces accelerated transition of soils from C sink to C source. Furthermore, they show the potential for global warming effects to exacerbate the positive feedback loop in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the declining rates-of-change in SR and HR under high magnitude warming may mitigate the positive feedback. Our analyses can improve the predictions of feedback between atmospheric and soil C pools.

Nevertheless, the long-term changes in crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of three major cereals (maize, wheat and rice) in response to field management practices are rarely reported. This meta-analysis evaluated the effect of field management (nitrogen input (N), irrigation, fertilizer type, fertilization frequency, and irrigation method) on crop yield and WUE between 1990 and 2020 based on 3152 observations. We found that the N thresholds for maize, wheat, and rice were 150-200 kg ha(-1),140-210 kg ha(-1), and 90-135 kg ha(-1), respectively. N fertilization within the threshold levels increased the crop yield and WUE of maize (84% and 74%), wheat (47% and 41%), and rice (55% and 30%). The irrigation (mm) thresholds for maize and wheat were 180-240 mm and 300-400 mm and crop yield and WUE were increased by 37% and 13% for maize and by 84% and 41% for wheat. Agricultural management increased yield and WUE (% and %) through drip irrigation (23 and 13 maize; 31 and 14 wheat), alternate wetting and drying (AWD) (26 and 30 rice), split fertilization (31 and 21 maize; 64 and 40 wheat; 33 and 25 rice) and organic-inorganic fertilizer (43 and 39 maize; 68 and 66 wheat; 38 and 34 rice). With the increase in HI (humidity index) from 10 to 30, the contribution of irrigation to WUE decreased, but that of fertilization increased. This study concludes that N fertilizer and irrigation applications between threshold levels along with suitable field management is a win-win strategy to achieve climate-smart agricultural production with minimum damages to soil and environment and at lower dependence on fertilizer and irrigation.

Although convincing evidence exists that mixed-species plantations are more conducive to increase the productivity and stability of forest ecosystems than monocultures, the effect of mixed-species plantations on the understory plant diversity (UPD) remains uncertain. This study conducted a meta-analysis based on 205 paired observations of plant species mixtures and corresponding monocultures from 76 peer-reviewed studies to assess the impact of tree mixtures on the UPD in China. The results showed that the UPD was on average 18.2 % higher in mixed-species plantations than in monocultures. This positive mixture effect increased over time, but it would take at least ten years for the effect size of UPD to change from negative to positive. In terms of different mixed forest types, tree-shrub mixtures were more beneficial to maintain the UPD than treetree mixtures, and this positive effect was more significant over time. In addition, the response ratio of UPD decreased with mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP), but this relationship was not significant. Therefore, our results suggested that planting mixed-species plantations was a more effective approach to enhance the UPD than monocultures in China. This study revealed the characteristics of UPD under different afforestation modes and could provide a scientific basis for forest management.

Vegetation index like normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a typical parameter extracted from spectral images for LAI estimation. However, it always faces challenges of values saturation and sensitivity decreasing due to the canopy coverage changes and complex environment influences. Therefore, the study aims to propose a method to explore deep features based on deep learning model (ResNet50) and vegetation index (VI) map, by which contributes to improve the accuracy of maize LAI estimation. In two-years' experiments of 2020 and 2021, the multi-spectral imaging sensor carried by the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to collected remote sensing images of the maize canopy during multi-growth stages under different nitrogen fertilizer treatments, and a total of 792 LAI values were collected. In terms of feature extraction, 10 VIs were extracted based on the spectral images of maize canopy, and comprehensive features (texture and deep features) were extracted based on the VI map. In terms of model construction, partial least squares regression (PLS) models were constructed based on three feature types. The results showed that normalized difference red edge (NDRE) VI was the best indicator for monitoring maize LAI among all the VIs investigated. Meanwhile, LAI multivariate linear model constructed based on texture features extracted from NDRE images had better accuracy. Deep features of NDRE images were further extracted by ResNet50 model. And the maize LAI estimation models based on PLS were constructed with VI, texture features and deep features of two-year data, respectively. The results showed that compared with VI and texture features, the LAI estimation model based on deep features showed optimal accuracy in two-year data (R2 = 0.827, greater than 0.781 and 0.780; RMSEP = 0.405, less than 0.455 and 0.455; MAE = 0.320, less than 0.366 and 0.363). In addition, the LAI estimation model based on deep features was successfully evaluated with 2020 and 2021 validation data (2020: R-2 = 0.872, RMSEP = 0.379, MAE = 0.294; 2021: R-2 = 0.733, RMSEP = 0.433, MAE = 0.348). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep feature extraction method based on deep learning model and VI images in LAI estimation, which provides a feasible method for monitoring crop growth information based on UAV platform.

Previous studies of water age have concentrated on individual catchment hydrological components, such as river water, groundwater, plant water or soil water, which hinders the dynamic linking of various hydrological components in the critical zone. In this study, the isotopic compositions of precipitation, soil water, xylem water, river water, and groundwater in a subtropical catchment in China were continuously monitored for two years. We found that the seasonal isotopic cycles of shallow soil water (0-60 cm), xylem water and river water had different attenuations and phase shifts relative to those of precipitation. There were no obvious seasonal isotopic cycles of deep soil water (60-130 cm) and groundwater. Additionally, the transit time distributions (TTDs) of soil water at the depth of 0-10 cm, xylem water and river water in the catchment varied between the wet year and normal year. With increasing depth, the mean transit times (MTTs) of soil water increased and the F-yw decreased. For xylem water and soil water, the MTTs and F(yw )in the wet year were shorter and larger than those in the normal year, respectively. The river water consisted of a small proportion of fast flow components and a large proportion of slow flow components, with the young water accounting for 16% in the wet year and 21% in the normal year. Our results contribute to an improved understanding of water ages, flow paths and linkages of different hydrological components in the critical zone at the catchment scale.					, 啸遥/L-5118-2019; Rao, Zhiguo/D-5393-2009; 戴, 军杰/GQP-3514-2022	, 啸遥/0000-0002-5323-1844; Rao, Zhiguo/0000-0002-5323-1844; 戴, 军杰/0000-0002-2487-084X; He, Xinguang/0000-0002-7570-3224; /0000-0003-1571-0681													0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2022	612		B						128138	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128138		JUL 2022											WOS:000874855100004

Spincoated devices exhibited a maximum power conversion efficiency of 17.75% but showed little difference between samples with and without the polymer ink additive. For inkjet-printed devices, the combined optimization of printing parameters and the amount of the polymer additive in the precursor ink enabled a perovskite layer with increased quality. In comparison, devices with added PTB7 improved the power conversion efficiency to 10.35% as compared to 8.0% for cells prepared without the polymer additive. The effect is attributed to the modified crystallization dynamics of the perovskite layer by the PTB7 addition after inkjet printing and improved quality of the resulting perovskite layers. We found that the effect of the polymer additive on film formation in spin-coated samples was obscured when using an antisolvent drip, but the incorporation of PTB7 has a positive effect on the opto-electronic quality of thin films, indicated by the increased grain size and the photoluminescence quantum yield. Our results emphasize the technological potential of polymer additives in perovskite precursor inks when using scalable manufacturing processes, such as inkjet printing, where the control and induction of controlled crystallization are more difficult to implement by additional quenching steps.

Theory offers two contradicting hypotheses for the expected effects of fragmentation on seed dispersal strategy. On the one hand, fragmentation may select for increased dispersal by purging poor dispersers that are incapable of moving between patches (spatial sorting). On the other hand, fragmentation may select for reduced dispersal due to the increased cost of leaving a colonized patch; especially whenever the surrounding matrix is hostile. Furthermore, fragmentation can have additional indirect effects on dispersal through its' effects on abiotic and biotic environmental characteristics, but these pathways are rarely accounted for. Empirical evidence testing these hypotheses in plants comes mainly from distinctly fragmented landscapes at either very large scales or very small scales, whereas studies at intermediate scales, such as those that characterize many agricultural landscapes are lacking. Here, we quantified direct and indirect effects of fragmentation-related characteristics, such as patch size and isolation level, on multiple dispersal-related traits of a heterocarpic annual plant in a fragmented agricultural landscape. Using a structural equation modelling approach, we examined whether fragmentation had positive or negative effects on seed dispersal potential and seed dispersal-related traits. Overall, we found more support for the spatial sorting hypothesis. However, the patterns were not simple, nor consistent across all traits and paths. The positive association between fragmentation and dispersal was mainly via a negative effect of connectivity on seed dispersal potential, but the effect of patch area on dispersal traits was less clear. We identified multiple direct and indirect effects of fragmentation-related patch characteristics on dispersal-related traits. Furthermore, the relative importance of direct and indirect effects was qualitatively different between overall effects. Our findings show that different characteristics of fragmented habitats may differentially affect different dispersal-related traits, and that these effects may take place via multiple paths, often leading to a complex relationship between fragmentation and dispersal.

However, the long-term responses of N-cycling potential and microbial functional genes to different fertilization sources remain unclear. Soil samples were collected to a depth of 20 cm under winter wheat applied annually with N fertilizer (NF), organic manure (OM), N fertilizer plus organic manure (NM), and a control without fertilization (CK) for 35 yr, and they were analyzed for microbial functional genes involved in soil N cycling using metagenome sequencing in the Loess Plateau of China. Soil N fractions were greater with OM and NM than NF and CK. The total abundances of N-cycling genes were 9.3% (p < 0.05) greater with NM than CK, and 8.2% (p < 0.05) and 12.2% (p < 0.01) higher with OM and NM than NF, respectively. Compared to CK, OM and NM increased the abundance of genes associated with nitrification, denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction, and assimilatory nitrate reduction, but decreased the abundance of genes related to organic N metabolism. However, NF increased the abundance of genes involved in nitrification. Both OM and NM also enhanced the relative abundance of Proteobacteria carrying N-cycling genes but reduced those of Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria. Soil organic carbon, total N, and potential carbon mineralization were the dominant factors affecting the abundances of N-cycling genes. Long-term application of OM and NM can promote N cycling by enhancing gene abundance due to increased soil organic matter and microbial biomass compared to NF and CK.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY												An auxin response factor delays leaf senescence via protein-protein interaction and competitively binding to promoter regions of a transcription factor in common wheat. Auxin plays an important role in regulating leaf senescence. Auxin response factors (ARFs) are crucial components of the auxin signaling pathway; however, their roles in leaf senescence in cereal crops are unknown. In this study, we identified TaARF15-A1 as a negative regulator of senescence in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by analyzing TaARF15-A1 overexpression (OE) and RNA interference lines and CRISPR/Cas9-based arf15 mutants. OE of TaARF15-A1 delayed senescence, whereas knockdown lines and knockout mutants showed accelerated leaf senescence and grain ripening. RNA-seq analysis revealed that TaARF15-A1 delays leaf senescence by negatively regulating senescence-promoting processes and positively modulating senescence-delaying genes including senescence-associated phytohormone biosynthesis and metabolism genes as well as transcription factors (TFs). We also demonstrated that TaARF15-A1 physically interacts with TaMYC2, a core jasmonic acid (JA) signaling TF that positively modulates wheat senescence. Furthermore, TaARF15-A1 suppressed the expression of TaNAM-1 (TaNAM-A1 and TaNAM-D1) via protein-protein interaction and competition with TaMYC2 for binding to its promoter to regulate senescence. Finally, we identified two haplotypes of TaARF15-A1 in global wheat collections. Association analysis revealed that TaARF15-A1-HapI has undergone strong selection during wheat breeding in China, likely owing to its earlier maturity. Thus, we identify TaARF15-A1 as a negative regulator of senescence in common wheat and present another perspective on the crosstalk between auxin and JA signaling pathways in regulating plant senescence.

In this study, D(+)-xylose was used to prepare an adsorbent with rich O groups and three-dimensional porous structures for Cr (VI) adsorption. What's more, the adsorption sites of many oxygen groups in the material were combined with the three-dimensionally connected porous structures, which made the adsorption sites fully in contact with Cr (VI). At the concentration of 300 mg/L, the removal rate of Cr(VI) was 94.50%, 6.4 times that of the non-porous treatment and 9.6 times that of the non-porous and O group treatment. The adsorbent showed a high adsorption capacity (910.10 mg/g) for Cr(VI), and the adsorption model proved that the adsorbent was a multi-molecular layer adsorbent. In addition, the adsorption was controlled by chemical reaction and diffusion, which was also attributed to the three-dimensional porous structure and abundant oxygen groups of the material. XPS and FTIR indicated that four O groups participated in the adsorption reaction (-OH, C-O-C, C= O, and C-O), and C-O-C and C-O were the main reaction sites. After treating wastewater from electroplating plants with X-PC, the discharged water met international and domestic discharge standards (Cr(VI) removal rate > 99.90%).

However, studies of runoff simulation accuracy and attribution analysis in large-scale basins based on multi-source data and different scenario projections are limited. This study employed the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in conjunction with spatial interpolation techniques to evaluate the accuracy of Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), China Meteorological Assimilation Driven Dataset (CMADS), and observation (OBS) in runoff simulations, and configured various scenarios using the Patch-generating Land-use Simulation (PLUS) model to analyze effects of climate and land-use changes on runoff in the Jing River Basin from 1999 to 2018. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the CMADS+SWAT model compared to than CFSR+SWAT model, as the latter underestimated peak runoff. Changes in precipitation had a stronger impact on runoff than temperature, with increased flow from farmland and strong interception effects from forestland. Integrated climate and land-use changes led to an average annual runoff reduction of 1.24 m3/s (I2), primarily attributed to climate change (1.12 m3/s, I3), with a small contribution from land-use change (0.12 m3/s, I4). CMADS exhibited robust applicability under diverse scenarios, effectively enhancing runoff simulation accuracy. The findings provide invaluable guidance for water resources management in semi-arid regions.

Based on the principles of locating interfaces in layered media and measuring dielectric properties by time domain reflectometry (TDR), we developed TDR-based measurement of changes in the air-soil interface along the TDR probe for soil erosion measurement, and simultaneously measuring volumetric soil moisture content (theta(v)). Part of a three-rod TDR probe was inserted in the soil and the rest exposed to air, so changes in the air-soil interface could be denoted by changes in the length of exposed probe (L-air). TDR waveforms were analyzed using a combination of tangent line method and second-order bounded mean oscillation methods to identify time points at positions of impedance discontinuity in electromagnetic propagation, then converting these data to Lair and theta(v) by calibrated equations. According to the laboratory experiment using sandy loam and silt loam, L-air could be effectively measured within a wide soil moisture range by the calibrated equation and the thickness of the eroded soil layer could thus be determined. The RMSE of theta(v) measurement ranged between 0.003 and 0.025 cm(3) cm(-3), which enabled the identification of the appropriate soil moisture range for measuring L-air, and achieve reliable simultaneous measurement of soil erosion and soil moisture content. The simulated rainfall experiment using sandy loam and silt loam and field scouring experiment conducted in loam also indicated that the proposed method could achieve high measurement accuracy in erosion environments, for which Lair with the RMSE from 1.8 to 2.1 mm and theta(v) with the RMSE from 0.007 to 0.024 cm(3) cm(-3). The proposed method has various advantages, including versatility, minimal disturbance, easy automation of measurement at multiple positions, etc., could serve as a new technical option for soil erosion measurement, and extend the utilization of TDR.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				NOV	2022	218								106571	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106571		AUG 2022											WOS:000861010000003

The antioxidant activities of potato seedlings at two different temperatures were compared. In addition, the effects of high temperature and normal temperature on the growth phenotype and antioxidant system physiological indexes of potato seedlings were analyzed by high temperature treatment. According to the significant change characteristics of SOD activity of antioxidant index at different temperatures, the SOD genes of potato were screened and bioinformatics analysis and gene expression analysis were carried out. The results showed that high temperature inhibited the antioxidant activity of potato seedlings and affected the growth of potato seedlings. The growth of potato seedlings can be promoted in medium and low temperature environment. In the future research, the experimental results can be used as the theoretical basis for potato planting.

Here, the soil water response of different plant functional groups (legumes, grass, and forbs) were studied along a legume grassland degradation succession according to the above-ground biomass and the proportion of each functional group. In particular, changes in the soil water storage (SWS), soil properties (soil capillary porosity (CP), and soil organic matter) and plant traits (proportion of functional groups and below-ground biomass) were quantified in a continuously cultivated legume grassland for fifteen, sixteen, eighteen, and twenty-two years, without any tillage. The experimental plots were located in the semi-arid region of the Chinese Loess Plateau, in a flat area without runoff contribution. All plant and soil samples, and measurements, were obtained in a few days to minimize the temporal variability. SWS increased at 50-150 cm soil depth when the proportion of legume functional group (LFG) decreased from 70% to 5%, and this increment was ca. 20% at 50-100 cm soil layers. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H), the species richness (R), LFG, CP, and the non-capillary porosity (NCP) were significantly correlated with SWS (P < 0.05). The infiltration capacity significantly improved when the proportion of LFG accounted for 5%, which favored the recharge of the soil water reservoir with rainfall. Roots decay apparently improved the soil structure, and favored water infiltration, providing a suitable condition for latter vegetation growth. This study underlined the significant interaction that exists between the plant functional groups and the soil water processes during the artificial legume grassland succession. We proved that plant composition can change the surface hydrologic cycle, and the soil water exchange, in rainfed grassland.

The main purpose of this research was to assess the genotype by environment interaction (GEI) and yield performance of 20 maize genotypes in 16 different environments of Huang-Huai-Hai area, China. In this research, the additive main effects and multiplicative interactions (AMMI) model was applied to analyze the GEI effect and to evaluate the suitability and yield stability of 20 different maize genotypes. The AMMI model analysis indicated that genotype (G), environment (E) and GEI had significant effects on grain yield and the contribution to the total sum of squares difference was 3.10%, 35.05% and 42.25%, respectively, suggesting that GEI was the primary factor affecting grain yield. The AMMI model analysis partitioned sum of squares of GEI into fourteen interaction principal components axes (IPCA), of which all the IPCA were significant (P < 0.01) and the first five IPCA (IPCA1, IPCA2, IPCA3, IPCA4 and IPCA5) explained 77.7% of variation. The AMMI model analysis using IPCA1 scores and G main effect indicated that two genotypes Hengyul47 and Hengyu321 had relatively stable performance across the environments. Among the locations, Quwo was the most productive site in distinguishing genotypes and the most representative environment. In conclusion, this study suggested that genotype and environment interactions were the major source of variation in maize yield, and use of AMMI model seemed useful for screening and identifying the response of summer maize genotypes in different environments.

J	Zhao, Y; Wang, L				Zhao, Ying; Wang, Li			Coordination of available soil water content and root distribution modifies water source apportionment of the shrub plant<i> Caragana</i><i> korshinskii</i>	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Stable isotopes have been widely used to identify root water uptake (RWU) by classifying potential water sources as distinct endmembers and evaluating their contributions to xylem water. However, the estimated contributions of endmembers (mainly soil layers) are usually based on variations in soil water isotopes alone. Available soil water and root distributions are key limiting factors of RWU but are rarely considered in water source appor-tionment. Thus, we have compared the relative contributions of distinct soil layers based on mean soil water isotope values, and values weighted by both available soil water content (AWC) and root weight density (RWD), to RWU of Caragana korshinskii. We derived these values (hereafter mean and weighted contributions, respec-tively) using three Bayesian mixing models (SIAR, simmr and MixSIAR) at three sites with different water conditions. We calculated the differences between the mean and weighted contributions (DC) and the accu-mulation of the absolute value of DC (AADC) to analyse the differences between them and their relationships with AWC and RWD. Both the weighted and mean contributions varied with sites and models. We obtained the following AADC values: 27, 8 and 11 % for Sites 1-3, respectively, using SIAR; 39, 13 and 14 %, respectively, using simmr; 68, 40 and 25 %, respectively, using MixSIAR. We detected a significant correlation between DC and RWD when AWC & LE; 6 %, as well as a significant correlation between DC and AWC when AWC > 6 %, indicating that the influence of RWD on DC depended on soil water conditions. Based on our findings, end-members weighted by AWC and RWD altered the proportion of water source allocation relative to non-weighted endmembers, while the magnitude of the effect was related to the model used. Thus, we suggest careful consideration of the characterisation of endmember isotopes and model selection when partitioning plant water sources using 82H and 818O.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 20	2023	900								165893	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165893	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165893								37524172					WOS:001051830400001

Quantitative information related to significant findings is essential for assessing nutritional provision and preventing pasture degradation. Here, we developed a new Pasture Quality Index (PQI) that indicates the nutritional quality of pastures based on their nutritional value and the composition of plant functional groups of the vegetation. We applied the model on a regional scale using VEN & mu;S satellite data, collected more than 450 plant samples, and applied pasture quality parameters analysis. Pasture samples were collected from paddocks under two different grazing intensities in Israel in a semiarid and a Mediterranean grassland. Pasture quality was estimated five times over two years at mid- and peak vegetation growth stages. The PQI included: protein content, fiber content, dry matter digestibility and the proportion of unpalatable spiny thistles. A support vector machine regression model was used to train statistical models that relate ground truth PQI data to the reflectance values of the VEN & mu;S satellite. Large-scale forage quality maps at 5 m spatial resolution were created. Fine-resolution drone orthomosaics were used to enhance the satellite-based predictions accuracy, resulting in a model accuracy of R2 = 0.86. We observed that nutritional quality showed strong dependence on seasonality and the grazing regime, with higher quality observed during mid-growth compared to peak growth. Higher quality was also observed under grazing compared to ungrazed paddocks. The occurrence of unpalatable thistles in grazed paddocks significantly reduced the pasture quality at the Mediterranean grassland. To summarize, the PQI enables the integration of several quality indicators into an index that helps in detecting the effects of grazing management on rangelands. In addition, high accuracy was achieved in relating the overall PQI and high spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery data. Our developed methodology enables site-specific, spatially explicit, frequent, and area-extensive pasture quality assessment that can aid in optimizing livestock management in various ecosystems.

However, the role of EPF2 in potato (Solanum tuberosum) has not been investigated to date. Here, we cloned and characterized the potato EPF2-like gene (StEPF2). StEPF2 is predominantly intercellular space localized and its transcripts were rhythmically expressed, and showed the highest expression in apical unexpanded leaves. Expression of StEPF2 was markedly down-regulated in response to abscisic acid and sodium chloride treatments; however, upon the application of polyethylene glycol, the expression of StEPF2 peaked at 4 h and then decreased gradually. Overexpression of StEPF2 in Arabidopsis (OE) substantially reduced stomatal density and photosynthetic rate, but had little effects on plant growth. Under drought stress, OE lines maintained higher photosynthetic rates, photosystem II efficiency, and instantaneous water use efficiency than wild-type (WT) plants. Moreover, OE lines showed less water loss and hydrogen peroxide accumulation in detached leaves compared with WT plants. Thus, our results suggest that StEPF2 acts as a negative regulator of stomatal development in potato, indicating that the role of EPF2 is conserved across plant species. Overall, StEPF2 represents an important target for the development of drought-tolerant potato cultivars via genetic engineering.					zhang, chunmei/IUQ-7038-2023; zhang, cl/JDW-6549-2023; Yin, Lina/AAA-9723-2019	deng, xi ping/0000-0003-4577-9217													1863-5466	1863-5474				AUG	2020	14	4					479	490		10.1007/s11816-020-00627-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11816-020-00627-4		MAY 2020											WOS:000534203400001

Microorganisms associated with microbial iron [Fe(III)] reduction are prevalent and presumed to be closely linked with biological nitrogen fixation in flooded paddy soils.The relationship between the nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) and their responses to organic carbon addition were investigated based on the metabolically active bacterial community in flooded paddy soils amended with/without glucose (CK: 0 mol C kg(-1 )soil; OC: 0.1 mol C kg(-1) soil). Both putative NFBs and FeRBs were affiliated to the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, which were the two most abundant phyla in the metabolically active bacterial community. Glucose addition remarkably altered the community structures of the putative NFBs and FeRBs during a 40-day incubation, and the relative abundances of putative NFBs and FeRBs in the OC treatment increased by 0.21%-1.62% and 2.22%-14.82% relative to the CK treatment, respectively, during the later stage of incubation. The putative FeRBs co-occurred with NFBs and hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria, and the relative abundances of NFBs and hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria showed significant positive correlation with that of respiratory FeRBs. Some FeRBs could also be capable of nitrogen fixation and/or hydrogen oxidation. Thus, it might be feasible to enhance biological nitrogen fixation iciency by promoting the metabolic activities of FeRBs (such as by adding glucose), which contribute directly to biological nitrogen fixation associated with nitrogen-fixing Fe(III) reducers and indirectly by reducing the suppression of hydrogen on nitrogen fixation associated with hydrogen-dependent Fe(III) reducers.

Most phenology response investigations are based on the phenology observed under circumstances of varieties changing over time, which then necessitates disentangling the role of climate change from the effect of changing varieties using various models. However, results from such studies are limited by the uncertainties caused by model mechanisms and assumptions and parameter calibration and validation. In this study, phenology observations were made for varieties of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and spring maize (Zea mays L.) at 11 agro-meteorological observation sites in north China. The varieties observed for each species did not change over a period of at least 15years. The observations were used to investigate the measured phenology response to climate. Dates of major wheat phenology stages tended to occur earlier due to warming, but the trend in rice and spring maize was not clear. Growth duration was shortened during the vegetative period of winter wheat, but was prolonged during vegetative period of rice and in the reproductive period of winter wheat and rice. Growing degree days (GDD) were generally increased for both vegetative and reproductive periods for all crops except during the vegetative period for winter wheat. We found that most trends in date of phenology stages, duration of growth phases, and GDD were similar to previous reports in which the varieties observed did not remain constant. This indicates that previous reports are likely to have overestimated the effect of cultivar shifting on crop phenology and underestimated the role of climate. Based on our results, growth duration under future warmer conditions may be longer than previously simulated, and hence yield may also be higher than previously estimated.

To address this issue, researchers have repeatedly underlined the need for greater emphasis on the development and promotion of energy efficient, and environmentally sound novel fertilizers, in addition to improved agronomic management to augment nutrient use efficiency for restoring soil fertility and increasing farm profit. Hence, a fixed plot field experiment was conducted to assess the economic and environmental competency of conventional fertilizers with and without nano-urea (novel fertilizer) in two predominant cropping systems viz., maize-wheat and pearl millet-mustard under semi-arid regions of India. Result indicates that the supply of 75% recommended N with conventional fertilizer along with nano-urea spray (N75PK+nano-urea) reduced the energy requirement by similar to 8-11% and increased energy use efficiency by similar to 6-9% over 100% nitrogen through prilled urea fertilizer (business as usual). Furthermore, the application of N75PK+ nano-urea exhibited similar to 14% higher economic yields in all the crops compared with N50PK+ nano-urea. Application of N75PK+nano-urea registered comparable soil N and dehydrogenase activities (35.8 mu g TPF g(-1) 24 hrs(-1) across all crops) over the conventional fertilization (N100PK). This indicates that application of foliar spray of nano-urea with 75% N is a soil supportive production approach. More interestingly, two foliar sprays of nano-urea curtailed nitrogen load by 25% without any yield penalty, besides reducing the greenhouse gases (GHG) emission from 164.2 to 416.5 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) under different crops. Therefore, the application of nano-urea along with 75% N through prilled urea is an energy efficient, environmentally robust and economically feasible nutrient management approach for sustainable crop production.

Currently, there is limited information on the effects of changes in precipitation extremes on river sediment load over a long time period at the basin scale. The objectives of this study were to quantify the effects of variations in precipitation extremes on sediment load in the Second Songhua River Basin (SSRB), northeast China.Materials and methodsDaily precipitation data from 10 meteorological stations within the SSRB and sediment load data during 1960-2014 from the basin outlet hydrological station were collected. Six extreme precipitation indices, such as erosive precipitation (ERPTOT), wet-day precipitation (PRCPTOT), very wet day precipitation (R95pTOT), flood season precipitation (FSPTOT), maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1day) and heavy precipitation (HP), were used to detect the precipitation extremes. The Mann-Kendall non-parametric trend analysis was used to analyze the dynamic changes in precipitation extremes and sediment load. The double cumulative curve method was used to assess the effects of changes in precipitation extremes on sediment load.Results and discussionThe results indicated that six extreme precipitation indices showed periodic variations from 1960 to 2014, while they did not show any significant change trend in the SSRB (p > 0.05); however, the sediment load showed an extremely significant decreasing trend (p < 0.01) over the past 55 years. Sediment load significantly correlated with six precipitation extremes indices (p < 0.05). Compared with the baseline period (1960-1977), the sediment load was reduced by 1.12 x 10(6) ton per year (1977-2014). The contribution of precipitation extremes to the sediment load ranged from -22.83% to 6.97%. The corresponding contribution of the non-precipitation factor to sediment load was from 93.03% to 122.83%.ConclusionsThe change in precipitation extremes was not the main reason for the sediment load reduction. Sediment load reduction in the SSRB was due to the interactions between multiple factors. Non-precipitation factors, such as reservoir construction, were the main reasons for the sediment load reduction. These findings are useful to understand the variation of river sediment load and to adopt countermeasures to relieve potential risk of precipitation extremes.

Methodologically, there is little known about how to distinguish accurately the type of wheat flour and, in the meantime, to restrain food fraud. Therefore, non-destructive methods are necessary for identification, in turn, the spectroscopy method has the potential to be one of the most efficient non-destructive methods. Given the importance of high-purity wheat flour for consumers and food industries, this research introduces the five most cultivated flour varieties in Iran that were classified by FT-MIR spectroscopy. Different preprocessing techniques and unsupervised and supervised models investigated the spectral data of flour varieties. The best outcome came with the standard normal variate (D2 + SNV) preprocessing method and with all supervised models. The accuracy of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was 100% for the test dataset. In conclusion, it is recommended flour industries use the FT-MIR spectroscopy and chemometrics techniques, the combined form of these techniques helps these industries be aware of the purity of produced flour as possible.

J	Yang, Q; Zhang, DJ				Yang, Qi; Zhang, Daojun			The influence of agricultural industrial policy on non-grain production of cultivated land: A case study of the "one village, one product" strategy implemented in Guanzhong Plain of China	LAND USE POLICY												As a populous country, China has always attached importance to the protection of cultivated land and food security. However, in the process of promoting rural development, agricultural industrial policies introduced by local governments may affect the realization of food security. Although there are many studies paying attention to the influence of agricultural industrial policy on food security, quantitative analyses are lacking. This paper takes the "one village, one product" strategy (OVOP) implemented in the Guanzhong Plain of China as an example. Through remote sensing and GIS technology, the ranges of the non-grain production of cultivated land (NGPOCL) from 2000 to 2018 were extracted for the study area. The regression discontinuity design was used to analyze the impact of the OVOP on the NGPOCL increase using the county as the basic sample. On these bases, food security was analyzed combined with the established evaluation indicators. The results show that 35 of the 47 counties in the Guanzhong Plain owned a significant jump in the NGPOCL area after the implementation of the OVOP, which indicates that the OVOP is an important reason for the NGPOCL expansion; meanwhile, the pressure index of cultivated land increased by 29.53%, which means the OVOP implementation has threatened food security seriously. This study can offer the authorities a clear truth and severity of the negative impacts of industrial policies, and warn them to be more cautious in implementing industrial policies.

However, the underlying biotic and abiotic mechanisms of ecosystem multifunctionality under global change and land use remain poorly understood. In this study, a 3-year field experiment was conducted in a semi -arid steppe in Inner Mongolia to investigate the relative importance of different biotic and abiotic factors in regulating aboveground ecosystem multifunctionality (AEM) and belowground ecosystem multifunctionality (BEM) in response to resource input after long-term grazing. The experiment involved three grazing intensities (1.5 low, 4.5 moderate, and 9.0 high sheep/ha) with a 7-year difference in grazing history. Precipitation (W) and nitrogen deposition (N) were manipulatively increased during the growing season. The study focused on exploring the effects of various biotic factors (e.g. species richness, functional diversity, plant functional groups) and abiotic factors (e.g. soil environment variables) on AEM and BEM. The results revealed asymmetric responses of AEM and BEM to resource input. Resource input enhanced AEM, but not BEM. However, increasing grazing intensity substantially reduced BEM, though we noted that AEM and BEM decreased the most under moderate grazing. Interestingly, the study found consistent responses of single ecosystem functions and ecosystem multifunctionality to resource input across the three grazing blocks. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis indicated that species richness primarily enhanced AEM, while soil environment played a major role in promoting BEM across different grazing history intensities and the whole grazed system. Multiple biotic and abiotic factors with varying relative importance in different grazing history scenarios controlled AEM and BEM. Species richness exhibited a strong influence on AEM and BEM, but within a narrow effect threshold range, whereas soil environment had a lesser effect size but a wider threshold range. This study provides the first evidence that grazing history and resource enrichment jointly regulate AEM and BEM. The findings highlight the importance of considering biodiversity conservation, soil health, and land use history in management practices aimed at maintaining ecosystem multifunctionality under climate change and human activities scenarios.

However, its reported performance lags significantly behind its theoretical limit. Toward determining routes for efficient photo-oxidation on hematite, we investigated the role of hole-trapping surface states as reaction intermediates using sacrificial reductant reagents as hole scavengers, H2O2 and FeCN. Photoelectrochemical characterization at low scavenger concentrations and intermediate potentials, as opposed to previous studies at high scavenger concentrations, has shown the reaction mechanism to include competitive photo-oxidation between water molecules and the hole scavengers, similar for both H2O2 and FeCN. Using operando Raman spectroelectrochemistry, we show similar transient features for both scavengers, interpreted as scavenger adsorption to a two-site reaction intermediate participating in the photogenerated hole transfer of water photo-oxidation, hence the competition. These findings strengthen the significance of hole-trapping surface states for water photo-oxidation on hematite and the previously suggested two-site reaction pathway for efficient hole transfer in this reaction. A better understanding of the mechanisms of photoelectrochemical water splitting can assist in improving the efficiency of solar hydrogen production.

J	Sun, XQ; She, DL; Fei, YH; Wang, HD; Gao, L				Sun Xiaoqin; She Dongli; Fei Yuanhang; Wang Hongde; Gao Lei			Three-dimensional fractal characteristics of soil pore structure and their relationships with hydraulic parameters in biochar-amended saline soil	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Due to poor soil quality, coastal saline soil limits soil productivity. Therefore, it is of great importance to find appropriate and efficient methods to improve the quality of coastal saline soil. Biochar has been widely used as a soil amendment to improve soil properties, but the effects of biochar amendment on soil pore structure and soil hydraulic properties are unclear. In recent years, with the development of fractal theory and computer technology, fractal geometry based on image analysis has been employed for quantitatively characterizing the structure and heterogeneity of soil pores. In this study, field experiments were established with three proportions of straw biochar (0, 2 and 5 %, w/w) to study the biochar amendment effects on soil structure and soil hydraulic properties. Three replicates were set for each treatment. The results showed that the addition of biochar to saline soil improved soil pore structures and soil hydraulic characteristics. The biochar amendment led to the strong pore spatial variation, complex pore structure and irregular pore shape. The biochar-amended saline soil had a high considerable water retention capacity (theta(S), AWC). Biochar had a long-term effect on saline soil improvement. For multifractal analysis, it is better to use the Delta D and Delta alpha values to analyze the multifractal characteristics of soil. The heterogeneity of the soil pore distribution became stronger after biochar amendment. Multifractal parameters had significant changes with the time of biochar amendment. The changes of soil pore structure resulted in the improvement of soil hydraulic characteristics. The K-s value improved as the pore connectivity increased. The strong pore spatial variation, complex pore structure and irregular pore shape aided in increasing the theta(s) value. The available water content value was improved as the number of soil pores, especially the micropores, increased. In response, this study proposes a new approach to analyzing soil pore structure to explain the association between the soil pore structure and soil hydraulic characteristics in biochar-amended saline soil.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				JAN	2021	205								104809	10.1016/j.still.2020.104809	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.104809													WOS:000582696400048

M.; Liu, Yu; Zhao, Jingxue; Wu, Gao-Lin			Mattic epipedon fragmentation strengthened the soil infiltration capacity of a hillside alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	ECOHYDROLOGY												Degradation of hillside alpine meadow ecosystems is a widespread problem that usually results in the fragmentation of the mattic epipedon (ME). The mattic epipedon plays a well-known role in the hydrological cycle of alpine ecosystems due to its high water-holding capacity. However, little is known about how ME fragmentation alters soil infiltrability-a key soil property that influences runoff and erosion processes as well as soil moisture dynamics. To address this issue, we contrasted the infiltration rates and soil and plant characteristics of preserved meadow patches (with full ME) and patches at two stages of ME fragmentation, namely, half ME and without ME. Our results showed that mattic epipedon fragmentation reduced aboveground plant biomass (mainly of sedges) by 58.6-65.6 g m(-2) and root biomass by 5,643-10,054 g m(-2). Soil compressive strength (11.6 kg cm(-2)) and total soil porosity (52%) of fragmented meadow patches without ME were significantly lower than in those with half (17.9 cm(-2) and 62%, respectively) or full ME (31.7 cm(-2) and 62.5%, respectively). In contrast, non-capillary porosity and aggregate stability slightly increased with fragmentation and were highest at patches without ME. Importantly, soil infiltration rates in hillside alpine meadows greatly increased as a result of mattic epipedon fragmentation. Initial infiltration rates were approximately 10 and 20 times higher at patches with half ME and without ME (177 mm h(-1) and 326 mm h(-1), respectively) than at patches with the full ME (17 mm h(-1)). Moreover, steady-state infiltration rates were approximately 6 and 9 times higher at patches with half ME and without ME (60 mm h(-1) and 88 mm h(-1), respectively) than at patches with the full ME (17 mm h(-1)). Overall, mattic epipedon fragmentation improved soil infiltrability by changing the soil and plant characteristics. These findings suggest that mattic epipedon fragmentation will lower runoff maintenance and have drastic effects on the water provisioning function of hillside alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

J	Yan, XQ; Jiao, JY; Tang, BZ; Liang, Y; Wang, ZJ				Yan, Xi-qin; Jiao, Ju-ying; Tang, Bing-zhe; Liang, Yue; Wang, Zhi-jie			Assessing sediment connectivity and its spatial response on land use using two flow direction algorithms in the catchment on the Chinese Loess Plateau	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Severe soil and water loss have led to widespread land degradation on the Loess Plateau in China. Exploring the relationship between land use and sediment connectivity can be beneficial to control soil erosion. In this study, three catchments in the Yanhe River Basin on the Loess Plateau were selected to analyse the relationship between land use and sediment connectivity using grey correlation method. Index of connectivity (IC) was employed to quantify sediment connectivity, including two flow direction algorithms (D8 and D-infinity) and two final targets of sediment transport (outlet and main channel of catchment). Then, 11 landscape metrics were used to evaluate the land use spatial patterns of catchments. By comparing the IC value ranges, histograms and classes, and their relationship with remote sensing images of the two flow direction algorithms, we find that the D8 algorithm is more suitable for this study area. The results showed that the three catchments are characterized by high sediment connectivity in the grassland and forest close to the channel. In addition, the roads and bare land close to the channel also have high or medium sediment connectivity. Grey correlation analysis showed that landscape division index (DIVISION), fractal dimension index (FRAC-MN), aggregation index (AI), total class area, patch cohesion index (COHESION), and largest patch index (LPI) indices were the main factors that affect sediment connectivity at the class scale. At the landscape scale, the landscape shape index (LSI), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), and gully density have an essential effect on sediment connectivity. This condition provides a way to control the sediment connectivity in the watershed by transforming land use type or changing its spatial pattern, but specific adjustment measures have to be further explored.

Thus, reliable information on the forest soil organic carbon (SOC), along with the factors that influence it, is crucial from the perspective of regional carbon budgets and climate modeling. Gansu Province in northwestern China is characterized by complex climatic gradients and diverse forest types, suggesting a large variability in the spatial distribution of SOC, yet the SOC stock in this region has not been comprehensively investigated because of insufficient soil profile data. Our study covered the entire forest area in the province via a regional-scale sampling campaign, and provided soil organic carbon density (SOCD) data obtained from 112 natural forests and 100 plantations. Influencing factors including forest type, forest stand age, soil type, litter carbon, climate, and topography were evaluated in both natural forests and plantations. The results indicated a SOC stock of 433.4 +/- 13.2 Tg C and a SOCD value of 175.3 +/- 33.0 Mg C ha(-1) for the 0-100 cm layer at the regional scale. Specifically, the SOC stock and the forest area-weighted average SOCD in natural forests were estimated at 349.0 +/- 16.5 Tg C and 207.3 +/- 23.2 Mg C ha(-1), which were about quadruple and double, respectively, of the values for the plantations. Regardless of natural forests and plantations, SOCD increased with both stand age class and elevation and decreased with mean annual temperature (MAT). SOCD also increased with mean annual precipitation (MAP) for natural forests with elevation < 2500 m and for all plantations. The overall importance to SOCD of the explanatory variables increased with increasing soil depth in natural forests while decreased with increasing soil depth in plantations. Forest type, stand age, soil type, MAT, MAP, elevation, litter carbon, slope, and aspect explained 58 and 65% of the total variation in the SOCD at 100 cm depth in natural forests and plantations, respectively. In natural forests, the most important explanatory variable for the uppermost 30 cm was soil type, while it was MAT for the whole 100 cm; in plantations, the most prominent factors were forest type and elevation, regardless of the soil depth. These suggest that environmental changes will likely have different effects on SOCD in natural forests and plantations.

The Kriging interpolation maps presented a clear north-to-south (high latitude to low latitude) increasing trend in contents of crude protein and dietary fiber and decreasing trend in contents of crude oil, phospholipids, saponins, and carotenoids. Soybeans with high-level of total oligosaccharide were concentrated in the central region. Based on the geographical distribution of soybean nutritional components, weather conditions, and cultivation systems, the soybean production areas in China were divided into three regions and 10 subregions. This study highlights the geographic distribution of soybean nutritional compositions and provides scientific evidence for guiding the construction of high-quality edible soybean production bases in China.					song, wenwen/HSI-2161-2023; Jiang, Bingjun/GWQ-4354-2022														0963-9969	1873-7145				FEB	2023	164								112364	10.1016/j.foodres.2022.112364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2022.112364		JAN 2023						36737952					WOS:000919466500001

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of water stress (WS) at different growth stages on maize plant development, root morphology, water utilization, hormone signaling and N accumulation under various N conditions. A set of controlled drought stress at 60% field capacity was conducted from bell (V12) to tassel (VT) stage (V12-VT, denoted as W1W2), from silk (R1) to milk (R3) stage (R1-R3, denoted as W2W1) and their compound stages (V12-R3, denoted as W1W1) under high- and low-N supply, respectively. The results indicated that compared to the well-watered control (W2W2), W2W1 reduced root length, root area, and shoot dry matter by 4.68-19.15%, 5.92-11.97% and 4.38-29.61%, respectively, while W1W2 promoted the root system and improved the shoot growth, grain formation and plant water use efficiency (WUEp). High N supply tended to aggravate WS with a poorer root system and lower leaf water potential (psi leaf) but higher leaf abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation at different growth stages. Leaf ABA significantly increased while stomatal conductance (Gs) decreased under WS and N-rich environment, hence increasing leaf intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi). Root zeatin-riboside (ZR) was higher for well-watered and N-rich conditions. Moreover, leaf ABA significantly increased with the decrease of psi leaf (R2 =0.51 for R3, R2 =0.35 for dough stage (R4)) and the variation of psi leaf was relatively constant (<= 0.3 MPa) with different water treatments, indicating that maize performed isohydric behavior to response water stress and N-rich environment. This study suggests that to promote the potential of water- and N-saving and improve crop productivity in maize cultivation, mild water stress at vegetative growth stages and appropriate N supply are of great importance.

J	Xu, X; Zhang, DJ				Xu, Xin; Zhang, Daojun			Evaluating the effect of ecological policies from the pattern change of persistent green patches-A case study of Yan'an in China's Loess Plateau	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Evaluation from landscape pattern change can comprehensively reflect the impact of ecological policies on the ecosystem service function. However, previous assessments based on landscape patterns only considered land cover type and ignored the quality of vegetation cover, which could hardly reflect regional differences in restoration durability and sustainability. Based on the temporal phase characteristics of the vegetation index, this study proposes the concept of Persistent Green Patches (PGPs). Taking Yan'an, a key area for the implementation of ecological projects in the Loess Plateau, as a study area, the effect of ecological policies was evaluated from the pattern change of PGPs from 2000 to 2017 through Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA). It is found that (1) the area of PGPs was increased from 14.45% to 44.26% in Yan'an since the implementation of the ecological projects; (2) the Grain for Green projects can hardly form a short-term increase of PGPs; while the Natural Forest Protection projects can quickly increase the PGPs area, its effect would tend to be saturated or even decrease in the long term; (3) the fragmentation and connectivity of the landscape show that the ecological projects promote the connection between different green patches, and improves the overall connectivity of the PGPs.

In this study, the effect of ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (800 ppm) CO2 concentrations were evaluated on the C-4 xero-halophyte Kochia prostrata treated with moderate salinity (200 mM NaCl) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced osmotic stress. Our results indicated that plants grown at elevated CO2 concentration had different responses to osmotic stress and salinity. The synergistic effect of elevated CO2 and osmotic stress increased proline accumulation, but elevated CO2 did not mitigate the negative effects of osmotic stress on dark respiration intensity and photosystem II (PSII) efficiency. This indicates a stressful state, which is accompanied by a decrease in the efficiency of light reactions of photosynthesis and significant dissipative respiratory losses, thereby resulting in growth inhibition. Plants grown at elevated CO2 concentration and salinity showed high Na+ and proline contents, high water-use efficiency and time required to reach the maximum P700 oxidation level (PSI), and low dark respiration. Maintaining stable water balance, the efficient functioning of cyclic transport of PSI, and the reduction of dissipation costs contributed to an increase in dry shoot biomass (2-fold, compared with salinity at 400 ppm CO2). The obtained experimental data and PCA showed that elevated CO2 concentration improved the physiological parameters of K. prostrata under salinity.

Soil Water Dynamics with Spring Camelina in a Three-Year Rotation in Washington's Winter Wheat-Fallow Region	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Camelina [Camelina saliva (L.) Crantz] of the Brassicaceae family is a short-season drought- and frost-tolerant oilseed. Camelina has been promoted as an alternative crop for the low-precipitation (<350 mm annually) Mediterranean-like climate region of the US inland Pacific Northwest, where a monoculture 2-yr winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (WW)-summer fallow (SF) rotation is widely practiced. An 8-yr experiment was conducted to compare a 3-yr WW-camelina-SF rotation with the typical 2-yr WW-SF rotation to analyze the soil water dynamics of these two crop rotations. Growing spring-planted camelina reduced soil water content at the beginning of the fallow; this reduction resulted in an average of 21 mm less water at WW planting and a 170 kg ha(-1) reduction in grain yield compared with WW-SF. We show that (i) the deep-rooted broadleaf weed Russian thistle (Salsola tragus L.) present in camelina most years was the most likely reason for greater in-crop soil water use than with WW-SF, and (ii) the limited camelina residue was probably responsible for greater evaporative loss during the spring to late summer segment of the fallow. We report the first findings from the Pacific Northwest drylands of greater water use by a cool-season spring crop versus WW and greater evaporative loss during the summer caused by lack of residue in a minimum-tillage SF comparison. Here, extending the crop rotation to include camelina was costly in terms of water use, surface soil residue cover, soil water storage during the fallow, and WW grain yield.

Spatio-temporal temperature variations in MarkSim multimodel data and their impact on voltinism of fruit fly, <i>Bactrocera</i> species on mango	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Fruit flies are the most serious economic insect pests of mango in India and other parts of the world. Under future climate change, shifts in temperature will be a key driver of ecosystem function especially in terms of insect pest dynamics. In this study, we predicted the voltinism of the three economically important fruit fly species viz., Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), Bactrocera correcta (Bezzi) and Bactrocera zonata (Saunders) of mango from 10 geographical locations in India using well established degree day approaches. Daily minimum and maximum temperature data were generated by using seven General Circulation Models (GCMs) along with their ensemble, in conjunction with the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5) and three time periods (2020, 2050 and 2080) generated from MarkSim (R) DSSAT weather file generator. Historical data from 1969-2005 of these 10 locations were considered as baseline period. Under future predicted climates, model outputs indicates that all three fruit fly species will produce higher number of generations (1-2 additional generations) with 15-24% reduced generation time over the baseline period. The increased voltinism of fruit fly species due to increased temperature may lead to similar or equal to 5% higher infestation of mango fruits in India by the year 2050. Analysis of variance revealed that 'geographical locations' explained 77% of the total variation in voltinism followed by 'time periods' (11%). Such increase in the voltinism of fruit flies and the consequent increases in the infestation of mango fruits are likely to have significant negative impacts on mango protection and production.

Compared to flat planting without film mulching (FP), RF significantly enhances the yield and water and nitrogen (N) use efficiencies of winter wheat under the same irrigation and N inputs. However, whether RF can boost or maintain yield, water use efficiency (WUE) and N use efficiency (NUE) of winter wheat with less irrigation and N supply remains unclear. Moreover, the irrigation-saving and N reduction potential for RF under different climatic (wet, normal and drought) years is unknown. From 2013-2016, field experiments with treatments of different planting patterns (RF and FP), irrigation (0, 90 and 180 mm; represented as I0, I1 and I2, respectively) and N (0, 140 and 210 kg ha-1; represented as N0, N1 and N2, respectively) application amounts were conducted to analyze the growth and physiological characteristics, yield, WUE and NUE of winter wheat. The results showed that the leaf area index, aboveground dry matter, leaf chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate were greatest for RFI2N2 (RF with 180 mm irrigation and 210 kg N ha-1) during the whole winter-wheat growing seasons. Eventually, RFI2N2 obtained 9.3-74.1 %, 19.5-81.1 % and 23.8-92.2 % significantly greater yield than other treatments in wet and cool, normal rainfall and temperature, and drought and heat years, respectively. Relative to FPI2N2 (FP with 180 mm irrigation and 210 kg N ha-1, and FPI2N2 is local conventional agricultural management for winter wheat), the irrigation and N reduction potential for RF differed for the three levels of annual rainfall. Treatment RFI0N1 (RF with no irrigation and 140 kg N ha-1) in wet and cool, and normal rainfall and temperature years, and RFI1N1 (RF with 90 mm irrigation and 140 kg N ha-1) in drought and heat years, had almost equal winter wheat yield, and achieved significantly greater WUE and NUE than FPI2N2. In addition, in wet and cool, and normal rainfall and temperature years, RFI1N1 had 14.6-17.7 %, 5.0-10.0 % and 16.2-30.5 % significantly greater yield, WUE and NUE than RFI0N1. Therefore, RFI1N1 could be considered as a favorable management for sustainable intensification of winter wheat production in northwest China, especially in drought and heat years and in areas where water resources are relatively abundant.					chen, peng/HMD-1278-2023; fang, heng/JJE-7501-2023	fang, heng/0000-0002-4493-0926													0378-4290	1872-6852				AUG 1	2021	270								108214	10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108214		JUN 2021											WOS:000675892800001

Stephen; Sallam, Ahmed			Detailed Genetic Analysis for Identifying QTLs Associated with Drought Tolerance at Seed Germination and Seedling Stages in Barley	PLANTS-BASEL												Drought induces several challenges for plant development, growth, and production. These challenges become more severe, in particular, in arid and semiarid countries like Egypt. In terms of production, barley ranks fourth after wheat, maize, and rice. Seed germination and seedling stages are critical stages for plant establishment and growth. In the current study, 60 diverse barley genotypes were tested for drought tolerance using two different treatments: control (0-PEG) and drought (20%-PEG). Twenty-two traits were estimated for seed germination and seedling parameters. All traits were reduced under drought stress, and a significant variation was found among genotypes under control and stress conditions. The broad-sense heritability estimates were very high under both control and drought for all traits. It ranged from 0.63 to 0.97 under the control condition and from 0.89 to 0.97 under drought, respectively. These high heritabilities suggested that genetic improvement of drought tolerance in barley at both stages is feasible. The principal component analysis revealed that root-related parameters account for the largest portion of phenotypic variation in this collection. The single-marker analysis (SMA) resulted in 71 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) distributed across the seven chromosomes of barley. Thirty-three QTLs were detected for root-length-related traits. Many hotspots of QTLs were detected for various traits. Interestingly, some markers controlled many traits in a pleiotropic manner; thus, they can be used to control multiple traits at a time. Some QTLs were constitutive, i.e., they are mapped under control and drought, and targeting these QTLs makes the selection for drought tolerance a single-step process. The results of gene annotation analysis revealed very potential candidate genes that can be targeted to select for drought tolerance.

Considering limited information, it is essential to develop simulation models that can address irrigation water and N deficiencies for sugar beet production. The sugar beet simulation model (SSM) was developed for the simulation of storage root dry matter, plant-top dry matter, and the yield of white sugar under different applied N fertilizer and irrigation. The SSM simulates water, N, and soil heat flux under unsteady state conditions by applying numerical analysis in the root zone. Dry matter production and partitioning into plant top and root dry matter for different plant growth stages were simulated based on intercepted solar radiation, air temperature, and the amounts of N uptake. 2 years of field experiments data (2013 and 2014) were used to conduct model calibration and validation, respectively. In 2013, irrigation treatments were 130, 100, 85, 75, 66, and 44 percent of full irrigation, and N treatments were 0, 60, 120, and 180 kg N ha(-1) in the form of urea under line source sprinkler irrigation system. In 2014, irrigation treatments were 120, 100, 80, and 60 percent of full irrigation and N treatments were 0, 60, 120, 180, and 240 kg N ha(-1) in the form of urea under furrow irrigation system. Dry matter production was simulated according to radiation use efficiency (RUE) and was calibrated using the plant top and storage root dry matter production of treatment without water and N deficiency, which was 0.97 (g MJ(-1)). The normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) criterion was used to compare the simulation capability of the model with measured field data. White sugar yield, plant leaf area index, plant top dry matter, and storage root dry matter at harvest time and during the growing season showed acceptable NRMSE values. The values of the produced white sugar yield were simulated with NRMSE of 7.8% and 14.2% in calibration and validation data, respectively. The new and relevant information provided by the SSM was quite significant as it proved that possibility of management sugar beet under irrigation water and N deficiencies.					kamali, hamidreza/AEC-5573-2022; Zand-Parsa, Shahrokh/X-2137-2018	kamali, hamidreza/0000-0001-9596-060X; Zand-Parsa, Shahrokh/0000-0003-2594-8650													0342-7188	1432-1319				MAY	2022	40	3					337	358		10.1007/s00271-022-00769-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00271-022-00769-z		MAR 2022											WOS:000765712600001

Because of its lower impacts on soil temperature, black film mulching (BFM) is being considered as an alternative to TFM. A meta-analysis was therefore conducted to compare the benefits and trade-offs of TFM and BFM use in potato, maize, and wheat production. Overall, the plant height, aboveground biomass, water use efficiency, and yield under plastic film mulching increased by 7-17 %, 27-59 %, 20-47 %, and 17-35 %, respectively. However, film mulching shortened the crop phenology by 4-9 % due to the higher soil temperature compared with non-mulching. Compared with TFM, the mean soil temperature over the crop growing season under BFM reduced by 1.1 degrees C, which resulted in a 3-5 % increase in phenology. This is a crucial factor for BFM to increase maize yield by 6% and improve marketable tuber rate of potato by 9%, which led to higher profits, compared with TFM. In addition, no herbicide was used in BFM system, thereby eliminating the costs of herbicide and its application. As a result, the net economic benefits in BFM were 5-11 % higher than those in TFM for crop production. In conclusion, the BFM system leads to greater crop growth and higher economic benefits than the TFM system, especially for maize and potato. Policies and investment incentives that support the promotion of BFM technology should be prioritized in order to pursue these greater benefits.																			0378-4290	1872-6852				FEB 1	2021	261								108026	10.1016/j.fcr.2020.108026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2020.108026													WOS:000604576700002

Quantitative Prediction of Interactions in Bipartite Networks Based on Traits, Abundances, and Phylogeny*	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Ecological interactions link species in networks. Loss of species from or introduction of new species into an existing network may have substantial effects for interaction patterns. Predicting changes in interaction frequency while allowing for rewiring of existing interactions-and hence estimating the consequences of community compositional changes-is thus a central challenge for network ecology. Interactions between species groups, such as pollinators and flowers or parasitoids and hosts, are moderated by matching morphological traits or sensory clues, most of which are unknown to us. If these traits are phylogenetically conserved, however, we can use phylogenetic distances to construct latent, surrogate traits and try to match those across groups, in addition to observed traits. Understanding how important traits and trait matching are, relative to abundances and chance, is crucial to estimating the fundamental predictability of network interactions. Here, we present a statistically sound approach ("tapnet") to fitting abundances, traits, and phylogeny to observed network data to predict interaction frequencies. We thereby expand existing approaches to quantitative bipartite networks, which so far have failed to correctly represent the nonindependence of network interactions. Furthermore, we use simulations and cross validation on independent data to evaluate the predictive power of the fit. Our results show that tapnet is on a par with abundance-only, matching centrality, and machine learning approaches. This approach also allows us to evaluate how well current concepts of trait matching work. On the basis of our results, we expect that interactions in well-sampled networks can be well predicted if traits and abundances are the main driver of interaction frequency.

For this purpose, wheat was planted on five dates (viz., 15 November, 25 November, 5 December, 15 December, and 25 December) for three consecutive years (viz., 2014-2015, 2015-2016, and 2016-2017) with three prominent cultivars of the region (viz., RAU-3711, HD-2824, and HD-2733). Five dates of sowing represent different wheat-growing micro-environments as imposed by varying sowing dates encompassing the entire sowing window. The study observed the significant effect of sowing dates on phenophase duration. In general, with progress in the date of sowing, tiller initiation was delayed, while the reverse trend was observed for later growth phases. Sowing environments significantly influenced the number of effective tillers m-2. Average numbers of effective tillers (ET) m-2 for the wheat sown during 15-25 November were almost 11.6% higher than those of the 25 December sown crop. Grain filling duration (GFD) showed a declining trend with the advancement of sowing dates due to increased thermal load on the crop during the reproductive period. 15 November planted crop exhibited the highest GFD (47 days), which was shortened significantly beyond 25 November, signifying agrometeorological non-suitability of wheat sowing beyond this window. Wheat sown on 25 November recorded the highest grain yield (3.21 Mg ha-1), 48.61% higher than the 25 December sown crop due to the congenial thermal regime. In this context, we have identified optimal and sub-optimal conditions to escape heat stress for higher wheat productivity. Moreover, the sum of deviation of temperature from optimum thresholds, computed for sensitive growth phases (50% flowering to physiological maturity), helped us to identify heat stress and its impact on wheat. Genotype-by-environment (GGE) biplot analysis revealed that RAU-3711 was found to be the most stable cultivar. A decrease in the yield of wheat by 4.9% to 12.0%, sown during November, and 33.8% to 42.4%, sown during December, is predicted in 2050-51 and 2080-81, respectively, under RCP 4.5.

Therefore, in this study, variations in soil CO2 emissions from erosion-deposition plots were regularly monitored in China's Loess Plateau (2015-2019). The cumulative soil CO2 emissions from the depositional zones with slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 20 degrees were increased by 0.4-16.7%, 20.1-32.6%, and 31.9-51.5%, respectively, than those of their respective eroding slopes. Relative to the 5 degrees eroding slopes, the cumulative soil CO2 emissions decreased by 2.8-13.5% and 11.3-15.6% on the steeper 10 degrees and 20 degrees eroding slopes, respectively. Conversely, cumulative soil CO2 emissions increased by 1.0-7.9% and 6.9-13.3% in the depositional zones of 10 degrees and 20 degrees, respectively, as compared with that in the 5 degrees depositional zones. Considering both the eroding slopes and depositional zones, the total amount of CO2 emissions from the 10 degrees and 20 degrees erosion-deposition plots were 114 g CO2 -C y(-1) and 177 g CO2-C y(-1) lower than those from the 5 degrees erosion-deposition plots, respectively. This can be attributed to the combined effects of the amounts of runoff and sediment displacement on soil CO2 emissions from eroding slopes and depositional zones. Our results indicate that, soil erosion and deposition together have great potential to mitigate soil organic carbon mineralization and preserve soil carbon pools in slope lands. Furthermore, soil organic carbon mineralization at the slope scale is sensitive to displaced runoff and sediment. Therefore, possible variations in soil-atmospheric carbon exchanges induced by erosion-displaced runoff and sediment should be properly accounted for when attributing carbon fluxes in regions dominated by sloping landscapes.

To develop a methodology to collect information with regard to the abundance and habitat selection of sympatric large mammals using drones (unmanned aerial vehicles; UAVs) equipped with thermal infrared and red-green-blue (RGB) sensors, surveys were conducted at night and in the early morning in a high mountainous habitat. Despite the similar size and shape in thermal infrared images for sika deer and Japanese serows, species identification based on body color using RGB images was possible during the period from dawn to early morning. The UAV surveys also revealed the large abundance of deer (>40 deer/km(2)) and suggested different habitat selection between deer and serows in the alpine grassland. Our results were the first snapshots of sympathetic deer and serow distribution.

With the collected soil of sandy loam and planted shrub of S. psammophila, 16 soil boxes including bare and root-permeated soils were arranged in March 2017 and conducted in August 2017. With the wind speeds of 11 and 14 m s(-1) and rainfall intensities of 60 and 100 mm h(-1), two levels of interaction (11 m s(-1) x 60 mm h(-1) and 14 m s(-1) x 100 mm h(-1)) were designed. The particle-size composition and sediment transport flux were examined in the former wind tunnel experiments, and the runoff hydrodynamic parameters and runoff and water erosion rates were determined in the following rainfall tests. The sediment reduction effect by roots (%) was used to quantify the erosion-reducing potential of roots. The results demonstrated that in the former wind tunnel experiments, compared with the bare soils, the root-permeated soils showed a slight coarsening of surface soil and had 18.03% and 35.71% less sediment transport flux at wind speeds of 11 and 14 m s(-1), respectively. In the following rainfall tests, S. psammophila roots weakened the hydrodynamic intensity of overland flow and decreased runoff and water erosion rates by 13.34%, 30.70% and 4.44%, 43.72% at rainfall intensities of 60 and 100 mm h(-1), respectively. Different from the water erosion process of bare soils, which showed an increased fluctuated trend, the root-permeated soils presented a steady increase in the early stage of rainfall and then a decrease-stable trend at the mid and end of rainfall. In the wind tunnel-rainfall experiments, the sediment reduction effect by Salix psammophila roots showed 24.37% and 39.72% at levels of 11 m s(-1) x 60 mm h(-1) and 14 m s(-1) x 100 mm h(-1), respectively. This kind of study may provide more insights into understanding ecological impacts of sandy vegetation construction on the water-wind crisscrossed erosion region of the Chinese Loess Plateau and also sandy land.																				2296-665X				JAN 6	2023	10								1109174	10.3389/fenvs.2022.1109174	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1109174													WOS:000918790400001

Development of sequence-based markers for seed protein content in pigeonpea	MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS												Pigeonpea is an important source of dietary protein to over a billion people globally, but genetic enhancement of seed protein content (SPC) in the crop has received limited attention for a long time. Use of genomics-assisted breeding would facilitate accelerating genetic gain for SPC. However, neither genetic markers nor genes associated with this important trait have been identified in this crop. Therefore, the present study exploited whole genome re-sequencing (WGRS) data of four pigeonpea genotypes (similar to 12X coverage) to identify sequence-based markers and associated candidate genes for SPC. By combining a common variant filtering strategy on available WGRS data with knowledge of gene functions in relation to SPC, 108 sequence variants from 57 genes were identified. These genes were assigned to 19 GO molecular function categories with 56% belonging to only two categories. Furthermore, Sanger sequencing confirmed presence of 75.4% of the variants in 37 genes. Out of 30 sequence variants converted into CAPS/dCAPS markers, 17 showed high level of polymorphism between low and high SPC genotypes. Assay of 16 of the polymorphic CAPS/dCAPS markers on an F-2 population of the cross ICP 5529 (high SPC)xICP 11605 (low SPC), resulted in four of the CAPS/dCAPS markers significantly (P<0.05) co-segregated with SPC. In summary, four markers derived from mutations in four genes will be useful for enhancing/regulating SPC in pigeonpea crop improvement programs.

J	Yang, WJ; Zhang, DJ; Luo, G				Yang, Wanjing; Zhang, Daojun; Luo, Gang			A novel framework for evaluating the effect of vegetation restoration via grazing exclusion by fencing: A case-study from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Grazing exclusion by fencing (GEF) has been implemented to prevent the deterioration of grassland ecosystems in China since the beginning of this century; meanwhile, the effects have attracted widespread attention from the academic community. However, due to the simultaneity of different factors, it is difficult to separate the effect of different policies from natural resource endowments and identify the independent role of each policy. In this study, a novel framework was established based on spatiotemporal statistics. First, an indicator-denoted vegetation restoration potential achievement degree (VRPAD) was introduced to lessen the impact of resource endowment conditions. Second, a double-difference model of both space and time was developed to reflect the net improvement of VRPAD brought by GEF. The case study showed that 15 out of the 17 fenced-off enclosures achieved positive VRPAD growth since the GEF implementation, while only 58.8% showed a much faster improvement or a slower degeneration than their adjacent areas. It was also found GEF effect presented apparent administrative differences in terms of spatial distribution. The number of effective fences accounted for 75% in Mami Town, but it was 0 in Chabu Town. It is concluded that the role of GEF may be overestimated, multi-pronged approaches are more conducive to vegetation restoration, and strengthening grassroots management and self-policing of fences is important to improve GEF efficiency. This research provides a novel framework for distinguishing policy effect and is expected to inspire new ideas and methodological support for policy formulation and evaluation.

AGRONOMY-BASEL												The rapid assessment of maize yields in a smallholder farming system is important for understanding its spatial and temporal variability and for timely agronomic decision-support. We assessed the predictability of maize grain yield using unmanned aerial/air vehicle (UAV)-derived vegetation indices (VI) with (out) biophysical variables on smallholder farms. High-resolution imageries were acquired with UAV-borne multispectral sensor at four and eight weeks after sowing (WAS) on 31 farmer managed fields (FMFs) and 12 nearby nutrient omission trials (NOTs) sown with two genotypes (hybrid and open-pollinated maize) across five locations within the core maize region of Nigeria. Acquired multispectral imageries were post-processed into three VIs, normalized difference VI (NDVI), normalized difference red-edge (NDRE), and green-normalized difference VI (GNDVI) while plant height (Ht) and percent canopy cover (CC) were measured within georeferenced plot locations. Result shows that the nutrient status had a significant effect on the grain yield (and variability) in NOTs, with a maximum grain yield of 9.3 t/ha, compared to 5.4 t/ha in FMFs. Generally, there was no relationship between UAV-derived VIs and grain yield at 4WAS (r < 0.02, p > 0.1), but significant correlations were observed at 8WAS (r <= 0.3; p < 0.001). Ht was positively correlated with grain yield at 4WAS (r = 0.5, R-2 = 0.25, p < 0.001) and more strongly at 8WAS (r = 0.7, R-2 = 0.55, p < 0.001), while the relationship between CC and yield was only significant at 8WAS. By accounting for within- and between-field variations in NOTs and FMFs (separately), predictability of grain yield from UAV-derived VIs was generally low (R-2 <= 0.24); however, the inclusion of ground-measured biophysical variable (mainly Ht) improved the explained yield variability (R-2 >= 0.62, Root Mean Square Error of Prediction, RMSEP <= 0.35) in NOTs but not in FMFs. We conclude that yield prediction with UAV-acquired imageries (before harvest) is more reliable under controlled experimental conditions (NOTs), compared to actual farmer managed fields where various confounding agronomic factors can amplify noise-signal ratio.

Seed yield and oil quality as affected by Camelina cultivar and planting date	JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT												Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] has been identified as a potential oilseed crop for fallow replacement in cropping systems in the semiarid US Great Plains. However, camelina production is limited to the northern Great Plains region. We investigated the effects of three planting dates [mid-March, early-April, and mid-April] and three cultivars (Blaine Creek, Pronghorn, and Shoshone) on spring camelina seed yield and oil quality under non-irrigated conditions in western Kansas. Results showed planting in April increased seed yield by 34% compared with mid-March planting date. Blaine Creek produced greatest seed yield among the cultivars. Planting in mid-March increased oil, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and linolenic acid concentrations compared with April planting dates. Saturated fatty acid (SFA) concentration increased with an April planting date. Heat stress in the growing season reduced seed yield, oil, PUFA, linoleic, and linolenic acid concentrations. However, increase in precipitation amounts improved seed yield, oil, PUFA, and linolenic acid concentrations. Our findings showed early- to mid-April is the best-planting window for optimum spring camelina stands and seed yield in this environment.

The surface residue of crops is one of the most effective erosion control measures and it increases the soil moisture content. In some areas of the world, the management of soil surface residue (SSR) is crucial for increasing soil fertility, maintaining high soil carbon levels, and reducing the degradation of soil due to rain and wind erosion. Standard methods of measuring the residue cover are time and labor intensive, but remote sensing can support the monitoring of conservation tillage practices applied to large fields. We investigated the potential of per-pixel and object-based image analysis (OBIA) for detecting and estimating the coverage of SSRs after tillage and planting practices for agricultural research fields in Iran using tillage indices for Landsat-8 and novel indices for Sentinel-2A. For validation, SSR was measured in the field through line transects at the beginning of the agricultural season (prior to autumn crop planting). Per-pixel approaches for Landsat-8 satellite images using normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) and simple tillage index (STI) yielded coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.727 and 0.722, respectively. We developed comparable novel indices for Sentinel-2A satellite data that yielded R-2 values of 0.760 and 0.759 for NDTI and STI, respectively, which means that the Sentinel data better matched the ground truth data. We tested several OBIA methods and achieved very high overall accuracies of up to 0.948 for Sentinel-2A and 0.891 for Landsat-8 with a membership function method. The OBIA methods clearly outperformed per-pixel approaches in estimating SSR and bear the potential to substitute or complement ground-based techniques.

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Cooking time of the common bean is an important trait for consumer preference, with implications for nutrition, health, and environment. For efficient germplasm improvement, breeders need more information on the genetics to identify fast cooking sources with good agronomic properties and molecular breeding tools. In this study, we investigated a broad genetic variation among tropical germplasm from both Andean and Mesoamerican genepools. Four populations were evaluated for cooking time (CKT), water absorption capacity (WAC), and seed weight (SdW): a bi-parental RIL population (DxG), an eight-parental Mesoamerican MAGIC population, an Andean (VEF), and a Mesoamerican (MIP) breeding line panel. A total of 922 lines were evaluated in this study. Significant genetic variation was found in all populations with high heritabilities, ranging from 0.64 to 0.89 for CKT. CKT was related to the color of the seed coat, with the white colored seeds being the ones that cooked the fastest. Marker trait associations were investigated by QTL analysis and GWAS, resulting in the identification of 10 QTL. In populations with Andean germplasm, an inverse correlation of CKT and WAC, and also a QTL on Pv03 that inversely controls CKT and WAC (CKT3.2/WAC3.1) were observed. WAC7.1 was found in both Mesoamerican populations. QTL only explained a small part of the variance, and phenotypic distributions support a more quantitative mode of inheritance. For this reason, we evaluated how genomic prediction (GP) models can capture the genetic variation. GP accuracies for CKT varied, ranging from good results for the MAGIC population (0.55) to lower accuracies in the MIP panel (0.22). The phenotypic characterization of parental material will allow for the cooking time trait to be implemented in the active germplasm improvement programs. Molecular breeding tools can be developed to employ marker-assisted selection or genomic selection, which looks to be a promising tool in some populations to increase the efficiency of breeding activities.

J	Ning, JC; Zhang, DJ; Yu, Q				Ning, Jiachen; Zhang, Daojun; Yu, Qiang			Quantifying the efficiency of soil conservation and optimized strategies: A case-study in a hotspot of afforestation in the Loess Plateau	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Although it is generally believed the Grain for Green programme (GFG) implemented in China has attenuated soil erosion, the extent to which it is effective still needs verification. Taking Yan'an in the Loess Plateau as the study area, we analysed both total effect and efficiency differences during GFG implementation. Results showed that, while soil erosion on average decreased from 4,884.49 to 4,087.57 t km(-2)yr(-1), counties with higher GFG implementation intensity achieved a lower soil conservation effect. For example, Wuqi ranks third in the GFG implementation intensity among all counties in Yan'an, but its actual soil erosion reduction is the lowest, only 54.1% of Yan'an's average level. To analyse the reason for the efficiency difference, the concept of soil conservation potential was proposed. It is concluded that the soil conservation effect is controlled by the soil conservation potential. Ideally, regions with high soil conservation potential should get priority in the GFG application, yet there is a significant spatial mismatch between the GFG implementation intensity and the soil conservation potential because the correlation coefficient is only -0.05, which weakened the soil control effect. A dynamic implementation mechanism was put forward for the formulation and optimization of ecological programmes and projects in future: first, using the soil conservation potential to determine the implementation intensity in each region; second, adjusting the intensity to the changes of the soil conservation potential in the following implementation; third, repeating above steps to ensure high efficiency of soil erosion control, and achieving the sustainability and effectiveness of the ecological projects.

To understand how soil structure, OC and nutrients respond to the conversion of forest to cropland and agricultural erosion, we compared soils between forest and cropland that was established in forest 60 years ago, and among croplands suffering various intensities of erosion (from non-erosion to heavy erosion). Soil samples were collected from 0-70 cm depth for the measurement of bulk density, OC, nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P). The soil structural stability index was calculated. We showed that the conversion of forest to cropland decreased the soil structural stability and the concentrations and stocks of OC and N in the top 30 cm soils but had no effects on P. Soil erosion significantly increased soil bulk density but decreased soil structural stability and the concentrations and stocks of OC, N and P along the 0 - 70 cm soil profile. Additionally, most of the effects of erosion were enhanced with the intensity of erosion. However, OC, N and P were significantly higher at the deposition sites than at the either non-erosion or eroding sites in 15 - 70 cm soils, probably due to the burial of OC, N and P in deep soils of deposition sites. Moreover, the effects of converting forest to cropland on OC and N were greater than the effects of light erosion but smaller than the effects of moderate and heavy erosion in the top 30 cm soils. Therefore, erosion intensity should be carefully considered when disentangling the effects of converting natural ecosystem to managed ecosystem and soil erosion.

JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE												BACKGROUND In recent years, shallow-buried drip irrigation in spring maize production has gradually replaced drip irrigation under plastic films and has become a common irrigation method in semiarid areas of northern China. RESULT Two years of field experiments were carried out in the semiarid area of western Jilin province to compare the two drip irrigation methods in the spring maize production system. The treatments included MW1 (drip irrigation under mulch + moderate irrigation amount), MW2 (drip irrigation under mulch + high irrigation amount), SM1 (shallow-buried drip irrigation + moderate irrigation amount), and SM2 (shallow-buried drip irrigation + high irrigation amount). The maize yields were significantly higher under mulch than under shallow-buried drip irrigation, but there was no interaction between mulch and the irrigation amount. Drip irrigation under mulch greatly improved spring maize N, P and K uptake compared with that under shallow-buried drip irrigation. The agronomic-use efficiency, recovery-use efficiency, and partial factor productivity were ranked in the order of MW2 > MW1 > SW2 > SW1. The water-use efficiency of drip irrigation under mulch was 7.44% and 6.82% higher than that of shallow-buried drip irrigation under the moderate and high irrigation levels, respectively. However, considering the costs of the plastic mulch, there was no significant (P < 0.05) difference in economic benefits between the SW and MW treatments. CONCLUSION Drip irrigation under plastic film provides greater advantages for production, but shallow-buried drip irrigation may be a suitable method for farmers until fertigation technology is further optimized and the problem of plastic film pollution is solved.

However, most empirical evidence is from research in upland rivers spanning small spatial extents. Relatively little is known of the consequences of hydrological variation for beta diversity across multiple spatial scales in lowland rivers. Objectives We sought to examine how spatial variation in hydrology and fish beta diversity within and among rivers changed over time in response to intensification and cessation of hydrological drought. Methods We used monitoring data of fish assemblages, coupled with hydrological and biophysical data, to test how spatial variation in hydrology and multiple components of fish beta diversity in lowland rivers of the Murray-Darling Basin (Australia) varied across spatial scales during contrasting hydrological phases. Results Spatial variation in hydrology among rivers declined with increasing duration of drought before increasing during a return to above-average flows. Spatial variation in hydrology within rivers did not show consistent changes between hydrological phases. Beta diversity among and within rivers showed variable, river-specific changes among hydrological phases for both incidence- and abundance-based components of assemblage composition. Conclusions Inconsistent hydrology-beta diversity patterns found here suggest that mechanisms and outcomes of drought and flooding impacts to beta diversity are context-dependent and not broadly generalisable. Our findings indicate that hydrological fluctuations occurring in the Murray-Darling Basin in the period analysed here did not cause significant or consistent homogenisation or differentiation of freshwater fish assemblages.

J	Olave, M; Nater, A; Kautt, AF; Meyer, A				Olave, Melisa; Nater, Alexander; Kautt, Andreas F.; Meyer, Axel			Early stages of sympatric homoploid hybrid speciation in crater lake cichlid fishes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Homoploid hybrid speciation (i.e., hybrid speciation without a change in ploidy) has traditionally been considered to be rare in animals. Only few accepted empirical examples of homoploid hybrid speciation in nature exist, and in only one previous case (insects) was it convincingly shown that this process occurred in complete sympatry. Here, we report an instance of sympatric homoploid hybrid speciation in Midas cichlid fishes in Crater Lake Xiloa, Nicaragua. The hybrid lineage, albeit at an early stage of speciation, has genomically and phenotypically diverged from both of its two parental species. Together with a distinct stable isotope signature this suggests that this hybrid lineages occupies a different trophic niche compared to the other sympatric Midas cichlid species in Crater Lake Xiloa. Here, the authors present a rare example of sympatric homoploid hybrid speciation, without ploidy changes, in the Midas cichlid fishes from Nicaragua. Midas cichlid hybrids occupy a different ecological niche, likely facilitated by body shape adaptations.

Determining soil nutrient contents, including macro and micronutrients, is of crucial importance in agricultural productions. Conventional laboratory techniques for determining soil nutrients are expensive and time-consuming. This research was aimed to develop linear regression (LR) models for remote sensing of total nitrogen (TN) (mg/kg), available phosphorous (AP) (mg/kg), available potassium (AK) (mg/kg), and micronutrients such as iron (Fe) (mg/kg), manganese (Mn) (mg/kg), zinc (Zn) (mg/kg), and copper (Cu) (mg/kg) extracted by DTPA in rain-fed agricultural lands in the northwest of Iran. First, 101 soil samples were collected from 0-30 cm of these lands and analyzed for selected nutrient contents. Then a linear regression along with principal component analysis was conducted to correlate soil nutrient contents with reflectance data of different Landsat OLI bands. Finally, the spatial distributions of soil nutrients were drawn. The results showed that there were linear relationships between soil nutrient contents and standardized PC1 (Z(PC1)). The highest significant determination coefficient with an R-2 value of 0.46 and the least relative error (%) value of 11.97% were observed between TN and Z(PC1). The accuracy of the other LR's developed among other soil nutrient contents and remotely sensed data was relatively lower than that obtained for TN. According to the results obtained from this study, although remote sensing techniques may quickly assess soil nutrients, new techniques, technologies, and models may be needed to have a more accurate prediction of soil nutrients.

Exploring the responses of the arid ecosystem to the changes under different representative concentration pathways (RCPs) is of particular significance for the sustainable development of the ecosystem. In this study, the dynamics of net primary productivity (NPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency (WUE) for arid ecosystems in Tianshan North Slope are explored by running the arid ecosystem model at 25 km resolution under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. The climate in Tianshan North Slope presents a wet-warming trend during 2006-2055 under each RCP scenario with temporal and spatial heterogeneity. In response to the changes in climate and CO2, the regional annual NPP and ET increased during 2006-2055 by a respectively maximum rate of 2.15 g C m(-2) year(-1) and 0.52 mm year(-1) under RCP8.5. Both the NPP and ET share a similar temporal and spatial heterogeneity with climate change. Different vegetation types respond differently to the changes under different RCP scenarios with increasing WUE. Under each RCP, the non-phreatophyte, phreatophyte, and grass are more sensitive to the changes than in the others, and the broadleaf forest and cropland are less sensitive to the changes.

Fixed plot surveys for H. armigera larvae were carried out at 28 pigeonpea fields located in the Southern Plateau and Hills agro-climatic zone of India for three crop seasons (nine sampling weeks per season). The spatiotemporal dynamics of H. armigera larvae in the experimental area (=Hanamkonda) was analysed using geostatistics tools, namely a variogram and Voronoi diagram, and H. armigera larval distribution patterns were further characterized and mapped. RESULTS A significant difference in H. armigera larval incidence was noticed between sampling weeks, with greater larval incidence observed between 26 November and 2 December. Pod formation phenophase (Meteorological Standard Week 44) of pigeonpea favoured the initial H. armigera larval incidence. Variogram analysis revealed moderate to strong larval aggregation (spatial dependence) of H. armigera in all nine sampling weeks. Based on the range value of the variogram, the average aggregation distance of H. armigera larvae in pigeonpea was estimated to be 2425.48 m. Voronoi diagrams illustrated the spatial heterogeneity of H. armigera larva between sampling weeks, which can be linked to availability of food sources. CONCLUSION This study witnessed intrapopulation variability in H. armigera larvae associated with geographical space and temporal patterns. Based on our findings, a sampling distance of 2425.48 m may be used in larger pigeonpea fields (experimental area) to reduce scouting fatigue. The interpolated maps generated in this study may be of value in developing effective H. armigera larva monitoring and management tools in pigeonpea crop.

Predicting the population growth potential of <i>Bactrocera zonata</i> (Saunders) (Diptera: Tephritidae) using temperature development growth models and their validation in fluctuating temperature condition	PHYTOPARASITICA												Bactrocera zonata (Saunders), a serious polyphagous pest of horticultural crops, was studied for temperature based growth potential at ecologically relevant constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C; relative humidity of 60 +/- 10% and a photoperiod of 12:12 h L:D) and simulated growth potential parameters were validated with fluctuating temperatures life cycle data under laboratory conditions on artificial diet. Rate summation and cohort updating approaches were used for simulating development and estimating life-table parameters of B. zonata. The results revealed that lower development thresholds as 11.9, 12.7, and 13.6 degrees C and optimum temperature for survival as 26.01 degrees C, 26.2 degrees C and 25.5 degrees C determined for eggs, larvae and pupae, respectively. Reduction in mean development time of all immature stages occurred with increase in temperature. The highest net reproductive rate (77.64 +/- 2.59 females/female/generation), total fecundity (260.20 +/- 6.37 individuals/female/generation), intrinsic rate of increase (0.10 +/- 0.000 females/female/day) and finite rate of increase (1.10 +/- 0.000 females/female/day) were obtained maximum at 30 degrees C. At lowest extreme temperature (15 degrees C) tested in present study, females were not able to lay eggs. The temperature between 25 and 28 degrees C was the most suitable range for B. zonata reproduction and development. This shows that temperature has significant role in determining the climatic suitability for B. zonata in reproduction.					mali, santosh S/I-1602-2014; Choudhary, Jaipal/AAU-9645-2020; Choudhary, Jaipal S./AAZ-1748-2020; Das, Bikash/AAZ-2525-2020; RCER, ICAR/ABD-1024-2020	mali, santosh S/0000-0001-9058-9311; Choudhary, Jaipal/0000-0002-4475-191X; Choudhary, Jaipal S./0000-0002-4475-191X; RCER, ICAR/0000-0002-6025-3363; Das, Bikash/0000-0002-7502-4387													0334-2123	1876-7184				FEB	2020	48	1					1	13		10.1007/s12600-019-00777-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-019-00777-4													WOS:000519256300001

To find out the more promising cultivation technology to optimize water consumption characteristics and improve crop water productivity for winter wheat, a four-year field experiment in 2015-2019 was conducted in a randomized and complete block design in the Loess Plateau of northwest China. The experimental treatments: (i) whole plastic-film mulching (PFM), coverage rate was approximately 100%, (ii) straw strips mulching (SSM), including the alternating straw strip (0.5 m) and plant strip (0.35 m), and the coverage rate was 59%, (iii) conventional flat planting without mulching (CK). The obtained results showed that PFM and SSM increased the contribution rate of precipitation to evapotranspiration; inhibited evaporation but promoted transpiration to a great extent; reduced soil water storage consumption in the 0-60 cm but promoted it in the 150-200 cm soil layer; reduced soil water storage consumption at the early growth stage but promoted it at the middle growth stage compared with CK. In 2015-2019, compared with CK, PFM and SSM respectively decreased soil water consumption by 12.4% and 10.6% in the 0-60 cm soil layer, but increased it by 46.6% and 27.7% in the 150-200 cm soil layer. PFM and SSM reduced evapotranspiration by 20.1% and 14.4% before the jointing stage due to the low water consumption intensity, but increased it by 26.8% and 11.1% from jointing to blooming stage due to the high water consumption intensity. Besides, PFM and SSM respectively improved crop water productivity by 20.1% and 19.1%, improved precipitation use efficiency by 20.0% and 18.6%, and eventually increased grain yield by 18.1% and 16.5%. SSM was less effective than PFM, but taking the friendly sustainability into consideration, SSM would probably be a potential practice to develop the rainfed agriculture.

L) productivity on the Loess Plateau	PLOS ONE												Long-term chemical fertilizer input causes soil organic matter losses, structural compaction, and changes in soil water and nutrient availability, which have been subdued in the most of dry farmland in China. The concept of "more efficiency with less fertilizer input" has been proposed and is urgently needed in current agriculture. Application of chemical fertilizer combined with organic manure (OM) could be a solution for soil protection and sustainable production of dry-land maize (Zea mays. L). Field research over three consecutive years on the Loess Plateau of China was conducted to evaluate the integrated effects of chemical fertilizer strategies and additional OM input on soil nutrients availability and water use in maize. The results showed that, after harvest, soil bulk density decreased significantly with OM application, concomitant with 11.9, 18.7 and 97.8% increases in topsoil total nitrogen, organic matter, and available phosphorus contents, respectively, compared with those under equal chemicalNPKinput. Water use in the 1.0-1.5 m soil profile was improved, therefore, the soil conditions were better for maize root growth, leaf area and shoot biomass of individual maize plants increased significantly with OM application. OptimizedNPKstrategies increased grain yield and water use efficiency by 18.5 and 20.6%, respectively, compared to only chemicalNPinput. Furthermore, additional OM input promoted yield and water use efficiency by 8.9 and 5.8%, respectively. Addition of OM promotes sustainable soil and maize grain productivity as well as friendly soil environmental management of dry land farming.					yan, jiakun/GRJ-3297-2022; Chen, Yinglong/D-2104-2011; Wang, Xiaolin/AAE-3950-2021; Yan, Jiakun/AAN-5352-2020	yan, jiakun/0000-0001-8844-6098; Chen, Yinglong/0000-0003-0798-8683; Yan, Jiakun/0000-0001-8844-6098													1932-6203					AUG 25	2020	15	8							e0238042	10.1371/journal.pone.0238042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238042								32841280					WOS:000565553400014

GRAIN YIELD IN DRY LAND OF INDONESIA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Increasing soybean (Glycine max L.) production in dry land can be done through intensification using organic and inorganic fertilizer. The aim of the study was to evaluate the optimization use of organic and inorganic NPK fertilizers on soil and soybean productivity on dry land. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications on dry land in Gresik, East Java, Indonesia. The treatments evaluated were 12 dosage combinations of ZA (ammonium sulphate), SP -18 (super phosphate -18), KC1 (potassium chloride), and chicken manure. The study was conducted on dry land without and with 5,000 kg cow manure/ha. The soybean seed used in this research was Argomulyo. The results showed that (1) application of 5,000 kg cow manure/ha increased the yield of Argomulyo soybean variety by 0.21 t/ha (9%), (2) application of 100 kg KClIha + 50 kg ZA/ha + 100 kg SP-18/ha + 5,000 kg cow manure/ha, and 50 kg ZA/ha + 2,500 kg chicken manure/ha + 5,000 kg cow manure/ha increased soybean yield by 0.95-1.38 t/ha (50-74%), (3) application of 100 kg KClIha increased P uptake by 68%, Ca uptake by 60%, and Mg uptake by 54% compared to without fertilizer, (4) application of 50 kg KC1/ha + 2,500 kg chicken manure/ha increased N uptake by 48%, application of 50 kg ZA/ha + 100 kg SP-18/ha increased K uptake by 117%, and application of 50 kg ZA/ha increased Ca uptake by 60% compared without fertilizer, and (5) application of 5,000 kg cow manure/ha improved the physical properties of the soil by reducing soil bulk density by 7% and soil penetration by 37% and increasing soil permeability of 2.20 cm/hour from 1.78 cm/hour to 3.98 cm/hour. Soybean cultivation of the Argomulyo variety on dry land in Gresik requires the addition of organic cow manure 5000 kg/ha plus ZA fertilizer 50 kg/ha + chicken manure 2500 kg/ha or ZA fertilizer 50 kg/ha + SP -18 100 kg/ha + KC1 100 kg/ha to increase yield 0.95-1.38 t/ha and improve soil physical fertility. This study gives the information that the use of organic and inorganic fertilizer is an alternative technology that is required to maintain and increase the productivity of soybean and soils in dry land to support sustainable soybean cultivation.					sutrisno, Sutrisno/HSH-7813-2023	sutrisno, Sutrisno/0000-0002-5593-6784; Sudaryono, Tri/0000-0002-6020-9557													1589-1623	1785-0037					2022	20	4					3531	3549		10.15666/aeer/2004_35313549	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2004_35313549		MAY 2022											WOS:000834355300001

Recent advances in canola productivity through early sowing, understanding of critical stress periods, hybrid cultivars and improved nitrogen (N) fertilisation offer promise under many conditions but require careful adaptation for risky, low-rainfall environments. A series of eight experiments was implemented over four growing seasons (2015-18) in the low-rainfall environments of southern Australia to test combinations of sowing date, cultivar selection and N-management strategies. Simulation modelling extended the field experiment results, enabling a simple, whole-farm profit-risk analysis across growing season deciles. The aim was to identify combinations of practices where the potential production and risk were understood, thereby assisting management decisions in low-rainfall cropping systems. Earlier sowing (April) was generally beneficial but only where seasonal conditions led to successful establishment, meaning that the best fit for canola in low-rainfall environments is as an opportunity crop. A hybrid cultivar (triazine tolerant) did not provide a yield advantage in an early experiment, but productivity increases were measured with a modern hybrid cultivar (Clearfield) in a later experiment. Profit-risk analysis suggested that a yield advantage of >20% over open-pollinated cultivars needs to be sustained across the full range of season deciles to generate economic advantage. Although there was relative insensitivity to the timing of N application, an adequate dose of N, either through fertiliser or legume crops, was critical to improve canola productivity. We conclude that opportunities exist to make significant gains in yield (by up to 110% compared with current standard practice) and profit-risk outcomes (similar to 30% increased gross margins across all season types) for canola in low-rainfall environments by using a package of agronomic management decisions that includes early sowing on genuine establishment opportunities, hybrids that offer sustained yield benefits, and matching N dose from both fertiliser and legume crops to yield potential of the soil type and seasonal outlook.

Mariano			Wheat yield response to nitrogen from the perspective of intraspecific competition	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Agronomic and breeding innovations are essential to support grain production whilst avoiding over-fertilisation and excess reactive nitrogen in some agroecosystems, and chronic under-fertilisation and mining of soil organic matter in others. Based on the well-established negative correlation between yield per unit land area and intraspecific competitive ability, we hypothesised that the yield-nitrogen curve at the centre of fertiliser decisions mirrors the competition-nitrogen curve. A factorial study combining six wheat cultivars, two locations, two sowing dates and four nitrogen rates supported our hypothesis in early-sown crops where intraspecific competition for nitrogen decreased, and competition for radiation and water increased with increasing availability of nitrogen. In late-sown crops, high temperature favouring fast development, short plants and smaller canopies overrode competition for resources as the driver of grain yield. The implication is that genetic and agronomic reduction of intraspecific competition can improve yield per unit available nitrogen.

Quantitative information on the contribution of microbial necromass to soil organic carbon (SOC) formation and the factors driving necromass accumulation, decomposition and stabilization during the initial soil formation in biological crusts (biocrusts) is absent. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the composition of microbial necromass and its contributions to SOC sequestration in a biocrust formation sequence consisting of five stages: bare sand, cyanobacteria stage, cyanobacteria-moss stage, moss-cyanobacteria stage, and moss stage on sandy parent material on the Loess Plateau. The fungal and bacterial necromass C content in soil was analyzed based on amino sugars -the cell wall biomarker. Microbial necromass was an important source of SOC, and was incorporated into the particulate and mineral-associated organic C (MAOC). Because bacteria have smaller and thinner cell wall fragments as well as more proteins than fungi, bacterial necromass mainly contributed to the MAOC pool, while fungal residues remained more in the particulate organic C (POC). MAOC pool was saturated fast with the increase of microbial necromass, and POC more rapid accumulation than MAOC suggests that the clay content was the limiting factor for stable C accumulation in this sandy soil. The necromass exceeding the MAOC stabilization level was stored in the labile POC pool (especially necromass from fungi). Activities of four enzymes (i.e., beta-1,4-glucosidase, beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, leucine aminopeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase) increasing with fungal and bacterial necromass suggest that the raised activity of living microorganisms accelerated the turnover and formation of necromass. Microbial N limitation raised the production of N acquisition enzymes (e.g., beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and leucine aminopeptidase) to break down necromass compounds, leading to further increase of the nutrient pool in soil solution. The decrease of microbial N limitation along the biocrusts formation chronosequence is an important factor for the necromass accumulation during initial soil development. High microbial N demands and insufficient clay protection lead to fast necromass reutilization by microorganisms and thus, result in a low necromass accumulation coefficient, that is, the ratio of microbial necromass to living microbial biomass (on average, 9.6). Consequently, microbial necromass contribution to SOC during initial soil formation by biocrust is lower (12-25%) than in fully developed soils (33%- 60%, literature data). Nitrogen (N) limitation of microorganisms and an increased ratio between N-acquiring enzyme activities and microbial N, as well as limited clay protection, resulted in a low contribution of microbial necromass to SOC by initial formation of biocrust-covered sandy soil. Summarizing, soil development leads not only to SOC accumulation, but also to increased contribution of microbial necromass to SOC, whereas the plant litter contribution decreases.

LULC products are widely used as input for various large-scale climatic, ecological and hydrological models, but the accuracy and authenticity associated with data quality are rarely fully considered. In the study, six widely used global or national LULC datasets, MODIS-MCD12Q1, EAS CCI-LC, GlobeLand30, GLASS-GLC, CAS-CLUDs and ChinaCover, are used to assess the consistency and reliability of LULC on the Loess Plateau, where land cover has undergone major changes due to "Grain to Green" Project. Results show that MODIS and GLASS products have low quality, with the overall accuracy of 55.3-58.2% and 34.7-39.4% respectively, and the areal and spatial results cannot reflect the real changes of the Loess Plateau. Large areas of croplands in MODIS-MCD12Q1 are classified as natural grassland. Croplands in GLASS-GLC are overestimated in the central parts of the Loess Plateau. Both of MODIS and GLASS products are hard to separate woodlands from grasslands. ESA CCI-LC has higher classification accuracy (73.9%-74.2%) than the released MODIS and GLASS products. The woodlands in ESA CCI-LC is relatively underestimated than that of CAS-CLUD and ChinaCover, and the conversion feature from cropland to forest and grasses is almost absent on ESA CCI-LC maps. Although GlobeLand30 has a high overall accuracy at 86. 6-86.7%, it is inadequate to get the characteristic of returning of cropland to forest and grasses. The most similar land covers are CAS-CLUDs and ChinaCover, which are considered to have highest classification accuracy ranging from 89.4% to 91.6% and can reflect the actual LULC status and its changes on the Loess Plateau. A blending LULC dataset is developed and the overall accuracies for all classes can be improved by 1.63-7.49%.

The microbial decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) is a major source of carbon loss, especially in ecologically fragile regions (e.g., the Tibetan Plateau), which are also affected by global warming and anthropogenic activities (e.g., fertilization). The inherent differences between bacteria and fungi indicate that they are likely to play distinct roles in the above processes. However, there still have been no reports on that, which is restricting our knowledge about the mechanisms underlying SOC decomposition. Methods. A long-term nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) addition field experiment was conducted to assess their effects on soil microbial, fungal, and bacterial respiration (RM, RF, and RB, respectively) and temperature sensitivity (Q10; at 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 35 degrees C) using cycloheximide and streptomycin to inhibit the growth of fungi and bacteria. Results. We found that N suppressed RM and RF at all temperatures, but RB was only suppressed at 15 degrees C, regardless of the addition of P. The addition of N significantly decreased the ratio of RF/RM at 35 degrees C, and the combined NP treatment increased the Q10 of RB but not that of RF. Results of the redundancy analysis showed that variations in soil respiration were linked with NO3--N formation, while the variations in Q10 were linked with SOC complexity. Long-term N addition suppressed RM by the formation of NO3--N, and this was mediated by fungi rather than bacteria. The contribution of fungi toward SOC decomposition was weakened by N addition and increasing temperatures. Combined NP addition increased the Q10 of RB due to increased SOC complexity. The present study emphasizes the importance of fungi and the soil environment in SOC decomposition. It also highlights that the role of bacteria and SOC quality will be important in the future due to global warming and increasing N deposition.					xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023														2167-8359					FEB 24	2022	10								e12851	10.7717/peerj.12851	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12851								35233293					WOS:000766803900004

However, the fate of soil organic carbon (SOC) in low-order stream systems is still uncertain due to the complex influences of terrain, land uses, and anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we used the geochemical properties fingerprinting method and a radiocarbon-based two-member mixing model to clarify the source, budgets, and composition of SOC in a low-order stream catchment in the Yellow River basin. The results showed that the primary source of SOC in the catchment was agricultural activity area, which accounted for 68.5%. After vegetation restoration, the SOC delivery rate and loss rate decreased from 0.38 +/- 0.06 to 0.26 +/- 0.04 and 0.19 +/- 0.06 to 0.14 +/- 0.04 t center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1), respectively. The SOC mobilized by soil erosion in the source area was 1,085.8 +/- 170.5 t from 1969 to 2015, and the SOC lost during the transport process was 552.9 +/- 170.1 t. The lost carbon was dominated by OCbio, whereas the loss of OCpetro was minimal. Soil erosion can mobilize the OCpetro sequestered in terrestrial ecosystems and deliver it to a river system if it is not intercepted. The oxidation of OCpetro during long-distance fluvial transport may represent a significant carbon source for atmospheric CO2 on a geological timescale. This study contributes to our understanding of the carbon sink/source issue and quantifies the SOC budgets in stream systems.

J	Wang, HF; Wang, L; Ren, TS				Wang, Hengfei; Wang, Li; Ren, Tusheng			Long-term no tillage alleviates subsoil compaction and drought-induced mechanical impedance	INTERNATIONAL AGROPHYSICS												Ab s tr a c t. No tillage was introduced to Northeast China to prevent the soil degradation caused by conventional tillage sys-tems. However, there are concerns that no tillage will result in soil mechanical impedance. In this study, we investigated the effects of conventional tillage and no tillage on soil strength properties using a long-term field study initiated in 2011 on a silt clay loam soil. In 2018 and 2019, soil bulk density, water content, the degree of compactness, and penetrometer resistance were measured before tillage and after planting, and also, the changes in soil profile water content and penetrometer resistance were monitored during dry-ing periods. Results showed that conventional tillage led to the formation of a compacted zone beneath the cultivated layer, with higher bulk density, degree of compactness, and penetrometer resistance values. After converting from conventional tillage to no tillage for 8 to 9 years, the bulk density, penetrometer resistance, and degree of compactness were increased to a moderate extent in the topsoil but were lowered in the subsurface soil. During drying periods, as compared to conventional tillage plots, the no tillage plots maintained higher water contents, which resulted in lower penetrometer resistances below a 15 cm depth and the later arrival of the threshold penetrometer resistance of 2 MPa.

This study was conducted for a period of 3 years in Central Anatolia region of Turkey to find out how the energy balance was affected under different planting methods. Split plot design with four replications was used in the study. While the main plots included planting methods, the subplots included the varieties. Energy use efficiency, energy productivity, specific energy and net energy were investigated. According to the results obtained, energy inputs were found to be lower in bed planting (26.38 GJ ha(-1)), when compared with conventional flat planting (26.51 GJ ha(-1)). Energy use efficiency was found to be higher in conventional flat planting (7.15) when compared with bed planting (5.39). While grain yield (GY), biomass yield (BY) and number of spikes m(2)(NS) were found to be higher with conventional flat planting, harvest index (HI) and thousand kernel weight (TKW) were found to be higher with bed planting. It was concluded that the variety chosen was extremely important in the success of bed planting method.

Two backcross populations (BC2F5) were developed using the elite cultivar Cierzo as the recurrent parent. The donor parents, namely SBCC042 and SBCC073, were selected from the SBCC lines due to their outstanding yield in drought environments. Flowering time, yield and drought-related traits were evaluated in two field trials in Zaragoza (Spain) during the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons and validated in the 2017-18 season. Two hundred sixty-four lines of each population were genotyped with the Barley lllumina iSelect 50k SNP chip. Genetic maps for each population were generated. The map for SBCC042 x Cierzo contains 12,893 SNPs distributed in 9 linkage groups. The map for SBCC073 x Cierzo includes 12,026 SNPs in 7 linkage groups. Both populations shared two QTL hotspots. There are QTLs for flowering time, thousand-kernel weight (TKW), and hectoliter weight on a segment of 23 Mb at similar to 515 Mb on chromosome 1H, which encompasses the HvFT3 gene. In both populations, flowering was accelerated by the landrace allele, which also increased the TKW. In the same region, better soil coverage was contributed by SBCC042 but coincident with a lower hectoliter weight. The second large hotspot was on chromosome 6H and contained QTLs with wide intervals for grain yield, plant height and TKW. Landrace alleles contributed to increased plant height and TKW and reduced grain yield. Only SBCC042 contributed favorable alleles for "green area," with three significant QTLs that increased ground coverage after winter, which might be exploited as an adaptive trait of this landrace. Some genes of interest found in or very close to the peaks of the QTLs are highlighted. Strategies to deploy the QTLs found for breeding and pre-breeding are proposed.

Vara			Water storage and use efficiencies of rainfed winter wheat-summer green manure systems of the US Southern Great Plains	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Conservation practices such as green manures and no-tillage can reduce soil erosion, enhance soil biological activity, increase water storage in soils, and provide nitrogen (N) in support of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). However, green manures utilize soil water during the summer months, and such water depletion may negatively impact production by wheat in ecoregions with limited water resources. This 5-year study quantified the impacts of tillage systems and green manures on water storage efficiency (WSE) during summer, water use efficiency (WUE), and grain yield of winter wheat. The study was conducted during 2011-2016 in the United States (US) Southern Great Plains (SGP). Three legumes as green manures (cowpea, pigeon pea, and soybean) were compared with summer fallow and three levels of applied inorganic N (0, 45 and 90 kg N ha-1) at wheat planting, under conventional and no-till cultivation. Summer WSE was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in response to green manures; summer fallow was also inefficient in storing soil water. Grain yield and WUE of wheat were reduced in response to green manures compared to summer fallow during dry years but there were no differences during wet or normal rainfall years. No till significantly increased WSE under all treatments, and reduced evapotranspiration during a subset (either summer or wheat growing season) of years but did not affect amounts of soil water. Our results demonstrate replacing summer fallow in continuous systems of winter wheat with green manures have limited effects on improving water availability or efficiencies in water use by wheat. More-effective approaches for using green manures to support winter wheat in the SGP include opportunity cropping during years with adequate moisture to support double-cropping or utilizing more water-efficient le-gumes or cropping systems.

The objective of this study was to assess GEI for grain yield in foxtail millet cultivars grown in northwest China and identify promising genotypes and representative seed production environments. The study used 12 genotypes in eight environments, representative of early-maturing growing areas. Additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype and genotype by environment (GGE) biplot analysis were used to analyze the data. AMMI analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that genotype (G), environment (E), and GEI effects were highly significant (p < 0.01), with contributions to total observed variation of 19.5%, 43.4%, and 28.6%. Six stability parameters based on AMMI were used to analyze yielding stability. YG35, FH9, DT29, and ZZG21 were more stable. The correlation coefficients between the six parameters were > 0.8. Subsequently, genotypes YG35, ZZG21, and DT29 were identified as stable and high yield potential based on genomic selection index (GSI). GGE biplot analysis revealed the same cultivars (YG35, ZZG21, and DT29) as the best performers for being closest to the ideal cultivar. The test sites were classified into two mega-environments using GGE biplot analysis for genotype assessment and seed production. Chifeng (CF) and Wulumuqi (XJ) were identified as the closest to the ideal test site, with relatively strong discriminatory ability and representativeness. Therefore, the findings of this study provide insights for the regional planting and breeding of foxtail millet in the future.

The evolution of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPERs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) during laccase-catalyzed lignin decomposition remains unclear. Characterization by electron para-magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed gradually increased concentration of EPERs, with maximum levels within 6 h that remained constant, accompanied by the increase in g-factor from 2.0037 to 2.0041. The results suggested the generation of oxygen-centered radicals on lignin. The EPERs produced on solid samples slowly decreased by 17.2% over 17 d. ROS were also detected to have a similar trend as that of the evolution of EPERs. Scanning electron microscopy, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses suggested the demethylation and oxidation of lignin. We clarify the biogeochemical transformation of lignin and potential contributions to the generation of EPERs and ROS in soil. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and methods The test plot consisted of seven treatments with an area of 5 m x 6 m (30 m(2)) each, and each treatment included three replicates. The plot was filled with raw soil (old wall soil) from an abandoned homestead in Yuzihe Village, Yaotou Town, Chengcheng County, Shaanxi Province, China. The test design was completely randomised with seven treatments: fly ash (T1), organic fertiliser (chicken manure) (T2), improver (ferrous sulphate) (T3), fly ash+organic fertiliser (T4), improver+organic fertiliser (T5), fly ash+improver (T6) and no fertilisation measures (T0). The modified materials were mixed evenly with raw soil then applied to a depth of 0-30 cm onto the test plot. Results and discussion After adding the various modified materials, the soil bulk density decreased by 6.52-14.49% and total soil porosity, capillary porosity and non-capillary porosity increased by 7.09-15.75%, 3.14-12.67% and 15.57-38.47%, respectively. The soil permeability coefficient increased by 5.75-10.75x. Organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium in reclaimed hollow village soil increased by 12.50-66.44%, 15.15-20.00%, 6.58-64.62% and 18.24-26.82%, respectively, relative to that of T0. Only T4, T2, T6 and T5 significantly increased maize yield and water use efficiency compared with T0. The other treatments did not significantly improve maize yield or water use efficiency. Conclusions Organic fertiliser and fly ash composite was an appropriate amendment for improving reclaimed soil in a hollow village in a loess hilly gully region.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				MAY	2019	19	5					2374	2380		10.1007/s11368-019-02246-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-019-02246-1													WOS:000464836300021

This method, which is applicable at the local scale, employs a model of the surface heat budget to estimate the spatial distribution of thermal inertia-derived soil moisture (TISM) and an analytical footprint model to estimate dust source areas. It incorporates readily available satellite and meteorological data. The soil moisture inside the dust source area is estimated for individual dust phenomena observed at a synoptic surface observation site, and then, together with the corresponding observed wind speed, the threshold wind speed as a function of soil moisture is found by employing the parametrization of Fecan et al. (Ann Geophys 17:149-157, 1999). This relationship represents the local dust climatology at the observation site, although the data include some outliers. The results show that readily available data for the natural environment can be used, as an alternative to wind-tunnel data, with the parametrization used to derive the threshold wind-speed relation. The derived relation indicates the TISM and wind speed at which the probability of a dust phenomenon is 10%. Moreover, the threshold wind-speed results are not sensitive to the principal footprint-model parameters. The TISM standard error of approximately 0.04 m(3) m(-3) could significantly affect the results under dry and weak-wind conditions, but this sensitivity can be avoided if the soil clay content or the soil type at the observation point is known.

Here we examined the fine root (<= 1.0 mm in diameter) distribution and morphological characteristics of switchgrass (Panicum virgatumL.) in the 7(th)growth year under three row spacing settings (20 cm, 40 cm and 60 cm) on a terrace field in the semi-arid Loess Plateau region. Roots from 0 to 150 cm soil layers were utilized to evaluate the root biomass, distribution and morphological traits in April and October 2016. Results showed that fine root biomass (FRB) mainly distributed in the 0-40 cm soil layer, and it was higher under the 20 cm and 40 cm than that under the 60 cm row spacing treatment. FRB in October was lower than in April under all three row spacings. Compared with 20 cm and 60 cm row spacing, root surface area, root length density and specific root length under 40 cm row spacing were higher, while root diameter was smaller.

Combining Planting Patterns with Mulching Bolsters the Soil Water Content, Growth, Yield, and Water Use Efficiency of Spring Wheat under Limited Water Supply in Arid Regions	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Innovations in water-saving cultivation strategies are urgently needed to achieve high yield and elevated water use efficiency (WUE) simultaneously in arid regions with limited water resources. Here, we conducted a two-year field study to compare the impacts of eight combinations of planting patterns (PPs) and mulching on the soil water content (SWC) in the top 60 cm soil layer, the growth, the yield, and the WUE of wheat under two irrigation rates (1.00 and 0.50 ET). These combinations included three conventional flat planting (CF) patterns, including CF without mulch (CFNM), with plastic film (CFPM), and with wheat straw mulch (CFSM); three raised-bed planting (RB) patterns, including RB without mulch (RBNM), with plastic film (RBPM), and wheat straw (RBSM) mulch; and two ridge-furrow planting (RF) patterns, including RF without mulch (RFNM) and with plastic film mulch (RFPM). The results showed that the tested treatments affected the SWC at different depths under both irrigation rates. Compared with the two non-mulched treatments under 0.50 ET, the SWC of the three PPs with plastic film and the two PPs with wheat straw mulching were significantly higher before irrigation by 14.4-22.0% and 6.9-17.2% at 0-20 cm soil depth, 16.4-29.0% and 6.6-14.9% at 20-40 cm soil depth, and 3.3-34.8% and 3.4-14.5% at 40-60 cm soil depth, respectively. All measured wheat parameters, except harvest index, were significantly affected by the interaction between irrigation rate and PPs. The highest values for plant dry weight (PDW), yield components, grain yield (GY), and WUE under 1.00 ET were obtained in the two PPs with wheat straw mulch, while the three PPs with plastic film showed the highest values of these parameters under 0.50 ET. The yield response factor (Ky) based on PDW was acceptable for all PPs mulched with plastic film and wheat straw as well as for RFNM, while Ky based on GY was acceptable only for the PPs mulched with plastic film and for RFNM, as the Ky values of these PPs were less than 1 under 0.50 ET. The SWC at different depths exhibited quadratic and nonsignificant relationships with all parameters under 1.00 ET, while these relationships were linear and strong under 0.50 ET, with a few exceptions. Overall, we conclude that combining any PPs with plastic film mulching could be used as a feasible and effective strategy for obtaining high wheat yield and WUE in the irrigated and arid agroecosystem.

Only the land-surface parts of hydrological cycles are directly visible and represented in local knowledge and water-related legislation. Human impacts on water cycles (HIWC) can, beyond climate change, arise through effects on local and regional hydrological processes, from both reduced and increased water use compared to a natural reference vegetation with which landscape structure and hydrology are aligned. Precipitationsheds, the oceanic and terrestrial origin of rainfall, depend on evapotranspiration and thus on vegetation. The political commitment to reduce agricultural impact on nature requires hydrological mimetrics to trickle down through institutions to actions. Existing metrics do not suffice. For example, the water footprint metric that relates agricultural water use to consumption decisions, suggests minimizing water use is best, ignoring full hydrological impacts. We explore principles, criteria and indicators for understanding HIWC, via modified evapotranspiration, effects on streamflow (downstream impacts) and atmospheric fluxes and precipitation (downwind impacts). Comprehensive HIWC mimetrics for a set of pantropical watersheds suggest hydrological mimicry options for forest-derived land use patterns through intermediate densities of trees with diversity in rooting depth and water use, interacting with soils, crops and livestock.

Belowground responses to altered precipitation regimes in two semi-arid grasslands	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Predicted climate change extremes, such as severe or prolonged drought, may considerably impact carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in water-limited ecosystems. However, we lack a clear and mechanistic understanding of how extreme climate change events impact ecosystem processes belowground. This study investigates the effects of five years of reoccurring extreme growing season drought (66% reduction, extreme drought treatment) and two-month delay in monsoon precipitation (delayed monsoon treatment) on belowground productivity and biogeochemistry in two geographically adjacent semi-arid grasslands: Chihuahuan Desert grassland dominated by Bouteloua eriopoda and Great Plains grassland dominated by B. gracilis. After five years, extreme drought reduced belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) in the Chihuahuan Desert grassland but not in the Great Plains grassland. Across both grasslands, extreme drought increased soil pH and available soil nutrients nitrate and phosphate. The delayed monsoon treatment reduced BNPP in both grasslands. However, while available soil nitrate decreased in the Chihuahuan Desert grassland, the delayed monsoon treatment overall had little effect on soil ecosystem properties. Extreme drought and delayed monsoon treatments did not significantly impact soil microbial biomass, exoenzyme potentials, or soil C stocks relative to ambient conditions. Our study demonstrates that soil microbial biomass and exoenzyme activity in semi-arid grasslands are resistant to five years of extreme and prolonged growing season drought despite changes to soil moisture, belowground productivity, soil pH, and nutrient availability.

Estimating the potential of spices for mineral provision in a refugee context in East Africa	SN APPLIED SCIENCES												Micronutrient deficiency remains an enormous problem in refugee settings. Transforming refugees' food systems through the scaling up of kitchen gardening and fortifying relief food crops with minor food components including nutrient-dense spices can help improve the quality of staple foods. Globally, spices are indispensable in the daily diet and play an important role in the socio-cultural setting of different communities. Forty turmeric and curry powder samples were collected from different market establishments and geographic locations in East Africa. The samples were analyzed for selected elements using Portable X-Ray Fluorescence (PXRF). The contents of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) and strontium (Sr) in turmeric powder were statistically different among geographic origins (Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda). We also aimed to determine if a small portion of spices (turmeric (5 g) and curry (4 g)) would contribute to an adequate intake (AI) or recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for selected minerals, for refugee men and women aged between 19 and 50 years as defined by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine (IOM). For the reference groups, the contributions of turmeric and curry powder to AI/RDA for K, Ca and Zn varied between 0.48 to 4.13%. On the other hand, turmeric was identified to contribute > 20% AI/RDA for refugee men and women aged between 19 and 50 years for two micro minerals: manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe). Considering turmeric and curry powder of East African origins are good sources of minerals and present acceptable toxic metal(loid)s loads coupled with low cost, these spices particularly turmeric should be more widely popularized and recommended for food-to-spice fortification among the refugee population located in East Africa.																			2523-3963	2523-3971				JAN	2023	5	1								10.1007/s42452-022-05224-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42452-022-05224-4													WOS:000912890800001

These changes present severe challenges to water resource utilization and ecological development. Variation of run-off, suspended sediment load (SSL), and eight precipitation indices (P1: 0-12mm.day(-1), P12: 12-25mm.day(-1), P25: 25-50mm.day(-1), P50: P50mm.day(-1) and corresponding rainfall day: Pd1, Pd12, Pd25, Pd50dayyear(-1)) in three critical parts of the Yellow River basin (source region: SRYRB, upper reaches: URYRB, middle reaches: MRYRB) were investigated for the period from 1960 to 2015. The results show that run-off and SSL significantly decreased (P<0.01) in the URYRB and the MRYRB, whereas their decline in the SRYRB was insignificant (P>0.05). Moreover, run-off in the URYRB had one change point in 1987, and SSL in the URYRB as well as run-off and SSL in the MRYRB had two change points (in the 1970s and the 1990s). Over the same period, only Pd1 and Pd12 in the SRYRB showed significant increasing trends, and an abrupt change appeared in 1981. The optimal precipitation indices for assessing the effects of precipitation on run-off and SSL in the URYRB and MRYRB were Pd50 and P12, respectively. A double-mass curve analysis showed that precipitation and human activities contributed to approximately 20% and 80% of the reduction in run-off, respectively, for both the SRYRB and the MRYRB. However, the contribution rate of precipitation and human activities on SSL reduction was approximately 40% and 60% in the URYRB and 5% and 95% in the MRYRB, respectively. Human activities, primarily soil and water conservation measures and water extraction (diversion), were the main factors (>50%) that reduced the run-off. However, the dominant driving factors for SSL reduction were soil and water conservation measures and reservoir interception, for which the contribution rate was higher than 70% in the MRYRB. This work strengthens the understanding of hydrological responses to precipitation change and provides a useful reference for regional water resource utilization.

Willem; Hughes, Justin; Trotter, Luca; Neal, Brad; Cartwright, Ian; Nathan, Rory			Explaining changes in rainfall-runoff relationships during and after Australia's Millennium Drought: a community perspective	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The Millennium Drought lasted more than a decade and is notable for causing persistent shifts in the relationship between rainfall and runoff in many southeastern Australian catchments. Research to date has successfully characterised where and when shifts occurred and explored relationships with potential drivers, but a convincing physical explanation for observed changes in catchment behaviour is still lacking. Originating from a large multi-disciplinary workshop, this paper presents and evaluates a range of hypothesised process explanations of flow response to the Millennium Drought. The hypotheses consider climatic forcing, vegetation, soil moisture dynamics, groundwater, and anthropogenic influence. The hypotheses are assessed against evidence both temporally (e.g. why was the Millennium Drought different to previous droughts?) and spatially (e.g. why did rainfall-runoff relationships shift in some catchments but not in others?). Thus, the strength of this work is a large-scale assessment of hydrologic changes and potential drivers. Of 24 hypotheses, 3 are considered plausible, 10 are considered inconsistent with evidence, and 11 are in a category in between, whereby they are plausible yet with reservations (e.g. applicable in some catchments but not others). The results point to the unprecedented length of the drought as the primary climatic driver, paired with interrelated groundwater processes, including declines in groundwater storage, altered recharge associated with vadose zone expansion, and reduced connection between subsurface and surface water processes. Other causes include increased evaporative demand and harvesting of runoff by small private dams. Finally, we discuss the need for long-term field monitoring, particularly targeting internal catchment processes and subsurface dynamics. We recommend continued investment in the understanding of hydrological shifts, particularly given their relevance to water planning under climate variability and change.

Asymmetric responses of biocrust respiration to precipitation manipulation under a changing semiarid climate	GEODERMA												Global climate change is expected to cause both increased and reduced precipitation in the next decades, especially in drylands with semi-arid climates. Biocrusts are an essential soil surface cover in global drylands, and they strongly influence most soil properties and support fundamental ecosystem functions, especially soil carbon (C) cycling. Nevertheless, the response patterns and mechanisms of biocrust respiration rate (Rs) to precipitation changes remain uncertain under changing semi-arid climates. In our study, a field experiment for biocrusts with natural precipitation (CK) and six levels of precipitation manipulation (-50 %, -30 %, -10 %, +10 %, +30 %, and +50 % of CK) were conducted from 2019 to 2021 in a semi-arid climate region of the northern Chinese Loess Plateau. We continuously measured the biocrust Rs of all the treatments in the growing seasons, and the fundamental properties of biocrusts and their temperature and water content at 5 cm depth were also measured. Our results showed that the increased precipitation inhibited biocrust Rs, while moderately reduced precipitation stimulated biocrust Rs. As compared with the CK, the precipitation manipulations of +10 %, +30 %, and +50 % decreased biocrust Rs by 8.9 %, 15.3 %, and 22.1 %, respectively, while the treatments of -10 % and -30 % increased biocrust Rs by 25.5 % and 8.0 %, respectively. However, the precipitation manipulation of -50 % suppressed biocrust Rs by 19.3 %. More importantly, the responses of biocrust Rs to precipitation changes were negative and asymmetric, which indicated a higher sensitivity of biocrust Rs to reduced precipitation in comparison to increased precipitation. Moreover, the increased precipitation (+10 % to + 50 %) raised soil water content (by 29.7 %-55.0 %), moss biomass (by 12.5 %-50.0 %), and organic matter content (by 11.3 %-12.4 %). In contrast, the reduced precipitation (-10 % to -30 %) decreased soil water content (by 5.2 %-17.6 %) and moss biomass (by 12.5 %-25.8 %). The structural equation modeling analysis showed that the responses of biocrust Rs to precipitation manipulation were mainly and directly influenced by soil temperature and biocrust properties. Although soil water content did not have a direct significant effect on biocrust Rs, it indirectly influenced biocrust Rs by affecting the fundamental properties of soil and biocrusts. Consequently, the changed soil properties and biocrust characteristics caused by precipitation shifts aggravated the negative responses of biocrust Rs to precipitation manipulation. Our findings emphasize that biocrusts have a negative and asymmetric response of Rs to precipitation changes, implying that the intensified precipitation variation in semi-arid regions caused by global climate change in future may positively affect the stability of soil C stocks contributed by biocrusts and thus reduce soil C efflux in drylands.

Effect of drought stress on agro-morphological traits in sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>L.) genotypes and identification of informative ISSR markers	PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES-CHARACTERIZATION AND UTILIZATION												The aims of the current study were to investigate the effect of drought stress on phenological and morphological traits of sunflower genotypes and to determine the important traits for identifying drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive cultivars. For this purpose, a lattice square-design experiment was conducted with 64 sunflower genotypes in an 8 x 8 pattern with two replications under non-stress and moisture-stress conditions (irrigation holding at the flowering stage) during 2 years 2016 and 2017. Measured and recorded traits were included the some phenological and morphological traits seeds. Sil-96 genotype showed the highest yield under both non-stress and moisture-stress conditions. Among the morphological traits, the head and stem diameters were highly significant to determine the final yield. In comparing the genotypes, it was concluded that the number of seeds per head was the most influential component affecting the yield. Furthermore, 1000-seed weight was the most important factor affecting grain yield under moisture-stress conditions. The result of association analysis study shows that 45 of inter-simple sequence repeat markers in a general linear model are associated with yield and yield component traits and 23 of them were verified in a mixed linear model (MLM) association approach. Also, 32 markers were informative for morpho-physiological traits and 24 of them verified using the MLM. Finally, 19 informative markers were identified for phenological traits and 10 of them were verified by the MLM.

In an effort to stem the progression of desertification, shrubs such as Salix cupularis have been planted in some localities in this region. However, the mechanisms whereby the interspecific relationships between these shrubs and the undergrowth vegetation change in response to an increase in shrub canopy area remain unclear. In this study, we examined the traits of plant communities and analysed soil samples under S. cupularis in a degraded alpine meadow along a gradient of four different canopy areas (1.3-1.8, 3.8-5.5, 12.6-14.5, and 27.3-28.3 m(2)). Our results revealed that plant community characteristics shifted from facilitation to competition at a canopy area of 3.8-5.5 m(2). However, changes in soil nutrients and the activities of sucrase and catalase were not detected until the canopy area of S. cupularis had reached 2.6-14.5 m(2). Furthermore, we found that microbial communities, particularly bacteria, showed trends similar to those shown by soil properties. In line with expectations, we found that the soil fungal community showed trends opposite to those shown by the bacterial community. Our findings highlight that competition rather than facilitation tends to be the predominant interspecific relationship that develops in response to the continued growth of nurse plants. Consequently, these results provide evidence in support of the stress-gradient hypothesis, which states that interspecific competition is particularly prevalent in fertile environments, particularly when there are changes in facilitation during periods of increasing environmental stress. Importantly, with respect to the shift in interspecific relationships from facilitative to competitive, we demonstrate that the response of the belowground interactions was slower than that of interactions above ground. Collectively, our observations indicate that the nurse effect of S. cupularis on ecosystems could have significant implications for the restoration of desertified grasslands.

Evidence from Rural Ethiopia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS												We study how the introduction of a formal index insurance product affects informal risk-sharing among pastoralists in southern Ethiopia. Using detailed social networks data, randomized incentives to purchase the insurance product, and hypothetical informal transfer data that mirror the existing customary arrangements, we find respondents' own formal insurance uptake has no significant effect on their willingness to share risk through customary institutions. We also find weak evidence that a randomly matched peer's insurance uptake positively influences respondents' willingness to make informal transfers to that match. Overall, our results imply that in this context index insurance does not crowd out informal risk-sharing mediated by social networks.																			0002-9092	1467-8276				APR	2019	101	3					672	691		10.1093/ajae/aay042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aay042													WOS:000480792300003

Hori, severely affects groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) production worldwide. Breeding for resistant varieties using conventional breeding is difficult because multiple genes control the resistance and heritability is moderate. Our objective was to identify marker-trait associations (MTAs) for ELS resistance in a mini-core collection of 168 accessions. The accessions were genotyped using diversity array technology (DArTseq (TM)) and phenotyped at two locations with and without inoculation. Two types of DArTseq markers were scored; Silico DArT markers and biallelic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Genotype effects were significant for both ELS and pod weight (PW), with several accessions showing good levels for resistance. The heritability of ELS was moderate (0.37 to 0.64), whereas heritability for PW was low (0.10 to 0.18). The DArTseq generated 3592 biallelic SNP markers and 15,237 dominant silico markers. The distribution of the biallelic and dominant markers across the genome shows that chromosomes B04 and A04 had the highest number of markers. The MTA analysis revealed 25 significant (p < 0.001) MTAs. One MTA for ELS was found across treatments and rating dates and may be suitable for marker-assisted selection upon validation. No MTA for PW was repeatable. The germplasm and markers identified in this study can serve as useful genomic resources to initiate marker-assisted selection and trait introgression for ELS resistance in groundnut.

The stem wood, stem bark, branch, foliage, and belowground biomass of each of the 20 destructive harvesting trees were quantified. The mean total biomass of each tree was 28.8, 106.8, 380.6, and 603.4 kg/tree in the 14-, 31-, 46-, and 63-year-old stands, respectively. Aboveground biomass accounted for 72.25%, 73.05%, 76.14%, and 80.37% of the total tree biomass in the 14-, 31-, 46-, and 63-year-old stands, respectively, and stem wood was the major component of tree biomass. The proportion of stem (with bark) biomass to total tree biomass increased with stand age while the proportions of branch, foliage, and belowground biomass to total tree biomass decreased with stand age. The ratio of belowground biomass to aboveground biomass decreased from 0.39 in the 14-year-old stand to 0.37, 0.31, and 0.24 in the 31-, 46-, and 63-year-old stands, respectively. Age-specific biomass equations in each stand were developed for stem wood, stem bark, aboveground, and total tree. The inclusion of tree height as a second variable improved the total tree biomass equation fitting for middle-aged (31-year-old and 46-year-old) stands but not young (14 years old) and mature (63 years old) stands. Moreover, biomass conversion and expansion factors (BCEFs) varied with stand age, showing a decreasing trend with increasing stand age. These results indicate that stand age alters the biomass allocation of Q. acutissima and results in age-specific allometric biomass equations and BCEFs. Therefore, to obtain accurate estimates of Q. acutissima forest biomass and carbon stocks, age-specific changes need to be considered.

This study attempted to investigate the spatial-temporal variation of sediment load in the Wei River basin in the midstream of the Yellow River during 1961-2015 at 15 hydrological stations. The results indicated that annual sediment load in the past six decades decreased significantly (P < 0.01) with the changing trends of-6.43 x 10(4),-3.86 x 10(4),-4.6 x 10(4) t/a at Xianyang, Zhangjiashan, and Zhuangtou stations, respectively. Annual sediment load exhibited abrupt changes in the mid-1990s, which were largely attributed to the strong effects of soil conservation mea-sures in the study area. The spatial pattern of soil erosion were characterized by high sediment yield in the north with sparse vegetation cover and well-developed gullies, and low sediment yield in the south with flat plain and good vegetation cover in the Wei River basin. The results of the partial least squares-structural equation model (PLS-SEM) showed that vegetation changes and rainfall variability explained 62.3%, 47.3%, and 40.1% of the variation in runoff at Xianyang, Zhuangtou, and Zhangjiashan stations, respectively, whereas 59.4%, 17.6% and 48% of the variation in sediment load were explained by the combining effects of rainfall variability, changes of vegetation and runoff. This study provides a deep insight for understanding the effects of driving forces on sediment yield changes, and can be useful to regional soil conservation planning in the region.

J	Yu, SC; Wang, F; Qu, M; Yu, BH; Zhao, Z				Yu, Shichuan; Wang, Fei; Qu, Mei; Yu, Binhou; Zhao, Zhong			The Effect of Land Use/Cover Change on Soil Erosion Change by Spatial Regression in Changwu County on the Loess Plateau in China	FORESTS												Changwu County is a typical soil and water loss area on the Loess Plateau. Soil erosion is an important ecological process, and the impact of land use/cover change on soil erosion has received much attention. The present study used remote sensing images of the study area in 1987, 1997, 2007, and 2017 to analyze the land use/cover change (LULCC), and the RUSLE model was applied to estimate the soil erosion in different times. We exploited the Sankey diagram to visualize the spatiotemporal changes in land use/cover and soil erosion. We planned to obtain the most suitable model by comparing the application of different spatial regression models (Geographically weighted regression model, Spatial lag model, Spatial error model) and Ordinary least squares in LULCC and soil erosion changes. The results revealed that land use/cover has significantly changed in the last 30 years. From 1987 to 1997, cropland expansion came mainly from planted land and orchards, which transformed 68.99 km(2) and 64.93 km(2), respectively. In 1997-2007, the planted land increase was mainly through the conversion of cropland. In 2007-2017, the increase in orchard area came mainly from cropland. The forest land increase was mainly from the planted land. Soil erosion in Changwu County was dominated by slight erosion and light erosion, although the area of slight erosion and light erosion continued to decrease. The annual average soil erosion increased, which was estimated at 977.84 ton km(-2) year(-1), 1305.17 ton km(-2) year(-1), 1310.60 ton km(-2) year(-1), and 1891.46 ton km(-2) year(-1) in 1987, 1997, 2007, and 2017, respectively. These amounts of transformation mainly occurred when slight erosion was converted to light erosion, light erosion was converted to moderate erosion, and moderate erosion was converted to light and severe erosion. The Spatial lag model and Spatial error model have higher accuracy than the Geographically weighted regression model and Ordinary least squares when fitting the effect of LULCC and soil erosion change, where the accuracy exceeded 0.62 in different periods.																				1999-4907				SEP	2021	12	9							1209	10.3390/f12091209	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f12091209													WOS:000699750800001

M.; Dang, Zhiqiang; Zhao, Jingxue			Restoration approach for alpine extremely degraded landscapes: testing direct seeding and mulching with grass clippings	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Alpine meadows are key ecosystems that are facing increasing degradation due to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Despite tremendous efforts in ecological restoration and diverse communities rebuilding in alpine regions, restoration of extremely degraded alpine meadows (which have lost mattic epipedon) remains a major challenge for land managers. Here, we performed a field restoration experiment that combined seeding three grass species commonly (Elymus nutans, Poa annua, and Festuca sinensis) used in alpine meadow restoration with the application of grass clippings as mulch (bare land without mulching, 50% mulch cover, and 100% mulch cover) to ameliorate the soil surface conditions of degraded bare land. Soils covered with 50% and 100% mulching increased soil moisture, seedling density, plant cover, plant density, aboveground biomass, and belowground biomass, and reduced soil temperature during strong radiation days and insulated at night. In the three grass species seeding plots, mulching with grass clippings also improved seedling density, plant cover, plant density, and biomass. Moreover, 100% mulching had stronger restoration effect than 50% mulching. We further demonstrated that the improvement of surface microclimate in degraded alpine meadows by grass clipping mulching, that is, increasing soil moisture and regulating soil temperature, is an important reason for the success of grassland restoration. Mulching with grass clippings simulates the original mattic epipedon, improving the surface hydrothermal conditions and promoting ecological restoration facilitation. We encourage the application of locally available grass clippings after seeding as this can be an efficient, low-cost, and sustainable approach for restoring extremely degraded high-elevation alpine grassland ecosystems.

However, it remains unclear how thinning affects the key components of hydrological cycle of dense shrublands in the semiarid re-gions. Thus, the purpose of this study was to analyze and evaluate the effect of thinning on rainfall partitioning and interception simulations in dense shrublands. In a 5-year field experiment, we compared rainfall partitioning in two re-vegetated shrublands (Caragana korshinskii and Salix psammophila) in the Chinese Loess Plateau under two thinning intensities (moderate thinning [MT] and heavy thinning [HT] refer to the removal of 25% and 50% of the branches, respectively) or no thinning (NT) (control). We modeled canopy interception losses (I) in the two thinning treatments and control treatment using the revised Gash model. The results showed that under MT and HT, the throughfall (TF) rate increased by about 12% and 20%, respectively, compared to NT. The stemflow (SF) and observed I rates decreased by about 26% and 33%, respectively, under MT, and the corresponding values for HT were about 50% and 52%, respectively. The observed I rate decreased proportional to the percentage of biomass removed from the C. korshinskii and S. psammophila plots. The results also revealed a significant linear correlation between the plant area index (PAI) value and the canopy water balance of the two shrub plantations (R2 > 0.83, P < 0.05). The performance of the revised Gash model (i.e., relative error [RE] < 20%) was satis-factory according to the Nash -Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) coefficient (0.34-0.71). Based on the RE values, the performance of the revised Gash model was better when applied to the plots subjected to MT and HT (RE <= 3%) than NT (RE = 9.3%) for S. psammophila. Changes in the canopy storage capacity and canopy evaporation rate strongly affected changes in simulated interception loss. The model can facilitate water management in semiarid shrub plantations by accurately simulating the effect of thinning on interception loss.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				APR	2023	619								129299	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129299	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129299		FEB 2023											WOS:000947584800001

Plant and soil elemental C:N:P ratios are linked to soil microbial diversity during grassland restoration on the Loess Plateau, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Plant and soil elemental ratios of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) play a central role in shaping the composition and structure of microbial communities. However, the relationships between plant and soil elemental C:N:P ratios and microbial diversity are still poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the effects of C:N:P ratios in plant-soil systems on microbial diversity in a chronosequence of restored grasslands (1, 5,10,15, 25, and 30 years since restoration) on the Loess Plateau. We found that C and N concentrations, C:N and C:P ratios in leaf, root, soil and microbial biomass, bacterial and fungal diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) gradually increased with year since grassland restoration. Microbial C:N:P ratios ranged from 17.8:4.5:1 to 24.3:6.6:1, and C:P ratio increased from 17.8:1 at the 1-year site to 24.3:1 at the 30-year site, indicating the increasing P limitation for soil microorganisms during grassland development. Soil microbial diversity increased with root, soil, and microbial C and N concentrations, and decreased with P concentration (p < 0.05). Structural equation modeling indicated that soil and microbial C:N and N:P ratios had the greatest influences on soil bacterial and fungal diversity, and elemental C:N:P ratios had a greater effect on soil fungal than bacterial diversity. Our findings emphasize the importance of elemental C:N:P ratios on soil microbial diversity, which is critical for formulating policies for sustainable biodiversity conservation in terrestrial ecosystems.

Innovation Herein we developed new models for quantifying microbial metabolic limitations based on the stoichiometric and metabolic theories of ecology, using an extensive database (n = 2,667) that revealed relationships far from the widely recognized mean ratio of 1:1:1 for carbon : nitrogen : phosphorus (C : N : P) acquiring enzyme activities. We estimated the balance points of P and N acquisition (x(0), y(0)) in the absence of resource constraints to redefine the boundary between P versus N limitation. We then calculated two alternative boundary conditions defining P versus N limitation by scaling the classic threshold element ratio (TER), generating two new models (TEREEA and TERL). In addition, a new enzyme vector (V-T) model was devised by correcting traditional vector calculations based on observed enzyme activities against these balance points. Main conclusions These three new models more consistently predicted microbial metabolic limitations than the traditional TER and vector models. They also predicted that microbial metabolism in high-latitude grasslands and low-latitude forests were predominantly limited by soil N and P, respectively, and that increases in soil organic C with ecosystem development could intensify these limitations. In contrast, fertilizers alleviated these limitations in agricultural ecosystems, suggesting that widespread anthropogenic effects could potentially alter microbial resource limitations even in natural ecosystems. In addition, C limitation to microbial metabolism identified by the new V-T model showed a consistent negative correlation with microbial C use efficiency among ecosystems, confirming that resource constraints regulate microbial resource allocation. These new models provide more precise predictions of microbial metabolic limitations across a wide range of ecosystems and thus may be useful tools for the study of microbial macroecology.

(B. valdivianus). In southern Chile, B. valdivianus and Lolium perenne L. (L. perenne) coexist; however, the pasture defoliation criterion is based on the physiological growth and development of L. perenne. It is hypothesised that B. valdivianus needs a lower defoliation frequency than L. perenne to enhance its regrowth and energy reserves. Defoliation frequencies tested were based on B. valdivianus leaf stage 2 (LS-2), leaf stage 3 (LS-3), leaf stage 4 (LS-4) and leaf stage 5 (LS-5). The leaf stage development of Lolium perenne was monitored and contrasted with that of B. valdivianus. The study was conducted in a glasshouse and used a randomised complete block design. For Bromus valdivianus, the lamina length, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, tiller number per plant, leaf area, leaf weights, root growth rate, water-soluble carbohydrates (WSCs) and starch were evaluated. Bromus valdivianus maintained six live leaves with three leaves growing simultaneously. When an individual tiller started developing its seventh leaf, senescence began for the second leaf (the first relevant leaf for photosynthesis). Plant herbage mass, the root growth rate and tiller growth were maximised at LS-4 onwards. The highest leaf elongation rate, evaluated through the slope of the lamina elongation curve of a fully expanded leaf, was verified at LS-4. The water-soluble carbohydrates (WSCs) increased at LS-5; however, no statistical differences were found in LS-4. The LS-3 and LS-2 treatments showed a detrimental effect on WSCs and regrowth. The leaf photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance diminished while the leaf age increased. In conclusion, B. valdivianus is a 'six-leaf' species with leaf senescence beginning at LS-4.25. Defoliation at LS-4 and LS-5 was optimum for plant regrowth, maximising the aboveground plant parameters and total WSC accumulation. The LS-4 for B. valdivianus was equivalent to LS-3.5 for L. perenne. No differences related to tiller population in B. valdivianus were found in the different defoliation frequencies.

Suitable combinations of inoculant and fertilisation particularly phosphorus (P) play important roles in enhancing the effects of PGPB. The ecotoxic risks of antibiotics in agro-ecosystems are of great concern. A pot experiment was conducted to explore the effects of P fertilisation, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens inoculation, and oxytetracycline (OTC) on the bacterial community and the genes related to soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) conversion in the rhizosphere of alfalfa. Soil bacterial biodiversity including the number of species and richness was reduced by P fertilisation and OTC addition, enhanced by the inoculation of B. amyloliquefaciens without OTC addition. OTC increased the correlations among bacterial genera. The abun-dance of total 16S rRNA genes, N-and P-cycling functional genes was decreased by OTC in most cases, but increased at 0 mg P kg-1 and 160 mg OTC kg-1 (P-OTC+) when the soil was inoculated with B. amyloliquefaciens. The relative abundance of five bacterial genera, including Mesorhizobium and some uni-talicise uncultured genera, increased at P-OTC+ when inoculated with B. amyloliquefaciens. These genera might use the necromass of some microbes killed by OTC as a nutrient substrate for enhanced growth, thus enhancing the expression of N-and P-cycling functional genes. Overall, OTC altered the effects of P fertilisation and B. amyloliquefaciens inoculation on the bacterial community, N-and P-cycling functional genes in the rhizosphere of alfalfa.

Declining growth of R. pseudoacacia plantations has become a recently emerging challenge for revegetation and sustainable forest management in this region. In the suitable area of R. pseudoacacia, we selected four repre-sentative study sites along a precipitation gradient (aridity indexes of 1.3 at Fufeng, 1.5 at Changwu, 1.9 at Ansai, and 2.4 at Mizhi) and used an integrated Biome BioGeochemistry-plant hydraulic traits model (BBGC-SPERRY) to assess the climate change impacts on net primary productivity (NPP), maximum leaf area index (LAImax), actual evapotranspiration (AET), and annual average percentage loss of whole-plant hydraulic conductance (APLK) for R. pseudoacacia. We adopted climate scenario data derived from five downscaled Global Circulation Models under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and set baseline (1981-2020), near future (2021-2060, NFP) and far future (2061-2099, FFP) periods. Our projections show annual precipitation will significantly increase during the NFP and FFP at the Ansai and Mizhi sites and increase slightly at the Fufeng and Changwu sites during the FFP; annual maximum and minimum temperatures will increase under all RCPs. The mean NPP and LAImax of R. pseudoacacia will significantly decrease by 9.9% (RCP4.5) to 49.1% (RCP2.6) during the NFP and by 7.4% (RCP4.5) to 50.1% (RCP2.6) during the FFP at the Changwu, Ansai, and Mizhi sites; however, both measures will significantly increase during the NFP and FFP at the Fufeng site. The AET will significantly increase during the NFP and FFP at all sites. The maximum APLK will increase from south to north along the precipitation gradient, with values greater than 60% at the Changwu, Ansai, and Mizhi sites during the NFP and FFP. These results indicate the drought-induced mortality risk of R. pseudoacacia will increase under future climate change.						huang, ming bin/0000-0001-9792-3124													0168-1923	1873-2240				OCT 15	2022	325								109160	10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109160	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.109160		SEP 2022											WOS:000862505400001

The accurate quantification of SIF emitted by various scene components (tree crowns and background) may significantly improve the interpretation of top-of-canopy SIF (SIFtoc) measurements made over heterogeneous canopies. To do so, a three-dimensional (3-D) canopy SIF model (FluorFLiES) was introduced by coupling the excitation-fluorescence matrices (EF-matrices) with a 3-D Monte Carlo canopy radiative transfer model (Forest Light Environmental Simulator, FLiES). A tool was developed to construct forest canopy scene components from LiDAR data and enable their simulated contributions in structurally complex forest scenes. FluorFLiES is able to quantify SIF measurements with good accuracy at both half-hourly (R-2 = 0.72, RMSE = 0.26 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1)) and daily (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.19 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1)) scales. This study showed that non-photosynthetic elements in tree crowns, the fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and the background (including understory vegetation and soils) had a strong influence on SIFtoc intensity. Non-photosynthetic woody material suppressed the propagation of photons within crowns, thereby decreasing SIFtoc by around 10%. The canopy background made a significant contribution to SIFtoc in the NIR region by scattering downward SIF photons upward, and the background contribution increased rapidly with decreasing FVC: SIFtoc increased two-fold from 0.15 to 0.3 mW m(-2) sr(-1) nm(-1) when ground leaf area index increased from 0.5 to 1.5 m(2)/m(2). The results showed that the fluorescence escape ratio (f(esc)), a key variable relating observed SIFtoc to photosynthesis CO2 rate, contained a contribution from the background with a magnitude of 42%, even for relatively dense forest canopies. Assuming f(esc) simulated by the FluorFLiES model as a reference value, this study demonstrated that the current reflectance-based approach may cause large uncertainties (29%) when understory vegetation and/or FVC changes, largely due to neglecting the contribution of background elements. This study highlights the need to separate scene components and to consider multiple scattering within/among these components in interpreting the SIFtoc signal when working with heterogeneous ecosystems. The source code of FluorFLiES is available for further benchmarking.					li, bo/JJC-2664-2023; wang, wei/JBS-7400-2023; Cheng, Yuan/JKJ-0794-2023; Lu, Lu/JPE-5187-2023; Doody, Tanya/C-6890-2011; cheng, cheng/JBR-8359-2023; Wang, Siyi/JNT-2690-2023; Huete, Alfredo/C-1294-2008	Doody, Tanya/0000-0001-6359-5329; Gao, Sicong/0000-0001-6429-1917; Liu, Weiwei/0000-0001-9057-4857; Kobayashi, Hideki/0000-0001-9319-0621; Huete, Alfredo/0000-0003-2809-2376													0924-2716	1872-8235				SEP	2022	191						1	17		10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2022.07.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2022.07.004		JUL 2022											WOS:000829536800001

We employed a model system of rodents and their Mycoplasma pathogens, in which an extreme negative diversity-disease relationship was demonstrated, to test the assumptions underlying three mechanisms that may explain this field pattern. Through quantifying the long-term dynamics and effects of the pathogen in its three host species, we estimated the between-host differences in pathogen spreading and transmission potentials, and host recovery potential and vulnerability to infection. The results suggest that one of the hosts is a pathogen amplifier and the other two hosts function as diluters. Considering the similarity in infection success and intensity among hosts, and the failure to detect any pathogen-induced damage, we could not validate the assumption underlying the hypotheses that diluters reduce the overall transmission or increase the mortality of infected hosts in the system. Instead, the results demonstrate that diluters clear the infection faster than amplifiers, supporting the possibility that the addition of diluters to the community may reduce the overall number of infected hosts through this mechanism. This study highlights the contribution of experimental studies that simultaneously explore different aspects of host-pathogen interactions in multiple hosts, in diversity-disease research.

Herein, stability studies under concentrated sunlight are demonstrated as a powerful experimental methodology to investigate bias-dependent PSC degradation mechanisms. Stress testing of encapsulated PSCs' stability shows that light intensity is more significant than the illumination dose for PSC degradation under short-circuit (SC) conditions, whereas the dose is the determining factor under open-circuit (OC) stressing. This indicates that different degradation mechanisms are dominant under different bias conditions. It is postulated that degradation at SC biasing is dominated by ion migration, facilitated by photogenerated defects. Degradation at OC biasing can be explained by photogenerated radicals acting as nonradiative recombination centers (charge traps), which are created via reactions with accumulated charge carriers. Trap formation upon OC biasing is in accordance with degradation of photoluminescence and OC voltage (V-OC) observed under this stress. A combination of multiple mechanisms, all with reduced driving forces compared with OC /SC biasing, explains degradation at maximum power point biasing. Understanding the bias effect on PSC stability can elucidate the underlying degradation mechanisms and lead to routes to reduce them.

Changes in rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community composition with vegetation restoration in planted forests	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Soil microbial communities affect nutrient cycling and ecosystem functioning. However, the variations in microbial diversity and community composition within degraded landscapes remain unclear. Using high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes and internal transcribed spacer fungal sequences, we investigated the rhizosphere microbial diversity and community of coniferous Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. forests in degraded lands across a chronosequence that spanned over 60 years (10, 25, 40, and 60 years since restoration, four forest stands). We found significant differences in soil bacterial and fungal communities among stand ages. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria dominated the rhizosphere, whereas Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Zygomycota prevailed as fungal components. With stand development, bacterial diversity decreased, but fungal diversity increased. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis separated bacterial community clusters well by stands. Fungal community clusters of 25- and 60-year-old stands overlapped. The dominant bacteria Acidobacteria showed the highest relative abundance at the 40-year-old stands. Soil microbial communities correlated significantly with the macro-nutrients (soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorous). Additionally, the relative abundance of Acidobacteria at the phylum level correlated positively with soil total phosphorous; Deltaproteobacteria at the class level correlated positively with soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. Thus, restoring vegetation in degraded temperate forests enhanced some macronutrients and influenced microbial communities. Our results revealed that restoring vegetation in degraded lands decreased the diversity of bacterial communities over time. In contrast, the soil fungal diversity increased after restoration, and fungal communities in the 25- and 60-year-old forest stands overlapped on degraded soils.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the new soil conditioner DewEco (fermented organic material consisted mainly of salt of L-lysine and citric acid) on sandy soil quality and plant growth. Serial dosages of DewEco and nitrogen (N) fertilizer were mixed into sandy soils and planted maize in a greenhouse. DewEco application increased large soil particle composition and decreased small soil particle composition. Soil porosity and the liquid phase increased as the DewEco dosage increased. DewEco also decreased soil pH and increased soil electrical conductivity, soil organic matter content, total nitrogen and available potassium. DewEco significantly enhanced the soil water-holding capacity and soil effective water content although it also increased the wilting coefficient. Finally, DewEco markedly promoted maize growth while improving water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). In addition, there was an interaction effect between DewEco and nitrogen fertilizer, such that the combined effects of DewEco and N exceeded the sum of their respective effects promoting plant growth. Thus, DewEco application can significantly enhance soil water content and nutrient levels by alleviating sandy soil's physical and chemical properties, thereby promoting plant growth, WUE and NUE. This study indicates that DewEco is a useful eco-friendly sandy soil conditioner for arid and semi-arid regions.

Subsequently, the structural transformations of lignin samples and the reaction mechanism were investigated in detail. The soil column leaching experiment was also performed to research the nitrogen release behavior of aminated lignin in soil. The results indicated that the amounts of active sites in lignin were significantly increased to 8.26 mmol/g from the original 2.91 mmol/g by phenolation. In addition, the Mannich reaction was highly selective for occurring at ortho- and para-positions of phenolic hydroxyl groups in the phenolated lignin, in which the latter was favored. Moreover, the nitrogen content in the aminated lignin was highly depended on the types of amination reagent instead of the proportion of reactants in this study. Under an optimal condition, aminated lignin with a high nitrogen content (10.13%) and low C/N ratio (6.08) could be obtained. Besides, it was especially noteworthy that the prepared APL in this study has a favorable nitrogen release behavior in soil. Thus, it is believed that these aminated lignin derivatives could be used for the preparation of various lignin-based highly efficient nitrogen fertilizer. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the impact of soil water and integrated fertilization after eight years on prokaryotic microbial communities in different compartments of root zone and their association with wheat nitrogen (N) absorption and yield were investigated. The results showed that compared with fertilization treatments (F), water regimes (W) more drastically modulated the prokaryotic microbial community structure and diversity in bulk soil, rhizosphere and endosphere. The increase of irrigation improved the prokaryotic diversity in the rhizosphere and endosphere while decreased the diversity in the bulk soil. Application of organic fertilizers significantly improved soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrient contents, increased rhizosphere and endophytic prokaryotic microbial diversity, and elevated the relative abundance of aerobic ammonia oxidation and nitrification-related functional microorganisms in rhizosphere and endosphere. Increasing irrigation elevated the relative abundance of functional microorganisms related to aerobic ammonia oxidation and nitrification in the rhizosphere and endosphere. Soil water content (SWC) and NH4+-N as well as NO3--N were key predictors of prokaryotic microbial community composition under W and F treatments, respectively. Appropriate application of irrigation and organic fertilizers increased the relative abundance of some beneficial bacteria such as Flavobacterium. Water and fertilization treatments regulated the prokaryotic microbial communities of bulk soil, rhizosphere and endosphere by altering SWC and SOM, and provided evidence for the modulation of prokaryotic microorganisms to promote nitrogen uptake and wheat yield under long-term irrigation and fertilization. Conclusively, the addition of organic manure (50 %) with inorganic fertilizers (50 %) and reduced amount of irrigation (pre-sowing and jointing-period irrigation) decreased the application amount of chemical fertilizers and water, while increased SOM and nutrient content, improved prokaryotic diversity, and changed prokaryotic microbial community structure in the wheat root zone, resulting in enhanced nutrient uptake and wheat yield.

J	Huang, Z; Liu, Y; Tian, FP; Wu, GL				Huang, Ze; Liu, Yu; Tian, Fu-Ping; Wu, Gao-Lin			Soil water availability threshold indicator was determined by using plant physiological responses under drought conditions	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Soil water shortage is a critical limiting factor that threaten the growth of vegetation and their sustainability in semi-arid areas. Grasses directly respond to the soil water availability (SWA), and the soil water shortage degree can be studied through plant physiological response thresholds under soil drought stress. In this study, the lower-and-optimal limitation of SWA was evaluated with pots along the soil water gradient by quantifying plant gas exchange parameters. These parameters showed a strong cubic relationship with the relative soil water content (RWC) in four forage species. The lower limitation of RWC was obtained for Onobrychis viciifolia (4.0%-20.2%), followed by Astragalus adsurgens (15.5%-25.5%), Elymus nutans (16.1%-27.2%), and Lolium multiflorum (24.6%-35.8%). The average RWC was of 74.83%, and the water saturation point of water use efficiency (WSPWUE) showed a similar critical scope in the four species: Onobrychis viciifolia (71.2%-82.8%), Astragalus adsurgens (72.1%-84.2%), Elymus nutans (79.3%-85.1%), and Lolium multiflorum (76.7%-85.6%). The highest productivity with the highest availability of water (HPHAW) for Onobrychis viciifolia, Astragalus adsurgens, Elymus nutans and Lolium multiflorum was of 71.2%-82.8%, 72.1%-84.2%, 79.3%-85.1% and 76.7%-85.6%, respectively. The lower limitation of RWC, the maximum water use efficiency (WUEmax) and HPHAW in legumes were lower than those values obtained in gramineae, suggesting that legumes were more susceptible to soil drought stress. We concluded that plant gas exchange parameters acted as indicators for SWA under drought conditions, and represented a valuable tool for identifying SWA threshold response in environmental changes.

In this study, we conducted a laboratory microcosm experiment to determine the various burrowing activities of Eisenia fetida and their impact on the soil hydraulic properties in response to different levels of soil moisture (50%, 70%, 90% of field capacity) in two common soil types (loessial and Lou soil) obtained from the Loess Plateau. Burrowing activity of E. fetida increased with higher soil moisture and was greater in loessial than in Lou soil. Most burrowing activities occurred within the top 5 cm and decreased with increasing soil depth. Macropores and burrow branching, which are highly related to the earthworm burrowing, were more prevalent in wetter soil. Earthworms significantly altered the formation of large soil aggregates (AG(L), diameter >2 mm) under different soil moistures and depths. Distinct earthworm burrowing activities, controlled by soil moisture, altered soil hydraulic properties. However, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) showed little differences between different treatments due to the horizontal and high-branched burrows of E. fetida, although higher burrowing activities were found in wetter soil. Soil field capacity was highest in drier soil due to the less macropores and burrowing activities.																				2071-1050				NOV	2020	12	21							9303	10.3390/su12219303	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12219303													WOS:000589327100001

Weighing these animals is extremely difficult because of the general wild nature of yaks and the lack of proper weighing equipment on the plateau. The aim of this study was to determine whether body measurements of yaks could be used to estimate their live body weight (LBW). Photographs were taken of 39, 52 and 55 yaks, aged 1 to 8 years, in summer (July), winter (November) and spring (April), respectively. Each yak was weighed and, from its photograph, withers height (WH), body diagonal length (BDL) and body side area (BSA) were calculated. Simple regression analyses between LBW and each of the linear measurements within each season were all highly significant and explained 78.3% to 94.6% of the variance in LBW. Multiple linear regressions between LBW and body measurements improved the predictive power within each season and explained 86.3% to 97.2% of the variance in LBW. We concluded that body measurements could be used to estimate LBW of yaks; to improve the estimate, calibrations of LBW on linear measurements should be done in each season. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about how the loss of mattic epipedon (the characteristic topsoil of alpine meadows) alters the water conservation capacity of the region. Here we examined the effects of different mattic epipedon coverages on surface runoff, evapotranspiration, and soil water storage under different rainfall conditions. Our results showed that the surface runoff was significantly higher under moderate rain conditions (P > 10 mm day(-1)) than under light rain conditions (P < 10 mm day(-1)), and that declining coverage significantly increased surface runoff, especially under moderate rain conditions. The average evapotranspiration at 90 %, 60 %, and 30 % mattic epipedon coverages were 5.38 mm, 5.88 mm, and 6.38 mm under non-rainfall conditions, and 0.97 mm, 1.60 mm, and 2.24 mm under moderate rain conditions. Meanwhile, mattic epipedon coverage had a positive effect on the supplementation of soil water under moderate rainfall and on the conservation of soil water under non-rainfall conditions. Overall, alpine meadows with higher mattic epipedon coverage were more effective at maintaining surface runoff and improving soil water conservation. These findings highlight the importance of conserving and restoring alpine meadows to improve the water security in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and other downstream regions.

A meta-analysis was carried out to evaluate the effect of cover crop on precipitation storage efficiency (PSE, the percent of precipitation that is stored in the soil during the fallow period), soil water storage at succeeding crop planting (SWSP), succeeding crop yield, and WUE from data collected from 117 studies across the world. Cover crop decreased PSE by 33.4% and soil water storage for the whole profile (SWSPT) at soil depth by 13.2%, but increased water storage to a depth of 30 cm (SWSP30) by 6.0% (P < 0.05) compared to no cover crop. Cover crop did not affect succeeding crop yield, but decreased evapotranspiration (ET) by 6.2% and increased WUE by 5.0% (P < 0.05) compared to no cover crop. The effect of cover crop on these parameters varied by soil and climatic conditions of various regions. Leaving cover crop residue at the soil surface or incorporating into the soil reduced PSE, SWSPT, and ET, but increased SWSP30 and WUE compared to residue removal. Maintaining cover crop biomass at 5 Mg ha(-1) and leaving a 20-d interval between cover crop termination and succeeding crop planting, also enhanced PSE and SWSP30. Although cover crop had minimal impact on succeeding crop yield, WUE of succeeding crops can be increased with cover cropping by decreasing evapotranspiration.

The agricultural drainage water is an important water resource which can be reused for agriculture. Thus, the current study aims to assess the quality of drainage water for irrigation purpose through monitoring and predicting its suitability for irrigation. The chemical composition of Bahr El-Baqr water drain, especially salinity, as well as ions are mainly involved in calculating indicators of water suitability for irrigation, i.e., Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO-3, Cl-, and SO42-. Further analysis was carried out to evaluate the irrigation water quality index (IWQI) through integrated approaches and artificial neural network (ANN) model. Further, ARIMA models were developed to forecast IWQI of Bahr El-Baqr drain in Egypt. The results indicated that the computed IWQI values ranged between 46 and 81. Around 11% of the samples were classified as excellent water, while 89% of the samples were categorized as good water. The results of IWQI showed a standard deviation of 8.59 with a mean of 62.25, indicating that IWQI varied by 13.79% from the average. ANN model showed much higher prediction accuracy in IWQI modeling withR(2)value greater than 0.98 during training, testing and validation. A relatively good correlation was obtained, between the actual and forecasted IWQI based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC); the best fit models were ARIMA (1,0) (0,0) without seasonality. The determination coefficient (R-2) of ARIMA models was 0.23. Accordingly, 23% of IWQI variability could be explained by different model parameters. These findings will support the water resources managers and decision-makers to manage the irrigation water resources that can be implemented in the future.					abdo, ahmed/GLT-8721-2022; Abdel-Fattah, Mohamed/AAF-2881-2021	abdo, ahmed/0000-0003-2637-8573; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2021	28	1					898	914		10.1007/s11356-020-10543-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10543-3		AUG 2020						32822008					WOS:000561514500003

Seasonal and spatial variability in total and active bacterial communities from desert soil	PEDOBIOLOGIA												Studies describing the diversity of microorganisms in drylands are based mainly on the total (DNA), and seldom on the metabolically active (RNA) portion of the bacterial communities. We predicted that in desert environments, the majority of bacteria would display low activity during the hot and dry season, resulting in comparable diversity of the total and active communities. But during the wet periods, when rain activates certain bacterial groups, the total and active communities would differ. To test our predictions, the rDNA and rRNA extracted from desert soil, were analysed in samples collected during the dry and wet seasons from three patches: under the canopy of the dominant shrub, near ant nests and in open patches. The results disproved our predictions because the RNA- and DNA-based communities significantly differed in the dry season but matched very well in the wet season samples. Further comparative analysis of the rRNA/rDNA ratio revealed the composition and structure of metabolically active members within the patches' communities. Our results suggest that in desert environments, the activity of soil bacterial communities is not restricted by water availability or patch types and could be fully described only, by concomitant analysis of the total and active members.

The field experiment was conducted to study the effect of four ridge width on growth and water use efficiency (WUE) of maize (Xianyu 335) with same furrow spacing and basin planting with same spacing as conventional planting (CP). Compared with the CP, ridge-furrow (RF) increased plant height but reduced stem diameter and dry matter weight. The wide ridge under RF was beneficial to the high leaf area and dry matter accumulation. However, the least plant spacing generated stress on stem growth with a wider ridge (RF180). The maximum grain yield (6573 kg ha(-1)) and WUE (23.0 kg mm(-1) ha(-1)) were obtained under RF120, which were increased by 15.9% and 33.9% compared with CP. Irrigation efficiency and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) under RF system was improved 1.20-1.43 times and 1.89-2.45 times compared with CP, which was mainly due to the lower volume of irrigation water (decreased by 34.5-42.9%) under the RF system. Our results highlight that the RF method can be used as a water-saving method with ridge width up to 120 cm that lead to high yields of maize.

Efficient irrigation and water use are essential for the sustainable development and management of water resources in the area. This research applied DSSAT-maize in the Loess Plateau (Fenhe basin) to determine the suitable irrigation management and optimum sowing dates to ensure the stability of spring maize production. The model was calibrated using the full irrigation treatment of 2017-2019 growing seasons. Crop data, such as plant phenological phases, aboveground biomass, crop yield, and leaf area index, were used for model calibration. The calibration showed great consistency between the measured and simulated data, with nRMSE (normalized root mean square error) ranging from 0.77% to 21.6%. The field values of crop yield, aboveground biomass, LAI, soil water content, and water use efficiency were used to evaluate the calibrated model's performance, the model evaluation was found to be satisfactory with acceptable nRMSE ranging from 1.9% to 25.3%. Optimum simulated sowing dates for increased productivity and water efficiency were between 15 and 25 May. The optimum irrigation timing and volume of irrigation water application were 85 mm at the tasseling phase and 85 mm at the grouting phase respectively. Therefore, the yield of maize can be increased by applying irrigation and altering the sowing date in case rainfall is insufficient to satisfy the water demand of the crops in the Fenhe basin.					郑, 利剑/ABH-3048-2021	RUGIRA, Patrick/0000-0001-6187-990X														2073-4395				APR	2021	11	4							674	10.3390/agronomy11040674	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11040674													WOS:000642665100001

The objective of this study is to further assess soil resistance-enlarging potential of this twofold effect of roots, especially for different textured soils. Two textured soils (silt loam and silt clay) and four kinds of soil samples (1. bared parent soils, representing samples with no root effect, 2. bared tillage soils, representing samples with biochemical effect alone, 3. root-texture cotton thread-permeated soils, representing samples with root net-link effect alone and 4. Purple alfalfa root-permeated soils, representing samples with root total effect.) were prepared and tested in flume experiments. The results showed that soil resistance to concentrated flow increased and sediment yields decreased in different degrees due to different root effects. Root physical effect increased soil resistance to a larger extent compared with root biochemical effect (the relative contribution values of root physical effect were 85% and 89% in silt loam and silt clay soil, respectively). In root physical effect, root soil bonding appeared to act as the main form, particularly in silt clay.																			1064-2293	1556-195X				OCT	2022	55	10					1490	1497		10.1134/S1064229322100179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1064229322100179		AUG 2022											WOS:000843439900003

Physio-morphological and mechanical properties of chillies for mechanical harvesting	JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCES												The plants and its produce characteristics are the basis to design a crop specific harvester. The objective of this study was to determine the physical, morphological and mechanical properties of chilli plant and fruits, that can be used in the design of harvester machine. The observations and data were collected by taking measurements at harvesting stage of three chilli cultivars. The fruit bearing behavior of plants was solitary with fruit position erect in Demon F-1 and pendent in Arka Meghana and Mahyco Tejaswini. The plant height ranged between 81.76 to 84.87 cm depending on cultivars number of fruits per plant were 170.25, 158.96 and 156.15 in Tehaswini, Arka Meghana and Menon respectively. It was observed that the length and diameter at shoulder of fruits was in the range of 4.97 to 10.44 cm and 0.8 to 1.25 cm, respectively. The moisture content reduced in leaves, stems and fruits as the maturation changed from matured green fruits bearing of plants to semi dry condition. The detachment force of fruits from plants increased as the fruits colour changed from matured green to fully ripened red and there after decreased.																			0973-354X	2582-4899				DEC	2021	16	2					271	279																WOS:000893655500016

However, the knowledge regarding the distribution of persistent free radicals (PFRs) and redox capacity in different molecular weight fractions (MWF) of humic add (HA) and their impact on the transformation of iron oxide minerals remains unknown. In this study, we separated bulk HA into various MWF using dialysis methods and systematically investigated their PFRs properties, redox capacity, and the impact in reducing goethite. The results showed that the PFRs in the low MWF ( <3500, <7000, and <14,000 Da) can be assigned to oxygen-centered organic radicals while those in the bulk and high MWF (14000-retentate) were assigned to carbon-centered organic radicals. The PFRs concentrations of low MWF were 0.20-0.45 x 10(16) spins/g, far less than those of bulk HA (3.04 x 10(16) spins/g) and 14000-retentate (1.30 x 10(16) spins/g). The total concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by PFRs in HA fractions ranged from 8.04 x 10(16) (in 14000-retentate) to 32.35 x 10(16) spins/g (in bulk HA). Compared with the low MWF, the 14000-retentate fractions had the higher reducing capacity, which was positively related to the content of PFRs and phenolic hydroxyl in HA. The results obtained provide valuable insight into the geochemistry processes of Fe-containing minerals during their interaction with HA in the natural environment. Overall, the results obtained provide valuable insight into the geochemical behaviors of HA-associated PFRs under natural conditions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Dai, SB; Ma, YL; Zhang, KD				Dai, Shubing; Ma, Yulei; Zhang, Kuandi			Land Degradation Caused by Construction Activity: Investigation, Cause and Control Measures	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												The rapid expansion of construction land has been a common phenomenon worldwide, which resulted in the loss of high-quality arable land and severe land degradation. Here, a statistical analysis, together with a field investigation, was carried out in China to address the challenges. This study has gathered data on the reduction of land amount and quality caused by construction activities and has collected the relevant policies to control land deterioration caused by those activities. The increasing amount of farmland and open space are occupied by construction use. The annual growth of construction land from 2001 to 2017 was 43.64 x 10(4) hm(2), with an annual average of about 38 x 10(4) hm(2) of cultivated land being converted to construction land in China. Construction activities usually cause a deterioration of the physico-chemical properties in and around construction site soils. The organic matter of post-construction soil was lower than the pre-construction by 257.4 similar to 879.8%. A lack of strong economic incentives for developers, limited effectiveness of measures to control land degradation, and weak requirements and enforcement of relevant laws and regulations allow land degradation from construction activities to remain at a significant level. For more efficiency and success, the study proposes effective measures to control the hazards that occur so widely in China.

Methods and findings 42 data sets including PRJNA380841 and PRJNA369686 were used to construct the co-expression network through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A total of 1,896,897,901 (284.30 Gb) clean reads and 35,021 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from 42 samples. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that photosynthesis, DNA replication, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and cell cycle were significantly influenced by drought stress. Furthermore, the DEGs with similar expression patterns, detected by K-means clustering, were grouped into 29 clusters. Genes involved in the modules, such as dark turquoise, yellow, and brown, were found to be appreciably linked with drought resistance. Twelve central, greatly correlated genes in stage-specific modules were subsequently confirmed and validated at the transcription levels, includingTraesCS7D01G417600.1 (PP2C),TraesCS5B01G565300.1 (ERF),TraesCS4A01G068200.1 (HSP),TraesCS2D01G033200.1 (HSP90),TraesCS6B01G425300.1 (RBD),TraesCS7A01G499200.1 (P450),TraesCS4A01G118400.1 (MYB),TraesCS2B01G415500.1 (STK),TraesCS1A01G129300.1 (MYB),TraesCS2D01G326900.1 (ALDH),TraesCS3D01G227400.1 (WRKY), andTraesCS3B01G144800.1 (GT). Conclusions Analyzing the response of wheat to drought stress during different growth stages, we have detected three modules and 12 hub genes that are associated with drought resistance mechanisms, and five of those genes are newly identified for drought resistance. The references provided by these modules will promote the understanding of the drought-resistance mechanism. In addition, the candidate genes can be used as a basis of transgenic or molecular marker-assisted selection for improving the drought resistance and increasing the yields of wheat.					z, y/HPC-0477-2023; Zhang, Y J/HLG-1022-2023; zhang, ying/HJB-1230-2022; Sun, Lijing/G-1258-2011														1932-6203					AUG 31	2020	15	8							e0236186	10.1371/journal.pone.0236186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236186								32866164					WOS:000567946300031

However, few studies have explored relatively active populations that are continuously active throughout the year. This study aimed to determine the relationship between frequency of going out and MCI among non-homebound older adults who participated in group activities to prevent frailty. Methods This prospective cohort study used frequency of going out as the exposure and MCI as the outcome. The Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale and questionnaires about daily life were completed by 153 community-dwelling older adults aged >= 65 years participating in frailty prevention groups in a rural town. The baseline survey was conducted from December 2017 to March 2018 and analysed cross-sectionally. Follow-up surveys were conducted at 1- and 2-years and analysed longitudinally. Results Univariate and binomial logistic regression analyses at baseline showed no association between MCI and frequency of going out in older adults with physical limitations. However, there was a significant association in older adults without physical limitations. A binomial logistic regression analysis of the frequency of going out at baseline and cognitive function at the 2-year follow-up showed no association between MCI and frequency of going out in older adults with physical limitations, but there was a significant association in those without physical limitations. Conclusion Our results suggest that frequency of going out may not be a useful indicator of MCI in older adults with physical limitations, although low frequency of going out may be an indicator of MCI in older adults without physical limitations.

The effect of variability of physical properties of the deep vadose zone on nitrate transport has been scarcely explored. Recently, deep nitrate storage profiles were determined in the vadose zone of the Loess Plateau of China. Using these observations along with measured soil properties, this study investigates the effect of loess vertical heterogeneity on water movement and nitrate transport through the deep vadose zone. Models of different complexity were established and calibrated. First, a simple piston flow and nitrate mass balance approach was calibrated to the observed nitrate storage. The results indicate that the total nitrate storage is estimated well, while the estimation of the distribution of nitrate is relatively poor. Subsequently, Richards' equation and the Advection-Dispersion equation were evaluated. Three different conceptualizations of the numerical models were calibrated against deep vadose zone nitrate and water content observations: (1) one-layer model assuming homogenous loess vadose zone; (2) a model that considers a hydraulic conductivity (Ks) decay function and (3) a model where the Miller-Miller scaling factors are prescribed to account for changes of the hydraulic functions with depth. Accounting for the vertical Ks decay in the numerical models improved water flow performances. The study reveals the adequacy of implementing water flow and nitrate transport numerical models together with a simple representation of the vertical loess variability, for simulating nitrate migration in loess deep vadose zone environments.

REMOTE SENSING												The timely and accurate estimation of grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) is important. Machine learning (ML) has been widely used in the past few decades to deal with complex relationships. In this study, based on an 11-year period (2005-2015) of AGB data (1620 valid AGB measurements) on the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR), combined with remote sensing data, weather data, terrain data, and soil data, we compared the predictive performance of a linear statistical method, machine learning (ML) methods, and evaluated their temporal and spatial scalability. The results show that machine learning can predict grassland biomass well, and the existence of an independent validation set can help us better understand the prediction performance of the model. Our findings show the following: (1) The random forest (RF) based on variables obtained through stepwise regression analysis (SRA) was the best model (R-vad(2) = 0.60, RMSEvad = 1245.85 kg DW (dry matter weight)/ha, AIC = 5583.51, and BIC = 5631.10). It also had the best predictive capability of years with unknown areas (R-indep(2) = 0.50, RMSEindep = 1332.59 kg DW/ha). (2) Variable screening improved the accuracy of all of the models. (3) All models' predictive accuracy varied between 0.45 and 0.60, and the RMSE values were lower than 1457.26 kg DW/ha, indicating that the results were reliably accurate.					liu, chenli/ABD-2538-2020	liu, chenli/0000-0001-6389-8792; Chai, Ning/0000-0003-2870-1653; Hou, Mengjing/0000-0001-8588-8026; Zhang, Feng/0000-0001-5893-0604														2072-4292				AUG	2022	14	16							3843	10.3390/rs14163843	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14163843													WOS:000846604500001

The action planning of grasping and picking is key to improving the operational efficiency of picking robots. In this study, first, from the perspective of grip stability, the grasping positions of a three-finger end-effector were planned in two cases to determine an optimal three-finger grip posture: one that is parallel to the apple stem-calyx axis and the other being centripetal to the apple equatorial plane. Second, based on the gripping posture parallel to the apple stem-calyx axis, four picking patterns were designed: vertical pull, horizontal pull, vertical rotation, and rotation-horizontal pull. With the horizontal displacement, vertical displacement, and rotation angle as the main factors influencing the picking process, it was found through ABAQUS simulation software and the response surface analysis method that the rotation-horizontal pull pattern with the combination of horizontal displacement and rotation angle yields the minimum separation force for apple piking. With the three-fingered hand in the optimal grasping posture parallel to the stem-calyx, the four picking patterns were tested on a dedicated apple picking experimental device equipped with a grip force acquisition sensor, and the test results showed that the average three-finger grip force required for rotary tug-pull picking was the lowest (10.33 N). The proposed rotation-horizontal pull pattern with the three-finger grip posture was proven to be the best pattern for apple picking. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for further research on apple picking robots.																			0168-1699	1872-7107				SEP	2021	188								106353	10.1016/j.compag.2021.106353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.106353		JUL 2021											WOS:000685647900002

The districts were purposively selected based on potential and accessibility and then stratified into lowland, midland, and highland. In total, 135 beekeepers, of which 126 were males and 9 were females, were interviewed using a pretested semistructured questionnaire. The result revealed that beekeeping is actively practiced by the community regardless of age and sex. Three beekeeping production systems, that is, traditional, transitional, and movable frame hive, have been identified, accounting for 80%, 4%, and 16%, respectively. More than 80% of total bee colonies are managed being placed in the backyard. Besides, the study indicated that about 79% of the beekeepers keep bees primarily for income generation and home consumption. According to this study, the average bee colony holding size is 5.13 per a beekeeper. Also, this study identified that the swarm catching method is the major source of bee colony accounting for more than 45% to start beekeeping and 76% to increase existing colony number. Bee colony decline, absconding and swarming, honeybee pests and predators, and lack of training and extension were identified as major beekeeping challenges in the study areas. This study identified the beekeeping production system, opportunities, and challenges of the study areas and has significantly contributed to our knowledge and identified lack of extension and training as intervention areas. Therefore, practical beekeeping training and extension should get primary emphasis to combat the existing challenges.

A field study was conducted during May and June 2017 to investigate the impacts of magnitude and patterns of hyporheic exchange on the sediment macroinvertebrate community in the Weihe River basin. The results demonstrate that upwelling flows cause resuspension of riverbed sediment, increasing the proportion of swimmer groups (such as Baetidae) in the macroinvertebrate community. However, large resuspension of river bed sediment results in a reduced abundance of macroinvertebrates. By controlling the transport processes of dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nutrients, temperature, and different patterns of hyporheic exchange strongly influence the structure of macroinvertebrate communities. Downwelling is more likely to produce rich invertebrate communities than upwelling. The magnitude for the hyporheic flux of 150-200 mm/d was optimal for the macroinvertebrate community in the Weihe River Basin. Above or below this rate results in a decline in community abundance and diversity. We suggest that research is conducted to better understand the effects of hyporheic exchange across bedforms on macroinvertebrate communities. The study supports any activities to preserve the ecological functions and health of rivers dominated by fine-grained sediments.

J	Liang, Y; Jiao, JY; Dang, WQ; Cao, W				Liang, Yue; Jiao, Juying; Dang, Weiqin; Cao, Wei			The Thresholds of Sediment-Generating Rainfall from Hillslope to Watershed Scales in the Loess Plateau, China	WATER												Obtaining practical thresholds for erosive rainfall plays a crucial role in calculating rainfall erosivity and predicting water erosion. Nevertheless, the study of thresholds on subwatershed and watershed scales remains scarce. Given this, we presented the critical rainfall that generated the outflows of subwatersheds and watersheds as the threshold of sediment-generating rainfall. On the basis of the observation of twelve nested topographical units at the Peijiamaogou watershed in the Loess Plateau of China, we fitted regression relationships between rainfall indexes (rainfall amount, maximum 30-min intensity, maximum 60-min intensity, rainfall amount multiply maximum 30-min intensity, and rainfall amount multiply maximum 60-min intensity) and the proportion of cumulative sediment yield to the total sediment yield. We determined the thresholds of sediment-generating rainfall and explored the variabilities of thresholds across different spatial scales. Moreover, the covering area proportion (CAP) with rainfall indexes higher than the thresholds was also employed as thresholds at the subwatershed and watershed scales. The thresholds of CAP for P and I-30 were 50.5% and 47.6% at the subwatershed scale, while 31.0% and 30.3% at the watershed scale. The thresholds of P and I-30 at the subwatershed scale were higher than those of hillslope scale, while the threshold of I-30 at the watershed scale was smaller compared to the other scales. In general, I-30 was viewed as the best threshold among single rainfall indexes across different spatial scales, while P was not recommended as a practical threshold. This study can improve the prediction accuracy of water erosion across different spatial scales and develop the spatial scale effect of sediment yield in the loess hilly areas.																				2073-4441				NOV	2019	11	11							2392	10.3390/w11112392	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11112392													WOS:000502264500194

Species associations and trait dissimilarity in communities of ectoparasitic arthropods harboured by small mammals at three hierarchical scales	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY												1. This study tested the relationships between the probability of pairwise species co-occurrence and pairwise dissimilarity in their traits in infracommunities (across assemblages harboured by conspecific individual hosts within a locality), component communities (across assemblages harboured by host species within a locality), and compound communities (across assemblages in different localities) of fleas and gamasid mites parasitic on small mammals in Western Siberia. 2. A significant, albeit weak, tendency was found for flea communities harboured by conspecific host individuals, host species, and host communities to be composed of similar species. No relationship between the probability of co-occurrence and trait dissimilarity was detected for mite communities at any hierarchical scale. 3. For fleas, this study explained the link between positive co-occurrence and trait dissimilarity by a process resembling environmental filtering realised mainly via host traits for infracommunities and component communities and via off-host environment for compound communities, thus suggesting that the identical shape of the relationships between co-occurrence and trait dissimilarity at different scales was driven by different mechanisms. 4. The explanation of the lack of this relationship in mites included: (i) the paucity of the subset of mite traits used in this study and its potential inadequacy for the question at hand; and (ii) possible masking of the effect induced by one trait on co-occurrence owing to the lack of this effect induced by another trait(s). 5. Caution is recommended regarding the compilation of a dataset involving multiple traits, its analysis, and the interpretation of the results.

Enhancing the electronic properties of VLS-grown silicon nanowires by surface charge transfer	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												The need to develop new energy storage technology has led to deeper investigation into materials science to produce highly efficient batteries, primarily the lithium ion battery. The importance of electrodes in such devices has led to the reemergence of silicon nanowires (Si NWs) at the forefront of materials study-in this context, as an energy storage material (as electrodes). Redox potential and work function play the most important roles in charge transfer, the battery charging/discharging process. Thus, the NWs' interfacial properties become important in achieving higher stability and efficiency. In this work, a deep study was conducted using equilibrium perturbation to change the surface electronic properties of Si NWs, which can be integrated into various technologies, while simultaneously achieving an interesting interface that is chemically passive and cheap to produce. By using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope, a Kelvin probe, and contact angle measurement, combined with theoretical analysis, a full picture is achieved regarding the Si NWs' interface, paving the way for this new technique to develop unique interfaces and to achieve a higher energy capacity and a longer lifetime.

However, the fine-scale (around a single plant) spatial distribution of SOC and its liable organic carbon (LOC) fractions after afforestation in semiarid deserts are poorly understood. Pinus sylvestris and Salix psammophila afforested on shifting sandy land (S-land) were selected to quantify fine-scale (at 20, 80, 150 and 240 cm away from the trees) spatial distribution of SOC and its LOC fractions in the southeast edge of Mu Us Desert, China. The results showed that the afforested S. psammophila and P. sylvestris significantly increased SOC, total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and readily oxidized organic carbon (ROOC). At 20 cm distance, SOC storage of P. sylvestris was 27.21% higher than S. psammophila in 0-100 cm soil layers, and SOC storage of S. psammophila at 80 and 150 cm distances was 5.50% and 5.66% higher than P. sylvestris, respectively. Compared with S-land, SOC storage under S. psammophila and P. sylvestris significantly increased by 94.90%, 39.50%, 27.10% and 18.50% at 20, 80, 150 and 240 cm distance, respectively. ROOC accounted for 14.09% and 18.93% of SOC under S. psammophila and P. sylvestris, respectively. Our results suggest that afforestation can promote SOC accumulation at different distances from the plants, and that P. sylvestris allocates more organic matter to the closer soil compared with S. psammophila (<80 cm from the tree).

We analyzed the responses of growth parameters of winter wheat in field experiments in the main grain-producing area of China to different types and amounts of activated irrigation water and their influence on WUE. The wheat absorbed about 12.2% more activated water than pure groundwater. Aboveground biomass was about 8.0% higher with activated water than pure groundwater. The yield components performed best with an irrigation amount of 120 mm, with grain yield 28.3 and 3.2% higher than for amounts of 60 and 180 mm, respectively. Grain yield at 120 mm was 10.1 and 13.9% higher for magnetized and ionized water than pure groundwater, respectively. WUE was highest for 120 mm, at 28.0 and 30.3 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for magnetized and ionized water, respectively. WUE at 120 mm was 22.3 and 22.1 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for irrigation with magnetized and ionized water, 8.8 and 7.9% higher, respectively, than with pure groundwater.					wang, yanhui/HPG-3348-2023; Wang, Li/AAE-6919-2022														0342-7188	1432-1319				MAR	2021	39	2					263	276		10.1007/s00271-020-00706-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00271-020-00706-y		OCT 2020											WOS:000583100900001

Despite being the largest producer, consumer, and exporter of chickpea in Africa, insect pest infestations have caused significant losses to Ethiopia's chickpea industry. Results showed that Callosobruchus chinensis (L.) was the most prevalent insect species, followed by Sitophilus oryzae (L.) and Tribolium confusum (J. du Val). The insect pests infested both local and improved chickpea varieties, and traditional containers and polypropylene bags were used for storage. The percentage of insect-damaged seed ranged from 4.61% to 14.48%, while the seed weight loss ranging from 1.13% to 4.55%. The range of seed germination percentages was from 65% to 88%, with a mean rate of 71%. These losses significantly affect the market value of the crop as grain and its use as seed, affecting farmers' income and food security. Therefore, it is crucial to develop effective solutions to prevent the loss of farm-stored chickpea in Ethiopia.						berhe, muez/0000-0002-9989-9102														2405-8440				JUL	2023	9	7							e17826	10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e17826	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e17826		JUN 2023						37449153					WOS:001039966100001

It is composed of respiration by roots and heterotrophic organisms, with each component having distinctive drivers and sensitivities and, consequently, varying feedback potential to climate change. Global drivers of the total flux of R-S are widely studied and generally accepted, but our understanding of the factors governing its component fluxes lags far behind. Location Global. Time period 1962-2015. Major taxa studied Plant roots and soil microbes. Methods Combining a newly updated global database of R-S partitioning measurements with biotic and abiotic variables, we examined the world-wide distribution of the proportion of the annual root respiration (R-root) contribution to R-S (R-root:R-S). We investigated how R-root:R-S varies by ecosystem type, measurement method and climate. We used a random forest model to predict the relationship between field measurements of R-root:R-S (n = 880) and 14 biotic and abiotic factors, including climate, nitrogen deposition, soil, mycorrhiza, biomass and satellite-derived greenness. Finally, we present a global map of predicted R-root:R-S at 0.5 degrees resolution. Results Consistent with previous studies, we found no clear trends of mean R-root:R-S across ecosystem types and measurement methods. The area-weighted overall mean of predicted R-root:R-S was .42 (SD +/- .18; i.e., 42% of total global R-S was generated by plant roots). Predicted R-root:R-S and related environmental factors did exhibit clear spatial patterns between climatic regions, with higher R-root:R-S in dry and cold regions and lower R-root:R-S in temperate and tropical regions. Main conclusions Given that R-root:R-S is linked to plant carbon use efficiency (CUE, the ratio of net primary production to gross primary production), but generated from measurements completely independent of plant CUE, it might provide crucial insights into ecosystem- to global-scale carbon cycling. This study thus provides a framework to explore global carbon allocation under global climate change.

J	Li, XD; Shao, MA; Zhao, CL; Jia, XX				Li Xiangdong; Shao Ming'an; Zhao Chunlei; Jia Xiaoxu			Spatial variability of soil water content and related factors across the Hexi Corridor of China	JOURNAL OF ARID LAND												Soil water content (SWC) is a key factor limiting ecosystem sustainability in arid and semi-arid areas of the Hexi Corridor of China, which is characterized by an ecological environment that is vulnerable to climate change. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the large-scale spatial distribution of SWC in this region. The specific objectives of this study were to determine the spatial distribution patterns of SWC across the Hexi Corridor and identify the factors responsible for spatial variation of SWC at a regional scale. This study collected and analyzed SWC in the 0-100 cm soil profile from 109 field sampling sites (farmland, grassland and forestland) across the Hexi Corridor in 2017. We selected 17 factors, including land use, topography (latitude, longitude, elevation, slope gradient, and slope aspect), soil properties (soil clay content, soil silt content, soil bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, field capacity, and soil organic carbon content), climate factors (mean annual precipitation, potential evaporation, and aridity index), plant characteristic (vegetation coverage) and planting pattern (irrigation or rain-fed), as possible environmental variables to analyze their effects on SWC. The results showed that SWC was 0.083 (+/- 0.067) g/g in the 0-100 cm soil profile and decreased in the order of farmland, grassland and forestland. The SWC in the upper soil layers (0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) had obvious difference when the mean annual precipitation differed by 200 mm. The SWC decreased from southeast to northwest following the same pattern as precipitation, and had a moderate to strong spatial dependence in a large effective range (75-378 km). The SWC showed a similar distribution and had no significant difference between soil layers in the 0-100 cm soil profile. The principal component analysis showed that the mean annual precipitation, geographical position (longitude and latitude) and soil properties (soil bulk density and soil clay content) were the main factors dominating the variance of environmental variables. A stepwise linear regression equation showed that plant characteristic (vegetation coverage) and soil properties (soil organic carbon content, field capacity and soil clay content) were the optimal factors to predict the variation of SWC. Soil clay content could be better to explain the SWC variation in the deeper soil layers compared with the other factors.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				FEB	2019	11	1					123	134		10.1007/s40333-018-0123-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-018-0123-x													WOS:000458965000011

However, there are different sources of uncertainty in projecting future ETp that may arise from global climate models (GCMs), emission scenarios, and multiple ETp models used. In this study, we developed three random forest-based (RF-based) ETp models with solar radiation and air temperature at eight climatic stations in southeastern Australia. With Penman model as the benchmark, their performance was firstly compared with four empirical models (Jensen-Haise, Makkink, Abtew, and Hargreaves), which requires the same meteorological inputs. In general, the RF-based ETp models showed better performance in ETp estimates across all stations, with coefficients of determination (R-2) ranging from 0.68 to 0.92, root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.58 mm day(-1) to 1.46 mm day(-1), and relative mean bias errors (rMBE) ranging from -16.10% to 9.73%. The RF-based and empirical models were then used to project future ETp for the eight stations based on statistically downscaled daily climatic data from 34 GCMs under two different representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). All models indicated that ETp was likely to increase at the eight stations. The ensemble increases of mean ETp across eight stations ranged from 33 mm year(-1) (2.1%, 2040s) to 129 mm year(-1) (9.2%, 2090s) and from 43 mm year(-1) (2.8%, 2040s) to 248 mm year(-1) (17.6%, 2090s) under RCP4.5 and under RCP8.5, respectively. In addition, we also quantified uncertainties in ETp projections originating from ETp models, GCMs, RCPs, and their combined effects using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. Results showed that RCP-related uncertainty contributed the most to projected ETp uncertainty (around 40% for most stations) while GCM-related and ETp model-related uncertainties accounted for roughly equal amounts of projected ETp uncertainty (10%-30%). This study demonstrated the better performance of RF-based ETp models. It is advisable to use multiple ETp models driven by various GCMs under different RCPs to produce reliable projections of future ETp.

Methods Plants were grown in a calcareous soil supplied with different rates of Zn (0, 200, and 800 mg kg(-1)) and P (0, 20, and 80 mg kg(-1)). Plant dry mass, Zn and P concentrations in shoots and roots, bulk soil and rhizosheath pH, rhizosheath carboxylates, and DTPA-extractable Zn concentration in the bulk soil were determined. Results Phosphorus-Zn interaction significantly affected DTPA-extractable Zn concentration, plant dry mass, accumulation of Zn and P, and partitioning of Zn in alfalfa, but did not affect rhizosheath pH or the amounts of rhizosheath carboxylates. Increasing P rate promoted plant growth at all soil Zn rates and might enhance the plants' capacity to cope with excessive Zn; it resulted in a lower rhizosheath pH, which likely contributed to greater Zn and P uptake. Zinc deficiency enhanced exudation of citrate, malonate and malate, while the release of tartrate was related with P deficiency. Conclusions There are strong P-Zn interactions in calcareous soil-plant system, such interactions significantly affect Zn bioavailability, plant growth, accumulation of Zn and P, and partitioning of Zn in alfalfa. Rational P fertilization should be considered for efficient Zn biofortification on Zn-deficient soils and phytoremediation of Zn-contaminated soils.

One of the most notable policies is ecological restoration engineering. However, there are many environmental factors that affect vegetation in the ecological restoration engineering zones. The relationships among different factors cannot be explained well by traditional statistical methods due to the existence of hidden non-linear features. Moreover, it is difficult to adopt threshold methods to accurately define vegetation areas fully, or to quantitatively analyze and assess the effects of climate factors and human activities on vegetation changes. The objective of this study was to determine vegetation area and distribution using Landsat TM/ETM/OLI images combined with a support vector machine (SVM) classification model. We analyzed the dynamic characteristics of vegetation area and greenness (NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in China's ecological restoration engineering zones from 1990 to 2015. Based on random forest regression (RFR) with a residual analysis method, the contributions of meteorological factors and human activities to vegetation greenness changes were quantitatively evaluated. Vegetation area and NDVI changed significantly in the study areas, increasing by more than 50% and 40%, respectively, from 1990 to 2015. Temperature, sunshine hours, and precipitation impacted vegetation greenness, which caused NDVI fluctuations in specific years. However, the NDVI increase was difficult to explain fully with meteorological factors. Using cross-validation, we predicted about 80% of the observed NDVI variation occurring from 1984 to 1994. Nine meteorological factors were related to vegetation growth, of which the average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and average relative humidity were most critical. The combined effect of the nine climatic factors contributed less to NDVI increase than human activities. Human activity was the most important factor associated with NDVI increase, with contributions of more than 100% in most study areas. Human activities derived from national or local policies had large impacts on vegetation changes. The methods and results of this study can help to understand vegetation changes observed in ecological zones and provide guidance for evaluating ecological restoration policies.

J	Zhang, CJ; He, HM; Mokhtar, A				Zhang, Chuangjuan; He, Hongming; Mokhtar, Ali			The Impact of Climate Change and Human Activity on Spatiotemporal Patterns of Multiple Cropping Index in South West China	SUSTAINABILITY												Agricultural lands are very sensitive to climate and human activity changes, which result in variations in regional agricultural resources and decreased production of total grain output and increased difficulty in producing grain yields. Multiple cropping is one of the simplest ways to increase grain production. The research aims is to analyze the spatial and temporal variations in the multiple cropping index and study the factors that influence the multiple cropping index. Based on the maximum multiple cropping index (MCI) and a "heat-precipitation" quantitative relation model, we analyzed the theoretical potential multiple cropping index (PMCI) and the spatiotemporal changes in the potential increase in the multiple cropping index (PIMCI). Our results are as follows: The MCI was significantly higher in the eastern region than in the western region and higher in the central region than in the northern and southern regions; in Yunnan Province, it showed a fluctuating downwards trend; further, it exhibited sudden declines from 2004 to 2006 and from 2012 to 2014 in Guizhou, while it exhibited an increasing trend in Sichuan Province. The PMCIs were the highest in the eastern and southern regions, especially in eastern Sichuan Province, and the PIMCI was significantly higher in Yunnan Province than in Guizhou and Sichuan. Climate change, human activities, and terrain had significant influences on the MCI changes in southwest China, especially the temperature change, which was the key factor affecting the MCI changes. The dominant land use types in southwest China were forest (46%), grass (28%), and farmland (23%) during 1980-2015. Therefore, the adjustment of the planting structure in different terrain areas according to the temperature changes has become the main strategy to promote the sustainable development of cultivated land resources in the region, further, the results would help implement the plan to increase grain production capacity in southwest China.

The back contact electrode connection is performed by film transfer rather than by vacuum deposition or by wet processing, allowing the formation of highly homogeneous contacts under ambient conditions. The use of this novel electrode in solar cells based on CsPbBr3 resulted in efficiency of 5.8% without a hole transporting layer; it is significantly improved in comparison to the reference cells with standard gold electrodes. Overall device fabrication can be performed on air, using inexpensive processing methods. The hybrid film electrodes dramatically improve the cell photo-stability under ambient conditions and under real-life operating conditions outdoors. The champion unencapsulated device demonstrated less than 30% efficiency loss over 6 weeks of outdoor aging in Negev desert conditions. The CNT/PDI electrodes offer the combination of fabrication simplicity, unique contacting approach, high efficiency and good operational stability for perovskite photovoltaics.

However, poor urban land use planning caused remarkable impacts on the loss of potentially arable land. This study aimed to analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of urban and peri-urban expansion and its impact on arable land in the Shire Indaselassie city, North Western Tigray. Multi-temporal and spectral Landsat images were used as an input and processed using TerrSet, ERDAS imagine 2015, and ArcGIS 10.8.1 softwares. The Cellular Automata-Markov Chain model was used to predict the future urban and peri-urban areas. Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to examine the association among the population, urban, peri-urban growth, and its impact on arable land in Stata/SE v14. The findings revealed that urban and peri-urban lands increased by 7.5 km(2) (22.1%) and 1.0 km(2) (2.9%), while arable land decreased by - 0.1 km(2) (- 0.2%) from 1976 to 2019. It is also predicted to increase by 1.0 km(2) (2.80%) and 0.9 km(2) (2.70%) until 2029, while arable land is anticipated to shrink by - 1.0 km(2) (- 3.0%). The relationship among population growth, urban, and peri-urban land shows positive (r = 0.942, p = 0.058; r = 0.985, p = 0.016). However, arable land has been negatively correlated with population growth, urban, and peri-urban lands (r = - 0.610, p = 0.392). The result of this research is indispensable for urban planners and decision makers to optimize urban and peri-urban expansion related information without jeopardizing the size of arable lands.

In most crop simulation models, temperature response functions of development rate during the reproductive growth period (RGP) are assumed to only vary with temperature and not with other environmental factors. However, studies have indicated that the response functions may be plastic with other factors. Until now, little attention has been paid to this type of response. Here, using extensively collected field observations and data from intentionally designed interval planting experiments with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), and spring maize (Zea mays L.), we show that temperature response functions during RGP are plastic with day of year of flowering/heading (DOYR). Coefficients of determination between DOYR and development rate were significant for 69% sites. Partial correlation coefficients between development rate, temperature, and DOYR suggest that DOYR explains almost the same variability in maturity date as temperature. The plastic model was developed by coupling DOYR with a linear temperature response function. The model can improve the fitting efficiency by 112%, while dependency between DOYR and temperature explains less than 25% of this improvement. The average RMSEs of simulated maturity date estimated by the plastic model in the three crops were 2.1, 2.5, and 3.7 d, respectively, while the corresponding values given by widely applied traditional models were 3.1, 6.5, and 7.4 d, respectively. Therefore, the plastic model can reduce simulation error by half. Moreover, simulation errors resulting from the plastic model have less systematic bias than traditional models. The plastic model simply and effectively provides accurate estimates of crop maturity and reduces the system deviation of the estimates. Coupling the plastic model of crop development with crop simulation models will likely decrease uncertainties in simulated yield under warming conditions. Additionally, results of this study will encourage future studies of other phenotype plasticity considered in current crop simulation models.					yang, jianying/N-4615-2013; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009	Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Wang, Peijuan/0000-0003-3648-1355; Wu, Dingrong/0000-0002-1400-9108													0168-1923	1873-2240				JAN 15	2020	280								107770	10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.107770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.107770													WOS:000525807000007
J	Feng, PY; Wang, B; Liu, DL; Waters, C; Yu, Q				Feng, Puyu; Wang, Bin; Liu, De Li; Waters, Cathy; Yu, Qiang			Incorporating machine learning with biophysical model can improve the evaluation of climate extremes impacts on wheat yield in south-eastern Australia	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Accurately assessing the impacts of extreme climate events (ECEs) on crop yield can help develop effective agronomic practices to deal with climate change impacts. Process-based crop models are useful tools to evaluate climate change impacts on crop productivity but are usually limited in modelling the effects of ECEs due to over-simplification or vague description of certain process and uncertainties in parameterization. In this study, we firstly developed a hybrid model by incorporating the APSIM model outputs and growth stage-specific ECEs indicators (i.e. frost, drought and heat stress) into the Random Forest (RF) model, with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model as a benchmark. The results showed that the APSIM + RF hybrid model could explain 81% of the observed yield variations in the New South Wales wheat belt of south-eastern Australia, which had a 33% improvement in modelling accuracy compared to the APSIM model alone and 19% improvement compared to the APSIM + MLR hybrid model. Drought events during the grain-filling and vegetative stages and heat events immediately prior to anthesis were identified as the three most serious ECEs causing yield losses. We then compared the APSIM + RF hybrid model with the APSIM model to estimate the effects of future climate change on wheat yield. It was interesting to find that future yield projected from single APSIM model might have a 1-10% overestimation compared to the APSIM + RF hybrid model. The APSIM + RF hybrid model indicated that we were underestimating the effects of climate change and future yield might be lower than predicted using single APSIM informed modelling due to lack of adequately accounting for ECEs-induced yield losses. Increasing heat events around anthesis and grain-filling periods were identified to be major factors causing yield losses in the future. Therefore, we conclude that including the effects of ECEs on crop yield is necessary to accurately assess climate change impacts. We expect our proposed hybrid-modelling approach can be applied to other regions and crops and offer new insights of the effects of ECEs on crop yield.

Simulated soil column experiments are used to investigate the effects of caliche nodules on soil profile water distribution and soil water estimation under given water supply conditions. The results indicate that for the treatments with five caliche nodules contents (CNC = 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40%), except for the top 0-0.1m soil layer, the soil water content (SWC) of other layers is significantly different between the treatments (P< 0.05). The SWC is positively correlated to CNC. There are significant differences (P< 0.05) in caliche nodule water content (CWC) in the top three soil layers for all treatments. For soils with less than 10% caliche nodules, the soil water storage (SWS) in deeper soil layer (0.3-0.4 m) is significantly higher than that in surface soil layers (P< 0.05). Caliche nodule water storage (CWS) and available caliche nodule water storage (ACWS) both increase with increasing CNC. Water storage in the caliche nodules increases with the increase in CNC. There are significant differences in ACWS among soil layers in all soils (P< 0.05). The total ACWS significantly increases with the increase in CNC (P< 0.01). If water is absorbed by caliche nodules, then the total water storage of soils with CNCs of 10, 20, 30, and 40% would be underestimated by 3, 8, 10, and 17%, respectively. This study contributes to accurate soil water estimation in soils with caliche nodules and provide a scientific basis for rational utilization of soil and water resources.

However, it remains unclear if these phenomena result in corresponding alterations in the microbial characteristics of rhizosphere soil and diverse responses to nitrogen (N) deposition. This study evaluated microbial biomass, gas flow, and enzyme activity in rhizosphere soil of three root diameter classes (R1, <0.5 mm; R2, 0.5-1.0 mm; R3, 1.0-2.0 mm) of P. tabuliformis, and their responses to N application (0, 3, 6, 9 g N m(-2) y(-1), corresponding to CN, LN, MN, and HN) in a P. tabuliformis forest. Rhizosphere soil of R1 exhibited significantly higher microbial biomass N (MBN) content, enzyme activities, CO2 and N2O flow rates than those of R2 and R3 (P < 0.05). Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and phosphorus (MBP) contents, N2O and CH4 flow rates significantly increased with N applications. While soil MBN content increased with the LN treatment and decreased with the HN treatment, the largest value was observed in the LN treatment (84.89 mg kg(-1)). N application promoted Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alanine transaminase (ALT) activities in R1 rhizosphere soil while decreasing their activities in R2 and R3 rhizosphere soils. Moreover, beta-glucosidase (BG), N-acetyl-beta-Glucosaminidase (NAG), beta-xylosidase (XYL), and beta-D-cellulosidase (CBH) activities in R1 rhizosphere soil were inhibited, while their activities in R2 and R3 rhizosphere soils were promoted by N application. N application directly promoted microbial biomass then inhibited enzyme activity. Besides, nutrient content of rhizosphere soil decreased with root diameters, which indirectly reducing enzyme activity and microbial biomass. N application directly affected soil CH4 flow rate, while N2O flow rate was indirectly promoted by N application through increasing microbial biomass. CO2 and CH4 flow rates were inhibited by N application through decreasing enzyme activity. Root diameter slowed down the CO2 and CH4 flow rates by reducing soil nutrient content and enzyme activity. In conclusion, N deposition has varied effects on microbial characteristics in rhizosphere soil of different diameter roots, which are relevant to the corresponding changes in root system and soil properties.

J	Shi, LJ; Feng, PY; Wang, B; Liu, DL; Yu, Q				Shi, Lijie; Feng, Puyu; Wang, Bin; Liu, De Li; Yu, Qiang			Quantifying future drought change and associated uncertainty in southeastern Australia with multiple potential evapotranspiration models	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Projection of drought under a changing climate is important for drought risk assessment. Changes in precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (ETp) are expected to influence future drought occurrence. Thus, it is important to include both factors to accurately quantify change in drought frequency under future climate scenarios. Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) is a widely used index in drought assessment because it considers the influence of both P and ETp on drought. Thus, in this study we used SPEI to quantify change in drought frequency under two different emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in the wheat belt of southeastern Australia with climatic data downscaled from 34 global climate models (GCMs). We also investigated whether differences ETp models would make a difference on drought projection. Therefore, we employed five different traditional ETp models (Penman, Jensen-Haise, Makkink, Abtew, Hargreaves) and three random forest (RF)-based models to calculate SPEI in this study. Results showed that drought, especially moderate and severe drought, would occur more frequently under future climate scenarios and the increased frequency was generally greater in spring and winter than in summer and autumn. Severe drought occurring in spring would increase by 3.1%-21.7% under RCP4.5 and 5.2%-41.0% under RCP8.5. In autumn, the likely mean increase of severe drought frequency was 0.7%-13.0% under RCP4.5 and 2.7%-27.9% under RCP8.5. Differences in the projected increase of drought frequency were found among the different ETp models. In general, RF-based ETp models, which projected larger increases in ETp, generally also projected larger increases in drought occurrence. A multilinear regression relationship was built between changes in drought frequency and changes in ETp and P. The regression showed that the increased drought frequency was a combined result of the increasing ETp and decreasing P, and that the increasing ETp might be the more dominant factor. The contribution of GCMs, RCPs, different ETp models, and their interaction to the uncertainty in drought projection was quantified with the use of analysis of variance. Results showed that GCMs and their interaction with RCPs were the dominant factors influencing uncertainty in drought projection.

J	Aryal, SK; Silberstein, RP; Fu, GB; Hodgson, G; Charles, SP; McFarlane, D				Aryal, Santosh K.; Silberstein, Richard P.; Fu, Guobin; Hodgson, Geoff; Charles, Stephen P.; McFarlane, Don			Understanding spatio-temporal rainfall-runoff changes in a semi-arid region	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The rainfall-runoff response in arid and semi-arid regions is very different from that in humid or temperate regions due to factors including the relative difference in magnitude of rainfall and potential evaporation and the absence of sustained base flow. Despite being infrequent and of short duration, rainfall and runoff events sustain regional ecosystems through flooding and groundwater recharge. Understanding spatial and temporal hydrological patterns and their changes together with inter-relations of hydrological variables can provide insight into the current and future water resource in these regions. However, scarcity of data, small numbers of flow events and access difficulties make study of arid zone hydrology difficult. This study carried out quantitative hydrological analysis using regional-scale data from a semi-arid region in northern Western Australia and compared the findings with those from other similar regions of the world. We found that the regional runoff showed a spatial pattern that does not correlate closely with the rainfall across the region. The mean peak annual floods per unit catchment area were similar to those from many other arid and semi-arid regions of the world, despite cyclonic rainfall. Furthermore, the annual runoff showed high temporal and spatial variations with little to no carry-over from the past at an annual time scale. We found statistically significant covariance between the hydrological variables such as mean annual runoff, number of flow days, high flows and drought-like conditions. The mean annual runoff and runoff ratio however showed no significant correlation with catchment area. Despite increasing trends in annual and seasonal rainfall in recent years, the annual and seasonal flow trends were quite small and exhibited much lower rainfall elasticity of runoff than in other semi-arid regions across the world. However, part of the region had a 44% increase in rainfall during a 7-year period, which nearly doubled the runoff. Annual and seasonal runoff trends can be considerably different from corresponding rainfall trends for a variety of reasons. Runoff spatial variability patterns may not follow the rainfall spatial variability. Mean annual runoff can be uncorrelated to catchment area or mean annual rainfall in semi-arid regions. Despite prevalence of cyclonic rainfalls, mean annual peak flows in the Pilbara semi-arid study region are similar to those in most other semi-arid regions elsewhere.

However, various mulching applications under different tillage practices, whether it can improve the root growth, spatial distribution of root, nutrients uptake and grain yield of wheat is not clear. Therefore, a two years field study was carried out during 2016-17 and 2017-18 to evaluate root growth, nutrients uptake, and wheat production under six treatments: CT: conventional planting; SM: wheat stalk mulching; FM: plastic mulching; RT: without plastic mulching with furrow and ridge planting; RP: plastic mulching with furrow and ridge planting; RPS: plastic mulching on ridges and stalk mulching on furrows. Under the RPS treatment, root biomass, soil moisture, soil enzymatic activity, and microbial abundance can be significantly improved, thus promoting root growth, nutrient absorption, and wheat production. The RPS treatment significantly improved the rooting system in the upper soil profile of 50 cm, which helped increase the yield of wheat. At various wheat growth stages, the RPS and RT treatment at the depth of 10-50 cm significantly increased root bleeding saps, and RLD, and reached up to the highest value at 125 DAP. However, there were no differences in RLD between the six different treatment methods in deeper soil profiles below 60 cm. In addition, during 2016-17 and 2017-18, the NH4+ and NO3- delivery rates under the RPS were significantly higher than that of FM and RT, while the delivery rates of NH4+ and NO3- under the RP treatment were maximum compared with FM practice. Under the RPS and RT treatments, the Fe, Ca, P, Zn, K, and Mg delivery rates were significantly maximum. In summary, RPS farming practices have been great potential to improve the rhizosphere environment, root biomass, and wheat yield in semi-arid regions.

Soil moisture controls the spatio-temporal pattern of soil respiration under different land use systems in a semi-arid ecosystem of Delhi, India	ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES												Background Soil respiration (S-R) is a critical process for understanding the impact of climatic conditions and land degradation on the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. We measured the S-R and soil environmental factors over 1 year in four land uses with varying levels of disturbance and different vegetation types viz., mixed forest cover (MFC), Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) forest cover (PFC), agricultural field (AF), and vegetable field (VF), in a semi-arid area of Delhi, India. Our primary aim was to assess the effects of soil moisture (S-M), soil temperature (S-T), and soil microbial activity (S-MA) on the S-R. Methods The S-R was measured monthly using an LI-6400 with an infrared gas analyser and a soil chamber. The S-M was measured using the gravimetric method. The S-T (10 cm) was measured with a probe attached to the LI-6400. The S-MA was determined by fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. Results The S-R showed seasonal variations, with the mean annual S-R ranging from 3.22 to 5.78 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and higher S-R rates of similar to 15-55% in the cultivated fields (AF, VF) than in the forest sites (MFC, PFC). The VF had significantly higher S-R (P < 0.05) than the other land uses (AF, PFC, MFC), which did not vary significantly from one another in S-R (P < 0.05). The repeated measures ANOVA evaluated the significant differences (P < 0.05) in the S-R for high precipitation months (July, August, September, February). The S-M as a single factor showed a strong significant relationship in all the land uses (R-2 = 0.67-0.91, P < 0.001). The effect of the S-T on the S-R was found to be weak and non-significant in the PFC, MFC, and AF (R-2 = 0.14-0.31; P > 0.05). Contrasting results were observed in the VF, which showed high S-R during summer (May; 11.21 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and a significant exponential relationship with the S-T (R-2 = 0.52; P < 0.05). The S-R was positively related to the S-MA (R-2 = 0.44-0.5; P < 0.001). The interactive equations based on the independent variables S-M, S-T, and S-MA explained 91-95% of the seasonal variation in S-R with better model performance in the cultivated land use sites (AF, VF). Conclusion S-M was the key determining factor of the S-R in semi-arid ecosystems and explained similar to 90% of the variation. Precipitation increased S-R by optimizing the S-M and microbial activity. The S-MA, along with the other soil factors S-M and S-T, improved the correlation with S-R. Furthermore, the degraded land uses will be more susceptible to temporal variations in S-R under changing climatic scenarios, which may influence the carbon balance of these ecosystems.

The objective of this study was to suggest efficient crop-growth-stage-based deficit irrigation strategies for cotton under nine different climate variability classes using the CROPGRO-Cotton module available in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) Cropping System Model (CSM). Cotton growth stages considered in this study include: i) germination and seedling emergence (GS1), ii) squaring (GS2), iii) flower initiation/early bloom (GS3), iv) peak bloom (GS4), and v) cutout, late bloom and boll opening stage (GS5). The amount of seasonal irrigation water applied was varied from 120 to 540 mm under eight different irrigation scheduling scenarios with four irrigation application rates of 3, 6, 8 and 9 mm d(-1) using the subsurface drip irrigation method. Under each scenario, six growth-stage-based irrigation treatments were adopted, resulting in a total of 48 irrigation strategies. Results indicated that imposing water deficit in the initial (GS1 to GS2) or final (GS5) growth stages had little effect on seed cotton yield. The peak bloom growth stage (GS4) was found to be the most sensitive stage to water stress, and imposing water deficit during this stage resulted in the lowest irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) and seed cotton yield under most climate variability classes. Application of higher than 420 mm irrigation did not significantly contribute to an increase in seed cotton yield and resulted in a decline in IWUE. The results from this study are useful for the SHP producers to make appropriate crop-growth-stage-based deficit irrigation management decisions for achieving higher seed cotton yield while conserving precious irrigation water resources from the Ogallala Aquifer.

Firstly, we constructed a 3D orchard point cloud map and set up navigation path points on the projected map. Secondly, we developed a master-slave command-based cooperative navigation strategy, where the spraying robot was the master and the dosing robot was the slave. Finally, the spraying robot and the dosing robot completed the cooperative navigation on the constructed map by using the pure pursuit algorithm and D-A control algorithm, respectively. To validate the cooperative navigation system, we conducted field tests on the separate communication and navigation control. The results of communication experiments demonstrated that the packet loss rate was less than 5%, which satisfied communication requirements. The experimental results of the navigation control demonstrated that the maximum value of the absolute lateral error is 24.9 cm for the spraying robot and 29.7 cm for the dosing robot. The collaborative navigation system proposed in this research can meet the automatic navigation requirements of the spraying-dosing robot group for collaborative tasks in traditional orchards.																				2073-4395				DEC	2022	12	12							3114	10.3390/agronomy12123114	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12123114													WOS:000900399500001

In particular, the emergence of rice farming and transition to sedentary life contributed significantly to the development of water management practices, with increasing labour and economic investments to build and operate water-management infrastructures. Here we present archaeological, archaeobotanical and geoarchaeological evidence of early water management obtained from the excavations of three early-to-middle Holocene sites in the upper and middle Huai River region (UMHR), including Hanjing from Sihong County of Jiangsu Province and Xielaozhuang and Zhangwangzhuang from Luohe City and Zhumadian City of Henan Province. Our 14C dates suggest multiple episodes of regional inhabitation in the UMHR region. Our results also reveal that the wells at Xielaozhuang represent some of the earliest attempts to ensure water consumption in the village, and importantly, the rice-field-like structures at Hanjing and Zhangwangzhuang are evidence of a more systematic effort to modify and transform local landscapes for rice cultivation and related economic activities. In line with the results from published phytolith studies, we found that the early experiment of rice cultivation altered local soil and hydrological conditions at these sites. These early forms of rice fields share some similarities in micro-and-macro- morphologies and represent successful adaptations to the low-lying plains that continued to have fluctuating hydrological regimes. The construction and operation of these wells, moats and rice-field-like structures stimulated collaboration beyond individual households and groups in these early-to-middle Holocene villages in the UMHR region and thus would have had profound social and economic ramifications.

Merr.) and other species as these metrics may be valuable for assessing moisture stress and for screening of drought-resistant varieties. To this end, we examined the response of six soybean genotypes to water-deficit stress in a greenhouse study. Two treatments were imposed: low soil moisture (5-10% volumetric water content) and high soil moisture (30-38% volumetric water content). Above-ground biomass accumulation, foliar N, and delta C-13 were measured at the end of the experiment. Leaf water potential and midday gas exchange (net assimilation, stomatal conductance, and transpiration) were measured multiple times throughout the experiment. All measurements were affected by water-deficit stress. Significant, but weak, positive relationships were found between delta C-13 and biomass accumulation in both soil moisture treatments. Foliar N was significantly, but weakly, correlated to growth in the high soil-moisture treatment, but not in the low soil-moisture treatment. The data suggest that selection for genotypes with higher delta C-13 values could result in improved biomass accumulation. The relationship between foliar N and delta C-13 was negative under high soil-moisture conditions and positive under low soil-moisture conditions. The relationships between delta C-13 and foliar N could be a highly informative metric to help understand the effects of water-deficit stress and may further indicate whether water or nitrogen acquisition is limiting in a specific environment, which should help in breeding improved soybean cultivars.																			1542-7528	1542-7536				JAN 2	2022	36	1					90	107		10.1080/15427528.2021.1910092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15427528.2021.1910092		APR 2021											WOS:000636596700001

However, the mechanisms by which natural vegetation restoration affects the extent, rate, and temperature sensitivity of DOM biodegradation are poorly understood. Elucidating these mechanisms is important for SOM management, especially in light of future climate warming scenarios. In this study, a laboratory DOM solution incubation experiment was conducted to comprehensively investigate the effects of temperature and natural vegetation restoration spanning a period of 160 y on DOM biodegradation in the Loess Plateau, China. The results indicated that dissolved organic C (DOC) biodegradation significantly decreased with vegetation restoration after an incubation period of 60 d. Further, biodegradation of dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved organic P (DOP) significantly decreased after farmland abandonment. Specifically, the lowest values were observed in pioneer (Populus davidiana) and mingled (Populus davidiana and Quercus liaotungensis) forests. Generally, an increase in temperature significantly promoted the biodegradation of DOC, DON, and DOP by enhancing the microbial utilisation efficiencies of recalcitrant humic substrates (i.e., low-molecular-weight humic materials). Our results suggest that DOM biodegradability and its temperature sensitivity were regulated by DOM substrate quality (i.e, recalcitrant humic materials), and microbial properties (i.e., gram-negative bacterial and fungal PLFA, enzyme activities). Additionally, our results suggest that climax forest communities (Quercus liaotungensis) played a vital role in reducing DOC and DOP losses. This could be attributed to the low Q10 of the DOC and DOP biodegradation rates. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Six dry land representative winter wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.) released from 1942 to 2004 in the Loess Plateau of China were investigated to determine how the yield components of winter wheat were associated with grain yield at the Changwu Agricultural Research Station during the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons, using a completely randomized block design with three replicates. Plant height, aboveground biomass, grain yield, and yield components were measured, together with the traits of superior and inferior grains and the pre-anthesis stored dry matter remobilized to the grain was determined. In the relatively wet 2011-2012 season, there was a significant increase in grain yield and aboveground biomass with the year of release, but not in the dry 2012-2013 season. The harvest index (HI) and average grain weight (AGW) increased significantly with the year of release in both cropping seasons. HI and AGW are likely potential traits for improving grain yield of winter wheat in the Loess Plateau. The increase in HI mainly resulted from the decrease in plant height, and the increase in the use of pre-anthesis stored assimilates for grain filling. The increase in AGW mainly resulted from the increase in the proportion of superior grain (SG) and the decrease in the proportion of inferior grain (IG) in the whole spike in both cropping seasons. Depending on the climatic conditions, the different winter wheat cultivars showed different ability to use pre-anthesis stored assimilates. Modern wheat cultivars had higher yield under different rainfall conditions, and high ability to use pre-anthesis stored assimilates to fill the grain than earlier released cultivars. Both, the increase in sink capacity and source availability, should be considered as a strategy for increasing future grain yield in Loess Plateau of China.

Farmers often sell their sesame seeds immediately after harvest at lower prices due to concerns about pest damage during storage. This study aimed to assess the impact of different storage containers and storage durations on reducing infestation by storage insect pests and minimizing losses of stored sesame seeds over a six-month period. The findings revealed that hermetic storage solutions, particularly PICS and SGP bags, effectively suppressed insect development, minimized losses, and maintained seed viability without the need for insecticides. Weight loss in PICS and SGP bags remained consistent regardless of the storage duration, whereas jute and PP bags exhibited a significant increase in weight loss. Lower seed germination rates were observed in PP and jute bags, whereas PICS and SGP bags maintained consistent germination rates throughout the storage period. PICS and SGP bags also exhibited a significant decrease in oxygen levels and an increase in carbon dioxide levels, contributing to the reduction in insect infestation. In comparison, traditional storage bags such as jute and PP bags exhibited higher insect counts, seed damage, and greater weight loss compared to hermetic bags. Therefore, hermetic storage solutions are recommended for farmers to minimize losses and preserve seed viability. During the study, three insect species were identified as the most prevalent in stored sesame seeds: Corcyra cephalonica, Tribolium spp (T. castaneum & T. confusum), and Rhyzopetha dominica. The maximum insect counts of these species were recorded in jute bags. At the beginning of the experiment, the average seed damage across all storage units was 1.9%, which increased to 14.1% in jute bags and 9.3% in PP bags after six months of storage.						berhe, muez/0000-0002-9989-9102													0022-474X	1879-1212				SEP	2023	103								102161	10.1016/j.jspr.2023.102161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2023.102161		JUL 2023											WOS:001047373300001

This study investigated the speciation and distribution of heavy metals in soil aggregates associated with GRSP through macroscopic and microscopic approaches. A field study showed that the metal ions were distributed to the macro-aggregate fraction by partitioning the particle size classes during phytoremediation. Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) demonstrated that the heavy metal bioavailability was negatively affected by aggregate stability (61.5%) and GRSP content (52.8%), suggesting that the soil aggregate properties regarding GRSP were vital drivers in mitigating environmental risk closely associated with toxic metal migration in soil-plant systems. The nonideal competitive adsorption (NICA)-Donnan model fitting suggested that GRSP were rich in acid site density, and the complexation with deprotonated groups dominated the speciation of heavy metals in soil. Further, the microfocus X-ray absorption/fluorescence spectroscopy analysis indicated that GRSP might promote the formation of stable metal species by binding with sulfur-containing sites. This study highlights the role of GRSP in heavy metal sequestration in contaminated soils, providing new guidance on the GRSP intervention for phytoremediation strategies.

The rhizobial Nod factor (NF) and type III secretion system (T3SS) are two key signaling pathways for establishing the legume-rhizobium symbiosis. However, whether NF signaling is involved in the nodulation of Robinia pseudoacacia and Mesorhizobium amorphae CCNWGS0123, and its symbiotic differences compared with T3SS signaling remain unclear. Therefore, to elucidate the function of NF signaling in nodulation, we mutated nodC in M. amorphae CCNWGS0123, which aborted NF synthesis. Compared with the plants inoculated with the wild type strain, the plants inoculated with the NF-deficient strain exhibited shorter shoots with etiolated leaves. These phenotypic characteristics were similar to those of the plants inoculated with the T3SS-deficient strain, which served as a Nod(-) (non-effective nodulation) control. The plants inoculated with both the NF- and T3SS-deficient strains formed massive root hair swellings, but no normal infection threads were detected. Sections of the nodules showed that inoculation with the NF- and T3SS-deficient strains induced small, white bumps without any rhizobia inside. Analyzing the accumulation of 6 plant hormones and the expression of 10 plant genes indicated that the NF- and T3SS-deficient strains activated plant defense reactions while suppressing plant symbiotic signaling during the perception and nodulation processes. The requirement for NF signaling appeared to be conserved in two other leguminous trees that can establish symbiosis with M. amorphae CCNWGS0123. In contrast, the function of the T3SS might differ among species, even within the same subfamily (Faboideae). Overall, this work demonstrated that nodulation of R. pseudoacacia and M. amorphae CCNWGS0123 was both NF and T3SS dependent.					liang, liang/IAO-8518-2023; Chen, Juan/GXF-5536-2022; liu, xq/JDW-2596-2023; Wang, Xin/GYU-1129-2022	Huo, Haibo/0000-0002-6823-1898													0829-318X	1758-4469				MAY	2021	41	5					817	835		10.1093/treephys/tpaa160	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpaa160								33219377					WOS:000656143200011

To date, the focus has been placed on the direct effects of warming on soil microbial communities, overlooking how concurrent changes in plant communities may mediate these effects. Additionally, few studies have examined long-term effects of warming in more than one environmental context. In the present study, we conducted a long-term simulated warming experiment to investigate how changes to the plant community within two different environmental contexts affect the responses of soil microorganisms and their respiration to warming. We analyzed the abundance, diversity, and community composition of plants and soil microbes, in addition to soil microbial interaction networks and soil microbial respiration, in two typical ecosystems of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Following long-term warming, the soil microbial composition, structure, and interactions changed, and the shifts depended on the aboveground plant type. Specifically, the co-occurring networks containing different microbial communities tended to be more complex in a shrubland than in a grassland after warming, leading to higher carbon use efficiency. Additionally, long-term warming changed the structure of soil microbial communities, increasing the relative abundances of oligotrophic taxa in the shrubland but not in the grassland. The shifts in community structure and interaction patterns could be explained by vegetation community attributes, highlighting the strong effect of plants on soil microbial responses. These plant-mediated effects on community structure and interactions subsequently could explain changes in soil microbial respiration rates. Microbial respiration showed a positive response to elevated temperature in the grassland but no response to temperature in the shrubland. These results indicate that interactions between soil microbial communities and plant communities determine how soil microbes respond to global warming. Therefore, future research on soil microbial community composition and associated carbon feedbacks to the climate change should include plant-mediated effects, which can provide a scientific basis for effectively mitigating global warming.					li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023; wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; chen, wenjing/IZE-8536-2023	WANG, jie/0009-0004-1824-7244													0341-8162	1872-6887				SEP	2021	204								105391	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105391		APR 2021											WOS:000657369600015

A four-year field experiment in split plot design was conducted to evaluate the effects of supplemental drip irrigation on grain yield, water use efficiency (WUE), nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), nitrogen (N) loss and economic benefits, keeping three supplemental drip irrigation times (DI0, no irrigation after emergence; DI3, irrigation once at wheat jointing, once at maize seedling and once at maize jointing; DI5, irri-gation once at wheat jointing, once at wheat anthesis, once at maize seedling, once at maize jointing and once at maize tasseling) in the main plots and three N fertilizer rates (N0, no N fertilizer; N60%, 60% of the local rec-ommended N fertilizer rate, 272 kg N ha- 1 yr -1; N100%, 100% of the local recommended N fertilizer rate, 453 kg N ha- 1 yr -1) in the sub plots. The traditional surface irrigation regime was also conducted as control (CK) under local recommended N fertilizer at 453 kg N ha- 1 yr -1. The results showed that DI5N60% achieved the highest WUE in wheat (1.93 kg m-3) and maize (3.00 kg m-3) on average, which was 3.0% and 25.3% higher compared to CK, respectively. The highest partial factor productivity from applied N (PEPN) in wheat and maize were also observed in DI5N60% (56.8 kg kg- 1 and 56.3 kg kg -1, respectively) on average, which was 54.0% and 74.0% higher compared to CK, respectively. For winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system, DI5N60% can generally achieve similar crop yield and net income but reduce irrigation and N fertilizer use and N loss compared to CK. Therefore, DI5N60% was considered as an alternative water-fertilizer-saving management practice for winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system in the NCP. Moreover, the optimized combi-nation of irrigation amount and N fertilizer rate corresponding simultaneously to higher crop yield, WUE and net income were determined by using the response surface methodology based on binary quadratic regression analysis, and the optimal irrigation amount were 165 mm and 90 mm, optimal N rates were 186 kg N ha- 1 and 185 kg N ha-1 for winter wheat and summer maize, respectively.

Interannual climate variability mediates changes in carbon and nitrogen pools caused by annual grass invasion in a semiarid shrubland	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Exotic plant invasions alter ecosystem properties and threaten ecosystem functions globally. Interannual climate variability (ICV) influences both plant community composition (PCC) and soil properties, and interactions between ICV and PCC may influence nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) pools. We asked how ICV and non-native annual grass invasion covary to influence soil and plant N and C in a semiarid shrubland undergoing widespread ecosystem transformation due to invasions and altered fire regimes. We sampled four progressive stages of annual grass invasion at 20 sites across a large (25,000 km(2)) landscape for plant community composition, plant tissue N and C, and soil total N and C in 2013 and 2016, which followed 2 years of dry and wet conditions, respectively. Multivariate analyses and ANOVAs showed that in invasion stages where native shrub and perennial grass and forb communities were replaced by annual grass-dominated communities, the ecosystem lost more soil N and C in wet years. Path analysis showed that high water availability led to higher herbaceous cover in all invasion stages. In stages with native shrubs and perennial grasses, higher perennial grass cover was associated with increased soil C and N, while in annual-dominated stages, higher annual grass cover was associated with losses of soil C and N. Also, soil total C and C:N ratios were more homogeneous in annual-dominated invasion stages as indicated by within-site standard deviations. Loss of native shrubs and perennial grasses and forbs coupled with annual grass invasion may lead to long-term declines in soil N and C and hamper restoration efforts. Restoration strategies that use innovative techniques and novel species to address increasing temperatures and ICV and emphasize maintaining plant community structure-shrubs, grasses, and forbs-will allow sagebrush ecosystems to maintain C sequestration, soil fertility, and soil heterogeneity.

Effect of IW:CPE-Based Irrigation Scheduling and N-Fertilization Rate on Yield, Water and N-Use Efficiency of Wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>)	AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Under emerging water scarcities in the face of global warming, optimization of irrigation and nutrient inputs is essential to maximize input-use efficiency. Thus, a field experiment was conducted with wheat for 2-years to evaluate the effects of N and deficit irrigations on yield formation, water productivity (WP) and nitrogen-uptake efficiency (NUE). Treatment consisted of combinations of four N application levels, i.e., 60, 90, 120 and 150 kg ha(-1) as main-plot factors and seven levels of irrigation water (IW; equaling 1.00, 0.85, 0.70, 0.55, 0.40, 0.25 and 0.10 times of the cumulative open pan evaporation, CPE) as sub-plot factors. After pre-plant and first post-planting irrigation through flood method, line-source sprinklers were used. Grain yield increased with applied N and was the maximum (3.39-4.66 Mg ha(-1)) at IW:CPE 0.85 and declined @ 0.67-0.81 Mg ha(-1) for every 0.1 IW:CPE. Application of 150 kg N ha(-1) improved the grain yield by 6.0-8.9% over 120 kg N ha(-1) under medium stress (IW:CPE 0.41-0.70) and no stress (> 0.70) conditions, but showed little impact under severe stress (0.10-0.40) conditions. Rather it declined by 45.3-66.1 and 13.0-26.1% at 60 and 90 kg N ha(-1) over 120 kg N ha(-1), respectively under the latter. The WP and NUE ranged between 1.28-1.36 kg m(-3) and 37.4-38.4%, respectively, with 120-150 kg N ha(-1), while the counter figures were 0.99 kg m(-3) and 30.2% with 60 kg N ha(-1). On the whole, results indicate basing N applications on the water availability for irrigation for optimal grain yields where, WP and NUE vis-a-vis benefits can be maximized under deficit irrigation conditions.

However, since 2010, this sector is constrained by the tomato leaf miner Tuta absoluta, which is considered one of the most destructive pests of tomato crops. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the mating disruption with TUTATEC (R) in tomato crops in heated greenhouses. The efficacy of TUTATEC (R) at the theoretical doses of 55.5 and 111 g active ingredient of sex pheromone per hectare (300 and 600 dispensers/ha) to control T. absoluta was compared with mechanical control (manual deleafing) and conventional insecticides (Azadirachtin, 10 g/L and Cyantraniliprole, 100 g/L). The number of trapped males in water traps as well as the percentages of infested leaves and fruits were monitored weekly and compared with manual deleafing and insecticide-treated greenhouses. In greenhouses disrupted with 300 and 600 dispensers/ha, a reduction of 47.79 and 63.01% in male trap captures was observed, respectively, compared with mechanical control. The leaf damage was significantly lower in greenhouses disrupted with 600 dispensers/ha and insecticide treated greenhouses, with a reduction of infestation 29.53% and 32.02%, respectively. No significant differences were found in fruit damage between greenhouses disrupted with 300 and 600 dispensers/ha and the mechanical control. These results suggest that mating disruption is effective in the management of T. absoluta, and could be used in the framework of Integrated Pest Management strategies to control this pest.																			0334-2123	1876-7184				2023 MAR 7	2023										10.1007/s12600-023-01047-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-023-01047-0		MAR 2023											WOS:000945994500002

Delineation of Soil Fertility Management Zones for Site-specific Nutrient Management in the Maize Belt Region of Nigeria	SUSTAINABILITY												Site-specific nutrient management can reduce soil degradation and crop production risks related to undesirable timing, amount, and type of fertilizer application. This study was conducted to understand the spatial variability of soil properties and delineate spatially homogenous nutrient management zones (MZs) in the maize belt region of Nigeria. Soil samples (n = 3387) were collected across the area using multistage and random sampling techniques, and samples were analyzed for pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), macronutrients (N, P, K, S, Ca and Mg), micronutrients (S, B, Zn, Mn and Fe) content, and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC). Spatial distribution and variability of these parameters were assessed using geostatistics and ordinary kriging, while principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate K-means cluster analysis were used to delineate nutrient management zones. Results show that spatial variation of macronutrients (total N, available P, and K) was largely influenced by intrinsic factors, while that of S, Ca, ECEC, and most micronutrients was influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors with moderate to high spatial variability. Four distinct management zones, namely, MZ1, MZ2, MZ3, and MZ4, were identified and delineated in the area. MZ1 and MZ4 have the highest contents of most soil fertility indicators. MZ4 has a higher content of available P, Zn, and pH than MZ1. MZ2 and MZ3, which constitute the larger part of the area, have smaller contents of the soil fertility indicators. The delineated MZs offer a more feasible option for developing and implementing site-specific nutrient management in the maize belt region of Nigeria.

However, there is little information on the interactions of nitrogen (N) enrichment and increased precipitation on soil microbial resource limitation in desert-shrubland ecosystems. Methods This study examined the effects of longterm (9 years) N and water (W) additions (i.e., 5 g N-m(-2)-year(-1) and 30% ambient precipitation increase, and their combination) on the activities of soil extracellular enzymes (EEAs) and soil microbial resource limitation in the Gurbantunggut Desert in northwestern China. Results N and W addition significantly enhanced soil microbial carbon (C) and phosphorus (P)-acquiring enzymes, and significantly induced microbial growth from N to P limitation in the desert ecosystem. Furthermore, W addition and simultaneous addition of N and W alleviated C limitation; however, N addition alone increased the microbial C limitation. Thus, the interaction alleviated the negative impact of N addition on soil microbial C limitation, but increased the microbial P limitation. Soil microbial C limitation was primarily driven by the soil available N/P ratio, whereas the soil microbial P limitation was primarily controlled by soil total N/P ratio. Conclusions The influence of either N or W addition on the biogeochemical processes in desert ecosystems can be altered by their concurrent addition. Overall, our findings showed that increased precipitation was more effective than N accumulation in modifying microbial metabolism in desert ecosystems, and this effect was co-regulated by the relative contents of N and P in the soil. These findings can aid in the prediction of terrestrial C and nutrient flows under global change.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564													0032-079X	1573-5036				JUN	2022	475	1-2			SI		361	378		10.1007/s11104-022-05371-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05371-y		MAR 2022											WOS:000773173400001

However, long-term Rs data are not available in most regions of China, impeding the management and development of PV systems. In this study, a novel model for estimating Rs was developed and coupled with a PV power model and inverse distance weighting model to generate high-resolution Rs and PV power data over China. A large network of observations was used to provide forcing inputs (daily observations from 1961 to 2018, from 2123 meteorological stations). The spatiotemporal patterns of Rs and PV power in China were further quantified. The results indicate that the newly developed Rs model accurately represents the decadal variability of Rs in China during 1961-2018. Annual potential PV power exhibited a significantly decreasing trend from 1961 to 2018, with a significant decrease from 1961 to 1991 (-0.35 +/- 0.06 kWh m- 2 yr- 1, p 0.01) and nonsignificant decrease from 1992 to 2018 (-0.14 +/- 0.12 kWh m- 2 yr- 1, p 0.05). Owing to air quality improvements in the future, the potential PV power may increase over China, leading to large economic benefits. Western China is favored for its abundant PV power, whereas central and eastern China are the least favorable for PV power generation. Thus, the western part of China, with its excellent geographical potential, is an optimal location for the installation of solar PV power plants. Our findings provide practical information to solar energy industries, and can help in energy structure transitions, meeting the energy demand and contributing to carbon neutrality.

Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of bread wheat, is a great gene source for wheat breeding; however, identifying suitable genes from Ae. tauschii is challenging due to the different morphology and the wide intra-specific variation within the species. In this study, we developed a platform for the systematic evaluation of Ae. tauschii traits in the background of the hexaploid wheat cultivar 'Norin 61' and thus for the identification of QTLs and genes. To validate our platform, we analyzed the seed dormancy trait that confers resistance to preharvest sprouting. We used a multiple synthetic derivative (MSD) population containing a genetic diversity of 43 Ae. tauschii accessions representing the full range of the species. Our results showed that only nine accessions in the population provided seed dormancy, and KU-2039 from Afghanistan had the highest level of seed dormancy. Therefore, 166 backcross inbred lines (BILs) were developed by crossing the synthetic wheat derived from KU-2039 with 'Norin 61' as the recurrent parent. The QTL mapping revealed one novel QTL, Qsd.alrc.5D, associated with dormancy explaining 41.7% of the phenotypic variation and other five unstable QTLs, two of which have already been reported. The Qsd.alrc.5D, identified for the first time within the natural variation of wheat, would be a valuable contribution to breeding after appropriate validation. The proposed platform that used the MSD population derived from the diverse Ae. tauschii gene pool and recombinant inbred lines proved to be a valuable platform for mining new and important QTLs or alleles, such as the novel seed dormancy QTL identified here. Likewise, such a platform harboring genetic diversity from wheat wild relatives could be a useful source for mining agronomically important traits, especially in the era of climate change and the narrow genetic diversity within the current wheat germplasm.

Detailed analyses of composition and C-13 isotopic ratios of fatty acids performed on potsherds from an archaeological horizon of a Keltaminar culture dated at 3000-4000 cal BC combined with analogical analyses of modern camel and horse milk samples from Uzbekistan indicated a plausible possibility that camels were kept and milked by stockbreeders of Ayakagytma during this time period. The observed herding practices based almost exclusively on camel husbandry, as opposed to earlier more balanced herds of cattle, horses and camels, were probably an adaptation to climate transition from relatively humid to relatively dry, and the following changes in vegetation. Such climatic shift did not correspond with the general trend of Holocene moisture changes over the Westerlies-dominated Central Asia. However, it was in accordance with wet-to-dry climate transitions recorded in sediments of several lakes in the same region at around 4000 cal BP. The observed changes in Neolithic stockbreeding practices, as other inconsistencies in Holocene moisture evolution over a massive area of arid Central Asia, may have resulted from local manifestations of globally-forced climate changes and/or from local hydrographic alterations unrelated to paleoclimate.

J	Scott, AC				Scott, Andrew C.			Charcoalified vegetation from the Pennsylvanian of Yorkshire, England: Implications for the interpretation of Carboniferous wildfires	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												New data on some fossil charcoal deposits from the British Isles is integrated into previous studies to provide an indication of our current understanding of the role of fire on land in the Pennsylvanian and also provide strategies for obtaining new information in the future. The nature and occurrence of fossil charcoal (often called fusain) in sediments and coals (often described as inertinite/fusinite/semi-fusinite) is the main way that the history of Carboniferous fire has been studied. Fires have been shown to have been common in many Carboniferous ecosystems around the world, yet we still have little understanding of the details of what these fires were, where and how they occurred, or their effects upon both on the local ecosystem and the Earth System as a whole. Research has demonstrated that detailed scanning electron microscope studies of charcoal residues can provide data on the plants that have been charred by wildfires. Information on the amount of charcoal in coal globally appears to relate to atmospheric oxygen composition and this shows that throughout the Carboniferous oxygen levels were as high or higher than those of the present day, suggesting that wildfires were more frequent. Interpreting the frequency of fires in different ecosystems remains fraught with difficulty and calculations within peat (coal) systems are at an early stage. The impact of fire on vegetational change as well as the relationship between fire and climate in the Carboniferous remains little studied. A study of the inertinite (charcoal) distribution within the Low Barnsley Seam in Yorkshire, England indicates that levels remained high throughout much of the 1.8m thick coal seam. A previous palynological study of the seam has demonstrated three repeated successions of vegetational development interpreted as repeated phases of wet to dry mire development (rheotrophic swamp to ombrotrophic bog). Inertinite peaks above 20% background have indicated a minimum of 18 significant large fire events and an analysis of depositional rates suggests a fire return interval of these large fires to be 500 years or less. A study of charcoalified vegetation from fine-grained clastic sediments from Swillington Brickworks, Yorkshire recovered from bulk maceration of the sediment, that was not evident from bedding surface examination, has demonstrated that some levels contain abundant leaf charcoal, mainly from pteridosperms, in addition to wood charcoal derived from a range of gymnosperms. The charcoalified plants are interpreted as wildfire residues mainly from surface fires that have been transported and deposited on low-lying floodplains. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Production in a Sub-Humid Climate	WATER												In sub-humid regions, declining maize (Zea mays L.) yield is majorly attributed to unreliable rainfall and high evapotranspiration demand during critical growth stages. However, there are limited farm technologies for conserving soil water and increasing water use efficiency (WUE) in rainfed production systems amidst a changing climate. This study aimed at assessing the performance of different climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices, such as mulching and permanent planting basins (PPB), on maize growth, yield, water use efficiency and soil moisture storage. Field experiments involving mulches of 2 cm (M_2 cm), 4 cm (M_4 cm) and 6 cm (M_6 cm) thickness, permanent planting basins of 20 cm (PPB_20 cm) and 30 cm (PPB_30 cm) depths and the control/or conventional treatments were conducted for three maize growing seasons in the sub-humid climate of Western Uganda. Results indicate that maize biomass significantly increased under the tested CSA practices in the study area. Use of permanent planting basins relatively increased maize grain yield (11-66%) and water use efficiency (33-94%) compared to the conventional practice. Additionally, plots treated with mulch achieved an increase in grain yield (18-65%) and WUE (28-85%) relative to the control. Soil amendment with M_4 cm and M_6 cm significantly increased soil moisture storage compared to permanent planting basins and the conventional practice. Overall, the results highlight the positive impact of CSA practices on improving maize yield and water use efficiency in rainfed agriculture production systems which dominate the sub-humid regions.

Inulinase is one of the most important industrial enzymes in the family of Glycoside Hydrolases 32 (GH32). In this study, to identify and classify bacterial inulinases initially, 16,002 protein sequences belonging to the GH32 family were obtained using various databases. The inulin-effective enzymes (endoinulinase and exoinulinase) were identified. Eight endoinulinases (EC 3.2.1.7) and 4318 exoinulinases (EC 3.2.1.80) were found. Then, the localization of endoinulinase and exoinulinase enzymes in the cell was predicted. Among them, two extracellular endoinulinases and 1232 extracellular exoinulinases were found. The biochemical properties of 363 enzymes of the genus Arthrobacter, Bacillus, and Streptomyces (most abundant) showed that exoinulinases have an acid isoelectric point up to the neutral range due to their amino acid length. That is, the smaller the protein (336 aa), the more acidic the pI (4.39), and the larger the protein (1207 aa), the pI is in the neutral range (8.84). Also, a negative gravitational index indicates the hydrophilicity of exoinulinases. Finally, considering the biochemical properties affecting protein stability and post-translational changes studies, one enzyme for endoinulinase and 40 enzymes with desirable characteristics were selected to identify their enzyme production sources. To screen and isolate enzyme-containing strains, now with the expansion of databases and the development of bioinformatics tools, it is possible to classify, review and analyze a lot of data related to different enzyme-producing strains. Although, in laboratory studies, a maximum of 20 to 30 strains can be examined. Therefore, when more strains are examined, finally, strains with more stable and efficient enzymes were selected and introduced for laboratory activities. The findings of this study can help researchers to select the appropriate gene source from introduced strains for cloning and expression heterologous inulinase, or to extract native inulinase from introduced strains.																			1618-0240	1618-2863				AUG	2023	23	8								10.1002/elsc.202300003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elsc.202300003		JUL 2023						37533727					WOS:001022131800001

However, it is unclear how vegetation roots affect the soil resistance of gully headwalls to on-wall flow scouring. Materials and methods Taking bare land as the control, this study analysed the vertical distribution of vegetation roots and its influence on the soil properties and antiscourability (ANS) of gully headwalls under three land uses (forestland, grassland, and farmland). Results and discussion The results showed that root mass density (RMD), root length density (RLD), root surface area density (RAD), and root volume density (RVD) decreased overall with increasing soil vertical depth at the gully headwall under the three land use types. The soil ANS ranked highest to lowest in forestland, grassland, farmland, and bare land. Compared with that of bare land, the ANS of each soil layer (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm) under the three land use types increased by 3.0-9.1, 6.7-8.6, 2.6-10.5, 3.9-5.6, and 0.2-1.9 times, respectively. The ANS of the gully headwalls had a logarithmic relationship with RLD, RAD, and RVD (R-2 = 0.45-0.56, P < 0.01). In particular, the most significant correlation was found between the ANS and RVD of fine roots (diameters of 0-0.5 mm). The ANS decreased with the decrease in root density with vertical depth. Conclusions Our results reveal that vertically distributed roots determine the vertical variations in soil ANS on gully headwalls in the gullied Loess Plateau.

Pearl Millet Aquaporin Gene <i>PgPIP2;6</i> Improves Abiotic Stress Tolerance in Transgenic Tobacco	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L) R. Br.] is an important cereal crop of the semiarid tropics, which can withstand prolonged drought and heat stress. Considering an active involvement of the aquaporin (AQP) genes in water transport and desiccation tolerance besides several basic functions, their potential role in abiotic stress tolerance was systematically characterized and functionally validated. A total of 34 AQP genes from P. glaucum were identified and categorized into four subfamilies, viz., plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs), tonoplast intrinsic proteins (TIPs), nodulin-26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs), and small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs). Sequence analysis revealed that PgAQPs have conserved characters of AQP genes with a closer relationship to sorghum. The PgAQPs were expressed differentially under high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and progressive drought stresses where the PgPIP2;6 gene showed significant expression under high VPD and drought stress. Transgenic tobacco plants were developed by heterologous expression of the PgPIP2;6 gene and functionally characterized under different abiotic stresses to further unravel their role. Transgenic tobacco plants in the T-2 generations displayed restricted transpiration and low root exudation rates in low- and high-VPD conditions. Under progressive drought stress, wild-type (WT) plants showed a quick or faster decline of soil moisture than transgenics. While under heat stress, PgPIP2;6 transgenics showed better adaptation to heat (40 degrees C) with high canopy temperature depression (CTD) and low transpiration; under low-temperature stress, they displayed lower transpiration than their non-transgenic counterparts. Cumulatively, lower transpiration rate (Tr), low root exudation rate, declined transpiration, elevated CTD, and lower transpiration indicate that PgPIP2;6 plays a role under abiotic stress tolerance. Since the PgPIP2;6 transgenic plants exhibited better adaptation against major abiotic stresses such as drought, high VPD, heat, and cold stresses by virtue of enhanced transpiration efficiency, it has the potential to engineer abiotic stress tolerance for sustained growth and productivity of crops.

Pasture persistence and enterprise productivity	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE												Sheep production can be optimised by matching the pasture supply curve to feed demand. This study evaluated the production from four management systems with Merino ewes during 2006-2010 in southern New South Wales by using different combinations of lambing time (winter, split, spring), ram breed (Merino, terminal), and percentage of summer-active pasture species (40% or 20% lucerne, Medicago sativa). All systems were stocked at a similar midwinter rate (dry-sheep equivalents per hectare of 8, 10.2, 13, 11.2 and 11.2 in the successive seasons 2006-2010), and there were three replicates of each system. Groundcover and pasture persistence were not adversely impacted by sheep system because sheep were removed at predetermined biomass triggers. Wool production per hectare was up to 178% or 12 kg/ha higher (P < 0.001) in systems where a later month of lambing allowed an increase in number of ewes per hectare at the same midwinter stocking rate. The quantity of lamb sold was not consistently higher in any one system, or in systems producing both crossbred and Merino lambs vs only Merino lambs, owing to variation in the weight and age of lambs at sale, but was increased (P < 0.001) by 175 kg/ha with use of 40% compared with 20% lucerne in a high-rainfall year. The risk of requiring high levels of supplementary feeding was higher in systems with later lambing because of below-average rainfall between 2006 and 2009. Large increases in production can be achieved from the same pasture base through choice of management system with different lambing time, stocking rate or ram breed, but flexibility is needed to optimise production in varying seasonal conditions.					; Friend, Michael/P-1454-2018	Broster, John/0000-0001-5639-9581; Robertson, Susan/0000-0001-5129-2216; Friend, Michael/0000-0001-7750-0570													1836-0939	1836-5787					2020	60	3					388	405		10.1071/AN18555	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN18555													WOS:000508562600007

Agri-waste biochar offers huge potential for carbon abatement in agricultural soils. The present experiment was carried out to compare the effects of residue management, viz., no residue (NR), residue incorporation (RI), and biochar (BC), as well as nitrogen options for emission reduction and carbon capture under the rice-wheat cropping sequence (RWCS) of the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), India. After two cycles of cropping pattern, the analysis revealed that the biochar application (BC) reduces the RWCS's annual CO2 emissions by 18.1 % over residue incorporation (RI), while CH4 and N2O emissions were reduced by 23 % and 20.6 % over RI and 11 % and 29.3 % over no residue (NR), respectively. The application of biochar-based nutrient composites with rice straw biourea (RSBU) at 100 % and 75 % significantly reduced greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) compared to commercial urea at 100 %. The global warming potential of cropping systems recorded with BC was 7 % and 19.3 % lower than NR and RI, respectively, while 6-15 % under RSBU over urea 100 %. The annual carbon footprint (CF) under BC and NR decreased by 37.2 % and 30.8 % over RI, respectively. The net CF under residue burning was estimated to be the highest (132.5 Tg CO2-Ce), followed by RI (55.3 Tg CO2-Ce), showing net positive emissions; however, net negative emissions were found under a biochar-based system. The estimated annual carbon offset potential of a complete biochar system over residue burning, incorporation, and partial biochar as calculated was 189,112, and 92 Tg CO2Ce yr-1, respectively. A biochar-based approach to managing rice straw had great carbon offset potential through a large drop in greenhouse gas emissions and an improved soil carbon pool under the rice wheat system along the IGP, India.

It is important to strengthen research in ESs and social sustainable development to identify the main driving factors of different ESs. This study assessed carbon sequestration (CS), water yield (WY) and soil conservation (SC) from 2000 to 2018 in the Loess Plateau using CASA (The Carnegie-AmesStanford Approach), InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs) and RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) models. The spatial heterogeneity, trade-offs and synergies and driving factors were explored in the whole Loess Plateau. The results showed that the WY, CS and SC had increased from 2000 to 2018. The spatial relationships between WY and SC, SC and CS, and WY and CS were mainly synergistic. Annual mean precipitation (MAP) was the dominant driving factor of WY, while normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and slope (SL) had the strongest explanatory power for CS and SC. The LU was the most critical factor affecting the ESs in the different climatic zones. These results could act as a reference for decision-makers on how to control various influencing factors of ESs to improve the local ecology under local conditions.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Wang, Xiaozhen/0000-0001-7707-6167; Wu, Jianzhao/0000-0003-3124-1109													0301-4797	1095-8630				JUN 1	2022	311								114835	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114835		MAR 2022						35306366					WOS:000777223500005

R.; Liu, Baoyuan			Consolidation effects on relationships among soil erosion properties and soil physical quality indicators	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Consolidation of soil by wetting and drying cycles following tillage rapidly changes the soil physical properties but little is known about how these changes impact soil erosion. The objective of this study was to develop equations to predict soil erodibility (K-d) and critical shear stress (tau(c)) in response to consolidation based upon changes in soil bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, water content, soil penetration strength and surface shear strength following a series of wetting and drying cycles. Air-dried soil from four contrasting soil series was loosely filled into 20 soil cylinders (80 total) to simulate freshly tilled conditions. Soil physical and erosion properties were determined at six time periods (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 days) following daily simulated rainfall of 33 mm h(-1) for 1 h and 24 h of drainage/drying. The Jet Test device was used to determine K-d, and tau(c). The bulk density increased with time due to consolidation following the simulated precipitation events with the largest increase (50-100 % of the total) occurring after the first wetting/drying cycle. The Onstad consolidation model tended to over-predict this initial surface bulk density increase, whereas, an exponential model better represented the surface and depth-averaged bulk density changes for the four soils tested. The shear strength and soil penetration resistance increased dramatically after the first wetting/drying cycle then decreased to a fairly stable value in response to subsequent wetting/drying cycles. The saturated hydraulic conductivity, K-s, decreased so rapidly with accumulated rainfall that an exponential decay model could not match the decrease in K-s as the soil consolidated. The best indicators of erodibility response to consolidation were accumulated rain, surface bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil penetration resistance at the 1.3 cm depth. The best indicators of critical shear stress were accumulated rainfall, soil penetration resistance at 1.3 cm and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Because these erosion parameters had intercepts that were dependent upon the soil series, prediction of changes in soil erosion with time following tillage will be soil-specific.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				APR	2020	198								104550	10.1016/j.still.2019.104550	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.104550													WOS:000515443600030

In this study, a four-year field experiment was conducted on the Loess Plateau of China to investigate the interactive effects of pre-sowing soil water, season, and mulch (FM and bare ground, CK) on winter wheat yield, water use, and WUE. The yield of wheat ranged from 1646 to 7955 kg ha(-1), evapotranspiration (ET) was from 193 and 405 mm, and WUE varied from 8.5 to 19.9 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). In relation to bare ground, plastic mulch increased yield by 19% and WUE by 26%. The interaction between water supply and FM significantly affected ET, but not yield and WUE. Besides conserving more water, increases in yield and WUE under FM were ascribed to the increase in soil temperatures at 10-50 cm soil layers by 0.28-0.53 degrees C, on average, during the wheat-growing period, which promoted root growth, enhanced the use of soil water at deep layers, increased post-anthesis ET, and total ET, especially in average and dry seasons. Biodegradable films are needed to avoid the environmental impact of residual plastic mulch with current materials.					王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023														0378-3774	1873-2283				MAY 31	2022	266								107545	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107545	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107545		FEB 2022											WOS:000793048800003

Water and N use in wheat production in China is relatively inefficient, so a synthesis of data for the effects of water and N inputs on wheat yield, water-use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) is necessary. We conducted a meta-analysis based on 4162 yield, 4158 WUE and 3694 NUE observations from 332 peer-reviewed publications to quantify the effects of water and N inputs on wheat yield, WUE and NUE and to clarify the potentials for saving water and N for wheat production in China. The positive effects of water or N input on all variables decreased when the optimum levels of input were exceeded. Actual yield, WUE and NUE were 29.8, 47.2 and 41.8% significantly lower, respectively, than those potentially attainable. Results differed greatly among regions due to differences in management and climate. The differences between actual and attainable yield, WUE and NUE were highest in the northwestern region and lowest in the north-central region. The difference in WUE was largest in the lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The overall water- and N-saving potentials for wheat production across China were 22.4 and 26.0%, respectively. Yield was highest at a plant density of 180 plants m(-2). The effects of the water and N inputs were more pronounced in areas with silty soil and high levels of soil organic carbon. Yield, WUE and NUE were negatively correlated with mean seasonal temperature, so suitable measures should be taken to control temperatures <15 degrees C. This analysis provides scientific guidance for improving the use efficiencies of resources, reducing environmental pollution, advancing China's food security and improving yield stability.

In this study, we assessed (1) the responses of termite mounds (in terms of their life stages) to changes in geomorphic forms and processes in northeastern Iran; and (2) how extinction of termite mounds encourages a trend of land degradation in semi-arid ecosystems. Samples of soil around active, abandoned, and extinct termite mounds located on young, intermediate, and old alluvial fan surfaces were gathered. Twenty soil physicochemical properties were selected and measured to determine the comparative soil quality indices (SQI). The highest mean SQI value was observed among intermediate fans, where the greatest proportion of active mounds was located. The mean SQI for young and old fans, where the greatest proportion of abandoned mounds was located, displayed a statistically significant decrease. The SQI of areas with extinct mounds exhibited the lowest statistical value. The lower soil quality values for the old and young fans is due to seasonal and annual flooding and associated depositional processes, leading to surface instability on these landforms. The development of gully erosion processes in old fans inhibits soil development and encourages the abandoning of termite mounds. By contrast, the relative stability of the intermediate fan surfaces enables soils to develop, due to the fewer flooding, inundation, and gullying processes, prompting more stability of the termite mounds. These findings describe how environmental changes stimulated by the different geomorphic forms and processes affect the stability trend of termite mounds and lead to changes in their lifecycle stages.					hosseinzadeh, seyed reza/AAC-4069-2022	Mohseni, Neda/0000-0003-0691-9408; Hosseinzadeh, Seyed reza/0000-0002-8653-5473													0341-8162	1872-6887				MAY 15	2023	225								107021	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107021		FEB 2023											WOS:001013277600001

We asked (a) What are the relative effects of variation in environmental, land use (i.e., anthropogenic), and spatial factors on the variation in the species composition of component communities (i.e., in a locality)? and (b) What is the dominant pattern of species associations in infracommunities (in a host individual), and how do these associations vary along environmental and/or anthropogenic gradients? In component communities, the greatest portion of variation in helminth species composition was explained by the combined effects of space, anthropogenic pressure, and NDVI, with the pure effect of the spatial predictor being much stronger than the effects of the remaining predictors. In infracommunities, the probability of occurrence of some, but not all, helminth species depended on the occurrence of another species, with the numbers of negative and positive co-occurrences being equal. The strength and/or sign of associations of some species pairs were spatially stable, whereas interactions between other species pairs varied along the gradient of the amount of green vegetation, from negative to positive and vice versa. We conclude that the processes in parasite infracommunities and component communities in frogs are intertwined, with both bottom-up and top-down effects acting at different hierarchical scales.

Consequently, we determined above-ground vegetation and soil C, N and P concentrations and their stoichiometry in different degradation and recovery stages on the Tibetan Plateau. Four degradation succession stages, GKC: Grass-Kobresia community, KHC: Kobresia humilis community, KPC: Kobresia pygmaea community, and FBC: forbs - black soil beach community, and three recovery succession stages, FG: freely grazed, RG: restricted grazed, and NG: non-grazed, were identified. Above-ground biomass and vegetation coverage decreased with degradation succession and there was a concomitant shift of plant functional groups to more above-ground biomass of forbs and less biomass of grasses and sedges. The highest species diversity emerged in the K. pygmaea succession stage, mainly due to an influx of Compositae. Significant differences in soil total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations occurred in the 0-10 and 10-20 cm layers among degradation successions. Vegetation cover, above-ground biomass, soil TN and SOC, as well as C:N and C:P ratios increased in non-grazed grasslands when compared to grazed grasslands. Soil TN, TP and SOC concentrations decreased with increasing soil depths across all degradation and recovery successions. In addition, soil nutrients and their stoichiometry were affected by above-ground biomass. We concluded that grazing exclusion could improve the above-ground vegetation and soil nutrients of degraded alpine grasslands, but that the rate of recovery was related to the degree of degradation.

Amarender			Agricultural Sustainability and Its Trends in India: A Macro-Level Index-Based Empirical Evaluation	SUSTAINABILITY												Sustainable development warrants cognizance of the limits of the ecosystem in terms of carrying capacity and technological externalities and, therefore, the limited extent of substitutability of natural capital with physical capital. The notion of sustainability assumes maximization and/or maintenance of current production without increasing the per unit use of inputs. In this paper, we assess the agricultural sustainability of 17 Indian states using an indicator approach for a period of two decades (1991-2011). For the analysis, the paper primarily uses the normalized temporal data for construction of indices for each of the selected indicators grouped under environmental, economic, and social dimensions. Overall, the agricultural sustainability has improved in all the states. Among the sub-components, while the social-sustainability dimension improved in all the states, the environmental and economic dimensions improved in 8 and 14 states, respectively. There was significant variation in sustainability performance among the states. Economic and environmental sustainability indices were negatively correlated. Based on the results, we advocate a strategy that negates this negative correlation. We recommend a comprehensive approach for integrating all the three dimensions for planning actions towards sustainable agricultural growth.

In this study, ion content was determined by ion chromatography and atomic absorption spectrophotometer, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomic analysis was carried out. Then metabolic pathways were constructed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and the MetaboAnalyst website to compare the changes and differences of young and old leaves of two wild soybean lines with different stress tolerance under low-phosphorus (LP) stress. The aim was to reveal the mechanism of wild soybean resistance to LP stress from insights concerning nutrient accumulation and mobilization. The results showed that in LP-tolerant wild soybean, Ca2+ accumulated and TCA, amino acid and organic acid metabolisms were enhanced in young and old leaves; disaccharide and trisaccharide metabolism was enhanced and phosphohexose metabolism was inhibited in old leaves; Mg2+, disaccharide and trisaccharide contents increased in young leaves, while inorganic P was relatively stable. Our experiment highlighted that LP-tolerant wild soybean adapted to LP stress by enhancing energy and material metabolisms and maintaining the growth and development of young leaves at the expense of old leaves, which is of great significance for the development and utilization of germplasm resources and the breeding of LP-tolerant soybean.																			0167-6903	1573-5087				MAY	2022	97	1					21	31		10.1007/s10725-022-00804-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-022-00804-1		FEB 2022											WOS:000753466000001

To address this issue, we investigated the effects of dual plastic film and straw mulching in ridge-furrow(RF) system on wheat productivity, soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in a semiarid area in Kenya from 2015 to 2017. The experimental site represents a typical semiarid continental monsoon climate, and soil type is chromic vertisols. Field experiment with randomized block design consisted of six RF treatments as follows: 1) dual black plastic film and straw mulching (RFbS), 2) dual transparent plastic film and straw mulching (RFtS), 3) sole black plastic film mulching (RFb), 4) sole transparent plastic mulching RF (RFt), 5) sole straw mulching (RFS) and 6) no mulching (CK). The results indicated that seasonal dynamics of rainfall and air temperature fit in with the weather type of El Nino over four growing seasons. RFbS, RFtS, RFb and RFt significantly increased soil water storage (SWS), topsoil temperature, aboveground biomass, grain yield and water use efficiency across four growing seasons (p < 0.05) as compared with CK. Among all the treatments, RFbS and RFtS achieved the greatest SWS, AgB, grain yield and WUE, owing to improved soil hydrothermal status in both treatments. Critically, RFbS and RFtS significantly improved soil organic carbon and total nitrogen, soil bulk density and the C:N ratio following four growing seasons, comparing with other treatments (p < 0.05). Besides, RFbS and RFtS gave the highest economic returns among all treatments. For the first time, we found that dual plastic film and straw mulching could serve as a sustainable land management to boost wheat productivity and improve soil quality under El Nino in semiarid areas of SSA.

Soil phosphorus deficiency is one of the common factors causing soil barrenness. Plants have evolved morphological, physiological and molecular ad-aptations to resist to phosphorus deficiency. Wild soybean, a wild relative of cultivated soybean, has an obvious genetic relationship with cultivated soybean and has many beneficial characteristics such as strong low phos-phorus resistance. Therefore, in this study, the integration analysis of transcriptome and metabolome of wild and cultivated soybean seedlings leaves were applied under phosphorus deficiency to reveal the mechanism of resistance to low phosphorus stress in wild soybean leaves, especially the key role of membrane phospholipid reuse and protection. Under phosphorus deficiency, wild soybean resisted low phosphorus stress by enhancing phosphorus reuse and strengthening membrane protection mechanisms, that is, by enhancing phospholipid metabolism, degrading membrane phospholipids, releasing phosphorus, increasing phosphorus reuse, and enhancing galactolipid biosynthesis. This, in turn, produced digalactosyl diacylglycerol to replace missing phospholipids for membrane maintenance and enhanced glutathione metabolism to protect the membrane system from damage. At the same time, phosphorus deficiency increased the levels of the intermediate metab-olites glycine and ornithine, while significantly regulating the expression of transcription factors WRKY75 and MYB86. The enhancement of these metabolic pathways and the significant regulation of gene expression play an important role in improving the low phosphorus tolerance of wild soybean. This study will provide a useful theoretical basis for breeding soybean with low phosphorus tolerance.																			0981-9428	1873-2690				JAN 1	2023	194						406	417		10.1016/j.plaphy.2022.11.038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2022.11.038		DEC 2022						36493589					WOS:000895751400002

So far, transcriptomic approach was not used in peanut for performing trait mapping in bi-parental populations. In this research, we sequenced the whole transcriptome in immature seeds in a peanut recombinant inbred line (RIL) population and explored thoroughly the landscape of transcriptomic variations and its genetic basis. The comprehensive analysis identified total 49 691 genes in RIL population, of which 92 genes followed a paramutation-like expression pattern. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis identified 1207 local eQTLs and 15 837 distant eQTLs contributing to the whole-genome transcriptomic variation in peanut. There were 94 eQTL hot spot regions detected across the genome with the dominance of distant eQTL. By integrating transcriptomic profile and annotation analyses, we unveiled a putative candidate gene and developed a linked marker InDel02 underlying a major QTL responsible for purple testa colour in peanut. Our result provided a first understanding of genetic basis of whole-genome transcriptomic variation in peanut and illustrates the potential of the transcriptome-aid approach in dissecting important traits in non-model plants.

ECOHYDROLOGY												Long-term field campaigns in the Negev observed wet-dry cycles (WDCs) following rain events, principally on sand. Aiming to assess the relevant mechanism (whether dewfall, water capillarity or distillation derived by temperature-induced vapor flux [TIVF] which stems from the soil), a set of outdoor experiments was conducted on sand and loess. They included nonrainfall water (NRW) and temperature measurements during the rainless dry seasons (summer, fall) and during the winter, which was divided to a wet (following rain) and dry periods. Dew measurements were conducted on cloths, whether directly attached to the soil or located at 0.5 cm above ground, aiming to eliminate capillarity and assessing the possible contribution of dewfall and TIVF-induced distillation. Our findings show that (a) WDCs were only observed following rainstorms, particularly on sand, (b) WDCs could not have been explained by capillarity (they continued at the presence of an air gap), (c) significantly lower minimum surface temperatures (averaging 0.8 degrees C) characterized the sand, which following rainstorms resulted in higher NRW due to TIVF, that is, visibly noted WDCs. With sand being characterized by a lush cover of biocrusts in the Negev dunefields, while being largely absent from the loessial playas scattered within the dunefield, it is suggested that WDCs may play an important role in the establishment and growth of biocrusts over sand dunes of the Negev and possibly in other arid dunes.

Impact of different irrigation regimes under varied planting density on growth, yield and economic return of cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.)	IRRIGATION SCIENCE												To assess the effect of planting density and irrigation in cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) during its critical growth stages such as flowering and fruit set on, growth, yield, water-use efficiency and farm income, a field experiment was initiated in a split-plot design in 2011at Puttur, Karnataka, India. The main plot consisted of three planting densities namely, 5x4m, 6x4m and 10x5m. The irrigation treatments were imposed in subplots as, irrigation at 60% cumulative pan evaporation (CPE), at 40% CPE, at 20% CPE, irrigation once in 15 days, soil and water conservation technique, and control (without any irrigation or soil water conservation technique). The results indicated that the growth, raw cashew nut yield and net income during 5th and 6th year of plantation of cashew increased with increase in planting density per unit area. The average increase in nut yield under high density planting ranged from 75 to 81% compared to normal density planting. Irrigation using drip system from December to March at 20% CPE and 40% CPE was beneficial to increase the nut yield by 53.5% and 34.1% compared to control. The yield increase under soil and water conservation practice was 12.9%, and 59.7% under irrigation once in 15days. The increased planting density was beneficial to increase the net income and benefit-cost ratio. The deficit irrigation practices were useful to increase the water-use efficiency in cashew. Widely spaced trees showed increased water-use efficiency compared to high-density planting. Overall, the study demonstrated the usefulness of increased planting density and appropriate irrigation practices to increase yield and net income from cashew orchards.

However, the extent to which the various inoculated Rhz strains, P application, and combined application of Rhz + P studies contribute to improving yield, performed on a comprehensive analysis approach, and profit farmers are yet to be understood. This study reviewed different experimental studies conducted on soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.] Walp), and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea [L.]) to which Rhz inoculants, P supplements, or Rhz + P combination were applied to improve the yield in Ghana. Multiple-step search combinations of published articles and multivariate analysis computing approaches were used to assess the effects of Rhz inoculation, P application, or both application of Rhz and P on yield variation. The random forest (RF) regression model was further employed to quantify the relative importance of various predictor variables on yield. The meta-analysis results showed that cowpea exhibited the highest (61.7%) and groundnut (19.8%) the lowest average yield change. The RF regression model revealed that the combined application of Rhz and P fertilizer (10.5%) and Rhz inoculation alone (7.8%) were the highest explanatory variables to predict yield variation in soybean. The Rhz + P combination, Rhz inoculation, and genotype wang-Kae explained 11.6, 10.02, and 8.04% of yield variability for cowpea, respectively. The yield in the inoculated plants increased by 1.48-, 1.26-, and 1.16-fold when compared to that in the non-inoculated cowpea plants following inoculation with BR 3299, KNUST 1002, and KNUST 1006 strains, respectively. KNUST 1006 strain exhibited the highest yield increase ratio (1.3-fold) in groundnut plants. Inoculants formulation with a viable concentration of 10(9) cells g(-1) and a minimum inoculum rate of 1.0 x 10(6) cells seed(-1) achieved the highest average yield change for soybean but not for cowpea and groundnut. The meta-analysis calls for prospective studies to investigate the minimum rate of bacterial cells required for optimum inoculation responses in cowpea and groundnut.

These changes substantially influence the intensity of evapotranspiration (ET), thereby regulating the local microclimate. In this study, we estimated ET based on the Penman-Monteith (PM) method and Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model and quantitatively estimated the mass of water vapor and heat absorption on the LP. We analyzed the regulatory effect of vegetation restoration on local microclimate from 2000 to 2015 and found the following: (1) Both the leaf area index (LAI) value and actual ET increased significantly across the region during the study period, and there was a significant positive correlation between them in spatial patterns and temporal trends. (2) Vegetation regulated the local microclimate through ET, which increased the absolute humidity by 2.76-3.29 g m(-3), increased the relative humidity by 15.43%-19.31% and reduced the temperature by 5.38-6.43 degrees C per day from June to September. (3) The cooling and humidifying effects of vegetation were also affected by the temperature on the LP. (4) Correlation analysis showed that LAI was significantly correlated with temperature at the monthly scale, and the response of vegetation growth to temperature had no time-lag effect. This paper presents new insights into quantitatively assessing the regulatory effect of vegetation on the local microclimate through ET and helps to objectively evaluate the ecological effects of the Grain for Green Project on the LP.					li, xiao/HKV-8405-2023; li, xiao/HJP-5134-2023; wang, chenxi/HMD-9902-2023; Li, xiaofei/GXF-7187-2022; Jin, Zhao/HPH-6692-2023; LI, XIAO/IQV-9318-2023														1009-637X	1861-9568				FEB	2022	32	2					291	316		10.1007/s11442-022-1948-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-022-1948-y													WOS:000749207800007

Understanding the differences in different maize cultivars' responses to S. frugiperda infestation is very important for revealing the mechanisms involved in the resistance of maize plants to S. frugiperda. In this study, a comparative analysis of two maize cultivars, the common cultivar 'ZD958' and the sweet cultivar 'JG218', was used to investigate their physico-biochemical responses to S. frugiperda infestation by a pot experiment. The results showed that the enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense responses of maize seedlings were rapidly induced by S. frugiperda. Frist, the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents of infested maize leaves were significantly increased and then decreased to the level of the control. Furthermore, compared with the control leaves, the puncture force values and the total phenolics, total flavonoids, and 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one contents of infested leaves were significantly increased within a certain time. The superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities of infested leaves were significantly increased in a certain period of time, while the catalase activities decreased significantly and then increased to the control level. The jasmonic acid (JA) levels of infested leaves were significantly improved, whereas the salicylic acid and abscisic acid levels changed less. Signaling genes associated with phytohormones and defensive substances including PAL4, CHS6, BX12, LOX1, and NCED9 were significantly induced at certain time points, especially LOX1. Most of these parameters changed greater in JG218 than in ZD958. Moreover, the larvae bioassay showed that S. frugiperda larvae weighed more on JG218 leaves than those on ZD958 leaves. These results suggested that JG218 was more susceptible to S. frugiperda than ZD958. Our findings will make it easier to develop strategies for controlling S. frugiperda for sustainable maize production and breeding of new maize cultivars with increased resistance to herbivores.																			1664-462X					FEB 10	2023	14								1065891	10.3389/fpls.2023.1065891	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1065891								36844097					WOS:000937447400001

However, since no single technology has been found to be effective againstStriga,integrated management is needed to achieve satisfactory and sustainableStrigacontrol. Both on-station and on-farm trials were undertaken from 2013 to 2015 in Bauchi and Kano States of Nigeria to evaluate the performance of integratedStrigacontrol technologies. In the on-station trials, a soybean-maize rotation did not suppressStrigain maize in either location. However, nitrogen application suppressed and reducedStrigainfection, except in Bauchi in 2014. The soybean-maize rotation accompanied by N application reducedStrigadamage in both locations. On farmers' fields, rotating soybean with maize significantly reducedStrigainfection. At the same time, the use of maize varieties with a combined tolerance to drought and resistance toStrigaparasitism also increased maize grain yield on farmers' fields, probably due to three factors: a reduction inStrigainfection, reduced effects of a mid-season moisture deficit, and increased uptake of nutrients from the soil. We concluded that the use ofStriga-resistant maize varieties in combination with the application of N fertilizer and rotation with soybean could increase the productivity of maize inStriga-infested fields in the Nigerian savannas.

Evaluating temperature thresholds and optimizing sowing dates of wheat in Bihar	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY												Studies on wheat-weather relationship were carried out at Pusa (25.98 degrees N, 85.67 degrees E, 52 m), Bihar situated in middle Gangetic plains of India, with three popular wheat cultivars viz. RW 3711, HD 2824 and HD273, grown under five fixed dates of sowing viz. 15 November, 25 November, 5 December, 15 December and 25 December, for five consecutive rabi seasons from 2011-12 to 2015-16. Thresholds of maximum temperature (T-max), minimum temperature (T-min) and bright sunshine hours (BSH), associated with higher productivity, occurring at different phenophases, were determined. Results revealed that temperature played a crucial role in achieving higher grain yield of wheat. Both T-max and T-min during flowering to milking and flowering to maturity phases increased with delayed sowing dates beyond 25 November with consequent reductions in grain yield. During 50 % flowering to milk stage, T-max and T-min above 24.6 degrees C and 11.6 degrees C, respectively, reduced grain yield below 4000 kg ha(-1); significant reduction in grain yield was also noted beyond maximum temperature of 26.9 degrees C. During flowering to milk and flowering to maturity phases, T-max and T-min exhibited highly significant negative correlation with grain yield, indicating higher temperatures causing lower grain yield. With delayed sowing, sensitive phases of the crop experienced higher air temperatures which led to reduction in grain yield. An increase of T(max )from 29.2 to 32.1 degrees C during flowering to maturity phases reduced the wheat productivity drastically in this region of Indo-Gangetic plains. Grain yield declined by 399 kg ha(-1) per 1 degrees C rise in T-max during 50 % flowering to maturity stage. Considering grain yield vis-a-vis temperature regimes during flowering to maturity stage, the most important recommendation for the farmers of the region would be to finish wheat sowing before 25 November in order to enable them to escape terminal heat stress in wheat and thereby realizing higher grain yield. The anthesis-time management by manipulating sowing dates could be a realistic adaptation strategy for attaining optimum grain yield under changing climate scenario.																			0972-1665					JUN	2020	22	2					158	164																WOS:000595369100008

The goal of this study was to quantify T and E using eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements in a tallgrass prairie in consecutive growing seasons with contrasting rainfall regimes. The field measurements were conducted at the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) KONZ site, in Kansas, U.S., during the growing seasons of 2017, 2018 and 2019. The ET partitioning was performed using an approach based on the concept of the underlying water use efficiency (uWUE). To evaluate the uWUE approach, we compared daily E estimates obtained from the uWUE with E observations provided by microlysimeters (ML). Green chromatic coordinate (GCC) was used to monitor the vegetation dynamics. In the 2017 growing season, the total rainfall was 23.1% below the site's long-term average cumulative precipitation. On the other hand, in 2018 and 2019 the accumulated growing season precipitations were 7.2% and 40.2%, respectively, above the long-term precipitation average. The relationship between uWUE approach and ML E measurements showed a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.42 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.58 mm d(-1). The lowest T/ET average value (0.50) was observed in the 2017 growing season, while the largest T/ET average (0.65) was observed in 2018. The correlations between GCC and T/ET were reduced during the growing seasons that experienced drought periods. Air temperature was the main environmental driver of T/ET during the wet growing seasons (r = 0.49 and 0.72). The subsurface soil moisture (0.45 m) was the main environmental driver of T/ET during a dry growing season (r = 0.41). These results demonstrate that the precipitation variability not only has a direct impact on the ET components but also modulates the response of those components to other environmental drivers. Since ET partitioning studies at the ecosystem scale are still scarce, our results can improve T/ET and water use efficiency estimates in long-term modelling studies. This will help to better understand how ET in ecosystems will respond to global warming and increased CO2 concentration during wet and dry growing seasons.

Ensuring that the nutrient content of crops is adequate is important in addition to obtaining a high yield in the current agricultural production in China. Thus, a field experiment with two typical mulch planting methods (full plastic film mulching, RFF; half plastic film mulching, RFH) and five fertilization rates (N 0 +P2O5 0 kg ha(-1); N 117 +P2O5 59 kg ha(-1); N 173 +P2O5 87 kg ha(-1) N 229 +P2O5 115 kg ha(-1); N 285 +P2O5 143 kg ha(-1)) was conducted from 2014 to 2016 in a semiarid region, China. The potential effects of film mulching on maize nutritional quality and the differences under different fertilizer rates were studied. The results showed that RFF improved soil water and temperature conditions, and significantly increased the maize grain yield (by 17.2-38.0%) and nutrients uptake (by 14.0-22.3% in nitrogen, 24.8-35.2% in phosphorus) compared with RFH. However, the nutrient contents of plant organs decreased to different extents under RFF compared with RFH, indicating a "dilution effect". In particular, the grain nutrient content decreased by up to 3.6% for nitrogen and 6.5% for phosphorus with fertilization up to N 160 +P2O5 80 kg ha(-1), but with an increasing tendency above this rate. In addition, fertilization significantly increased the maize grain yield and nutrient content, but both did not increase significantly above N230 + P(2)O(5)115 kg ha(-1), and the NUE gradually decreased, especially nitrogen under RFF. Thus, RFF significantly improved the maize yield and nutrients uptake compared with RFH, but there was a risk of nutritional quality degradation, and surprisingly, this effect can be adjusted or even avoided by changing the amount of fertilizer applied. For example, in the study region, both the maize yield and quality of RFF were improved compared with RFH in the fertilization range of N(160-230)+P2O5(80-115) kg ha(-1).																			0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 1	2021	257								107133	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107133		AUG 2021											WOS:000703159300005
J	Fan, JL; McConkey, BG; St Luce, M; Brandt, K				Fan, Jianling; McConkey, Brian G.; Luce, Mervin St.; Brandt, Kelsey			Rotational benefit of pulse crop with no-till increase over time in a semiarid climate	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Water deficit is the major constraint to crop production in dry temperate climates and no-till (NT) has been widely recommended to increase water conservation, crop yields, and soil organic carbon (SOC) content. In this study, tillage practice [conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT), NT and annually alternating tillage with NT (NT/MT)]] and crop rotation [fallow-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; FW), continuous wheat (CW), and wheat-pulse (WP) rotation] effects were investigated in a long-term experiment over three decades. Although NT increased soil water conservation and water use efficiency (WUE) compared to CT and MT, wheat yields were not higher for NT during the first 13 years when nitrogen (N) fertilizer was broadcast in the soil. After 1996, when N fertilizer was side-banded during seeding, CW-NT had 6% higher yields than CW-MT although not significant. The mean yield of pulse crops was 14 % higher for NT than MT, where the greatest yield benefit was found in warmer and drier years so NT is also adaptation to weather variability. The yield advantage of wheat after pulse in WP compared to CW increased by 41 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (P < 0.001), indicating that the benefits of pulse crop on wheat production increases with time. Annual grain N uptake was greater in WP than CW or FW and greater for NT than MT for WP. The biennial tillage in CW-NT/MT benefitted the wheat yield in the following NT year so that it was greater than those of both CW-MT and CW-NT in those years. The rankings of SOC stock to 15 cm or 30 cm were generally the same as to 7.5 cm but differences were only significant to 15 cm in some samplings and only a trend (P < 0.10) was detected to 30 cm after 29 years. Unexpectedly, the CW-NT/MT had the highest SOC stocks and such regular periodic tillage warrants further investigation. The pulse-wheat rotation under NT was the best cropping system for achieving a combination of efficient use of fertilizer N and high annual crop yield and quality, for which the benefit of pulse in rotation increases over time.

J	Wang, HD; She, DL; Sun, XQ; Tang, SQ; Zheng, YP				Wang Hongde; She Dongli; Sun Xiaoqin; Tang Shengqiang; Zheng Yipeng			Analysis of unsaturated shear strength and slope stability considering soil desalinization in a reclamation area in China	CATENA												The unsaturated soil shear strength is a crucial parameter for the evaluation of erosion and slope stability analysis. In this study, we collected unsaturated and undisturbed soil samples in Aug 2018 and investigated the relationship between the unsaturated soil shear strength, soil salt content (SSC) and particle content in coastal reclamation areas. A combination method of the direct shear test and soil water characteristic curve (SWCC) was used on undisturbed soil to determine the unsaturated soil shear strength in 79 soil sampling sites. The shear strengths of four gradient salt content soils with different matric suctions were selected to perform a slope stability analysis using the strength reduction method (SRM) for an agricultural engineering slope model considering soil desalinization. The shear strength of unsaturated soils increased with increasing matric suction, especially when the soil salt content was high. The soil effective cohesion was found to be significantly positively correlated with the SSC and clay content, while the soil effective internal friction angle was significantly negatively correlated with the SSC and clay content. The internal friction angle related to matric suction was independent of the soil properties. The location of the critical failure surface was deeper, and the factor of safety (FS) was higher on a slope with a high SSC at all slope gradients than that with a low SCC. The FS decreased with increasing saturation and decreasing SSC. This implies that the agricultural engineering slope, especially for drainage ditch slopes rammed with high salt content soils, was at the stable stage after its establishment but had higher potential to fail during desalinization and saturation. This study aims to evaluate slope stability using unsaturated soil shear strength and increase the current understanding of the soil desalinization of saline-sodic soils and their efficacy in soil shear strength in coastal reclamation areas.

Inventory of on-farm sorghum landrace diversity and climate adaptation in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia: implications for sorghum breeding and conservation	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION												The study was conducted with the aim of inventorying and assessing the level of sorghum landraces richness, estimating the extent and patterns of phenotypic diversity, identifying race type, and predicting suitable areas of production using future climate scenarios in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Overall, 358 landraces from 125 independent farmers' fields in 20 districts belonging to four zones of Tigray were surveyed. Landraces richness, frequency of character states, and diversity levels were estimated via Margalef's, Menhinick's and Shannon-Weaver (H ') indices for each zone and altitude classes. Suitable areas for sorghum cultivation in the future were predicted using DIVA-GIS. Altogether, 140 distinctly named landraces were identified and collected. Southern zone has the highest richness (D-Mg = 10.74, D-Mn = 5.0) followed by central (D-Mg = 8.54, D-Mn = 3.80). The estimated H ' for the phenotypic character states ranged from 0.24 (seed form) to 0.95 (rachis branch length). Highest diversity estimate was found in northwest (H ' = 0.71) followed by central zone (H ' = 0.64). Respectively, H ' was 0.70, 0.68, and 0.61 in lowland, intermediate, and highland elevations. In general, lowlands of northwest, central, and southern zones are identified as potential sites for germplasm conservation and utilization. The races durra, bicolor, caudatum, and durra-bicolor were found with durra as the dominant race (79%). All the currently surveyed areas and many other sites in Tigray are predicted to be suitable for future sorghum production under the changing climate scenario. Copies of all the 358 sorghum landraces are deposited in the national gene bank for use in future sorghum breeding work. The wealth of sorghum landraces diversity could be used in sorghum improvement programs.

In the present study, we conducted a long-term wheat rotation experiment in Zhenyuan County, Gansu Province, China, between 2005 and 2017, where three cropping systems were tested: (1) continuous winter wheat cropping (W), (2) wheat-wheat-wheat-soybean, i.e., 3 years of wheat and 1 year of soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation (W3-S), and (3) wheat-wheat-wheat-maize, i.e., 3 years of wheat and 1 year of maize (Zea mays L.) rotation (W3-M). Equal amounts of fertilizer were applied to all treatments. All treatments were conducted for four years and repeated three times, with a total of 12 years. Continuous wheat cropping increased the soil bulk density and decreased the soil porosity compared with 2005. However, W3-S and W3-M significantly reduced the soil bulk density and increased the soil nutrients and enzyme activities in 2017 compared with continuous wheat cropping. The average increases in the soil water storage under W3-S and W3-M were 12.7% and 5.9%, respectively. During the wheat growing season, the water use efficiencies under W3-S and W3-M were 22.9% and 12.9% higher, respectively, than that under continuous wheat cropping. The average wheat yields under W3-S and W3-M increased by 25.1% and 14.1%, respectively. Furthermore, according to principal component analysis and correlation analysis, the yield increases were due to the enhanced soil quality, enzyme activities, and water use efficiency. These results suggest that rotation can enhance the soil properties, soil enzyme activity, crop yield, and soil water use efficiency. In addition, wheat-soybean rotation had more positive effects than wheat-maize rotation on the soil quality and crop productivity in the study area. However, wheat was not produced in the fourth year of rotation so the replacement crop would need to be economically viable to facilitate widespread adoption. Further investigation is also required to determine whether the lower biomass production associated with legumes was offset by the increased soil organic carbon during the wheat phase of the rotation. The best rotation method identified in this study may provide a cleaner agronomic production strategy.					wang, shuying/HHZ-4516-2022; Li, Shangzhong/HHD-1335-2022	Wu, Peng/0000-0002-8549-9992; Ahmad, Dr. Shakeel/0000-0001-8232-3396; FU, LIU/0000-0003-1980-9996													0959-6526	1879-1786				DEC 20	2021	329								129768	10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129768	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129768		NOV 2021											WOS:000730127900002

In this study, we identified 22 basic leucine zipper transcription factors (bZIP TFs) that responded to two concentrations (1 and 50 mu M) of indole-acetic acid (IAA) during wheat root development by transcriptome analysis. In addition, we identified 176 TabZIP genes from the wheat genome. Phylogenetic classification and gene structure analysis indicated that the 22 auxin-responsive TabZIPs were divided into groups 1 to 9 (except group 3) with different functions. Phenotypic analysis showed that knocking out Arabidopsis AtHY5, which is the homologous gene of TabZIP6D_147 (one of the downregulated auxin-responsive TabZIPs under both 1 and 50 mu M IAA that belonged to group 4), resulted in insensitivity to IAA, while the phenotype of TabZIP6D_147/hy5 complementary lines recovered to that of the wild type, suggesting that downregulated TabZIP6D_147 plays a negative role in the auxin signalling pathway. These results revealed that auxin-responsive TabZIP genes may play different roles in root architecture in the response to the two concentrations of auxin.

Because of the limitations of in-situ observations, only a few studies have analyzed the dynamics of snow cover across the whole of China. In this study, we studied the spatio-temporal variabilities of snow cover over China and explored the covary of snow cover with precipitation and temperature in spring and winter based on the surface snow cover observations of 201 meteorological stations in China during 1960-2013. The temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the mean daily snow depth and the number of snow cover days were analyzed. Results showed snow depth and the number of snow-cover days were high in Northeast China, Eastern China-Inner Mongolia, Northern Xinjiang, Southeastern and South Region of the Tibetan Plateau. The trend of snow depth and the number of snow-cover days varied among different regions. Snow depth recorded at 34.3% of the stations showed an increasing trend during the study period. There were increasing trends of the snow-cover days at 40.8% of stations. Increasing trends of the mean annual daily snow depth and the number of snowcover days were statistically insignificant (p > 0.05) while an abrupt change of the number of snow cover days was found in 1975. Change points of the mean daily snow depth in autumn and winter occurred in 1987 and 2008, respectively. Change points of the number of snow-cover days in spring and winter occurred in 2009 and 1983, respectively. Snow cover in China covaried with various climate factors, i.e., precipitation or temperature. This study improved our knowledge on snow cover changes and is beneficial for further studies on climate change in China.

Spatial analysis, sources, and categories of e-waste clusters in developing countries: kano metropolis case study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Electronic waste, also known as e-waste, is any part or entire electrical or electronic product that has reached the end of its useful life. In recent years, e-waste has emerged as an issue of increasing concern as its sources, categories, collection, and treatment can lead to significant environmental damage. Moreover, there are inadequate studies about how e-waste is collected, classified, distributed, treated, and disposed of in developing countries. The objective of this study is to examine the spatial analysis of e-waste clusters (collection and treatment points), sources, and categories in Kano metropolis, Nigeria. We conducted focus group discussions (FGD) at the e-waste collection centres to estimate the number of extractors at each site. KoBo Collect Tool Box was used to generate the inventory of the e-waste collection and treatment points, while ArcGIS 10.4 was used to map the spatial distribution of the e-waste collection and treatment points and perform locational analysis. The findings revealed that repairers, scavengers, companies, institutions, and households are the major sources of e-waste in Kano metropolis. A significant portion of the e-waste collected consists of lamps, screens, small equipment, temperature exchange equipment, and information and communications devices. In Kano, however, there are few e-waste collection and treatment sites. Among the key e-waste collection sites are Kurmi and Sabon Gari Markets, while Kuka Bulukiya and PRP Gidan Ruwa serve as treatment hotspots in Kano metropolis. In spite of this, the distribution of e-waste collection points and treatment facilities is highly random due to their distance from one another.

Long-term subsoiling and straw return increase soil organic carbon fractions and crop yield	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Conservation tillage has been adopted worldwide as an attractive alternative to conventional tillage. However, suitable conservation tillage for increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) and crop yield simultaneously is still limited. Two conservation tillage methods, sub -soiling to the 40 cm depth (ST) and no-tillage (NT), were combined with three straw return treatments (i.e., no return [-0], return of whole wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw and 1 m high maize (Zea mays L.) stubble [-1], and return of whole wheat and maize straw [-a]) to study their impacts on SOC content, labile C fractions, and crop yields, with conventional tillage (CT) used as a control in a 15-year field experiment. Subsoiling with 1 m high maize stubble return (ST-1) increased the mean annual grain yields by 18% and the mean SOC content by 39% at the 0 to 100 cm depth compared with conventional tillage with no maize straw return (CT-0) in 2016 and 2017. The mean SOC at the 0 to 100 cm depth of the NT treatment was lower than those of ST and CT because of the reduced transformation from straw to SOC and labile C fractions. One meter high maize stubble return can maintain high SOC content, C fractions, and crop yield compared with whole maize straw return. Thus, subsoiling combined with 1 m high maize stubble return was an effective conservation tillage to increase the SOC content and crop yield.

The Effect of Elevated Temperature on Salt Tolerance Mechanism in C<sub>4</sub> Xero-Halophyte <i>Kochia prostrata</i>	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY												The study of effect of elevated temperature on the mechanisms of salt tolerance in plants are of great interest and perspective under global climate change. This study investigated the individual and combined effects of prolonged heat and four days moderate salinity on morphophysiological and biochemical parameters (biomass, photosystems I and II (F-v/F-m) efficiencies, apparent photosynthesis intensity, transpiration, dark respiration, water-use efficiency, contents of water, free proline, Na+ and K+ in aboveground parts of plants) in the C-4 xero-halophyte Kochia prostrata. The physiological processes and biochemical parameters actively involved during acclimation to stress under different treatments (control, heat, salinity, heat + salinity) were identified. A decrease in biomass and change in the K+/Na+ ratio was observed under all treatments. Acclimation to heat resulted in increased dark respiration intensity (Rd) and K+ content. Under salinity conditions, an increase in Na+ content, a decrease in PSI efficiency and transpiration intensity were observed. Combined stress (heat + salinity) resulted in increased proline and Na+ contents in addition to high values of Rd and K+. Principal component analysis showed that under combined stress, dark respiration, K+ and proline are actively involved in acclimation. It was found that acclimation to elevated temperature affects the salt tolerance mechanisms in K. prostrata, since under combined stress, sodium ions accumulated 3-fold less than in plants under normal temperature and salinity. It is assumed that in K. prostrata plants grown at elevated temperature, K+ and proline are more involved in the acclimation to salinity than Na+. Dark respiration is likely the source of additional energy costs. We conclude that acclimation of C-4 halophytes to elevated temperature changes the importance of sodium and potassium ions, as well as proline, in the mechanisms of salt tolerance.					, Z.Rakhmankulova/AAN-1058-2021	Voronin, Pavel/0000-0002-2239-2506													1021-4437	1608-3407				DEC	2022	69	6							137	10.1134/S1021443722060322	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1021443722060322													WOS:000885058300008

Three typical heavy metals (zinc, cadmium, and lead) were selected as the model ions, and two types of MMT (Arizona and Wyoming) were considered. The results showed that Cd2+ and Pb2+ can form both inner- and outer-sphere complexes on Wyoming MMT, while Zn2+ only formed outer-sphere complex due to the stronger hydration interaction of Zn2+ than Cd2+ and Pb2+. For Arizona MMT, all of the three ions only formed outer-sphere complexes on its interlayer and external basal surface in which the cations remained a fully hydrated state. The calculated diffusion coefficients of three cations in interlayer and nanopore indicated that their diffusion abilities were significantly impaired, implying that MMT adsorbents have a strong ability to fix and retard heavy metal ions. The derived results and mechanisms are instrumental to a profound understanding of the transport and retention of heavy metal elements in subsurface environments, and provide guidance for the management of heavy metal pollution.

J	Wang, HD; She, DL; Fei, YH; Tang, SQ				Wang, Hongde; She, Dongli; Fei, Yuanhang; Tang, Shengqiang			Synergic effects of biochar and polyacrylamide amendments on the mechanical properties of silt loam soil under coastal reclamation in China	CATENA												Recent surveys have reported severe erosion and slope collapse caused by a combination of the poor structure of silt loam and heavy rainfall in reclaimed areas of China. Biochar and polyacrylamide (PAM) have been widely used as amendments to protect soil from degradation and enhance plant growth. However, few studies have focused on their synergic effects on soil mechanical properties. In this study, biochar and PAM were incorporated into silt loam at rates of 0%, 2%, and 5% and 0 parts per thousand, 0.4 parts per thousand, and 1 parts per thousand, respectively, to investigate the extent to which biochar and PAM additions affect soil consistency limits and shear strength and to evaluate the slope reliability under natural conditions. The results show that the plastic limit (PL) and liquid limit (LL) were significantly enhanced by amendments of 5% biochar and 1 parts per thousand PAM. Soil consistency limits were significantly correlated with the soil 3D fractal dimension (FD), mu-CT porosity and electrical conductivity (EC). Amendment of coastal silt loam soil with biochar resulted in decreased cohesion. The application of PAM reduced the negative effect of biochar on cohesion and considerably increased the cohesion value of the silt loam. The results of the slope stability analysis were closely related to the shear strength parameters. Biochar-amended silt loam soil in the coastal area exhibited a much lower factor of safety (FS) compared with the control soil, irrespective of the level of the water and the slope angle within the slope system. A PAM amendment in coastal silt loam soil increased the FS significantly (P < 0.05) and minimized the negative effects on the FS that was caused by the biochar amendment. Therefore, biochar and PAM could be applied to silt loam soil together to improve soil quality to enhance the slope stability under coastal reclamation in China.

Therefore, understanding the relationship between root traits and environmental factors is essential for improving N and water acquisition. A field experiment was conducted in the semi-arid region of the Loess Plateau in northwestern China to quantify the architectural and anatomical root traits of maize (Zea mays L.) in response to plastic film mulching and N fertilization. We compared four treatments: non-mulching with and without N supply as well as plastic film mulching with and without N supply. Variation existed for all root architecture and anatomy traits within maize root crowns. Crown and brace root angles to the soil line decreased in response to film mulching and N fertilization. Crown roots under plastic film mulching showed a significantly decreased distance to branching, reduced lateral root length, and overall increased root diameter. Similarly, N application significantly decreased the distance to branching, yet induced more compact and denser crown roots, and increased the root diameter. Brace roots exhibited an increased distance to branching, greater lateral root length and density, as well as a larger root diameter in response to plastic film mulching and N fertilization. Additionally, the accumulated number of nodal roots increased greatly under plastic film mulching and N treatments. At the anatomical level, N application reduced the proportion of the root cortical aerenchyma area. In contrast, aerenchyma area, cortex cell size, and late metaxylem vessel diameter were increased as a result of plastic film mulching. These results demonstrate root architectural and anatomical traits respond to mulching practices and N fertilization.

ORGANIC FERTILIZER INCREASES SOIL ORGANIC CARBON AND CROP YIELD IN FOUR-YEAR TILLAGE AND CROP ROTATIONS ON THE LOESS PLATEAU, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												To define the role of organic or inorganic fertilizers in the stability and sustainability of soil organic carbon (SOC) and crop yield, we examined changes in SOC and crop yield, as well as their correlation, in nine different fertilization treatments (sheep manure [M], sheep manure and urea [MN], sheep manure and diammonium phosphate [MP], sheep manure, urea, and diammonium phosphate [MNP], urea and diammonium phosphate [NP], urea and potassium sulfate [NK], diammonium phosphate and potassium sulfate [PK], diammonium phosphate, urea, and potassium sulfate [NPK], no fertilizer [CK]) from 2015 to 2018 on the Loess Plateau. The organic carbon content was higher in organic fertilizer (M, MNP, MP, MN) than in inorganic fertilizer treatments (NP, NPK, NK, PK) and the control. Crop yield was higher for organic than for inorganic fertilizers, whereas that of the control was always lower than those in the fertilization treatments. The highest crop yield was obtained in MNP. Crop yield and soil organic matter quality score correlated positively, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.5994 to 0.7151. Our results provide a theoretical basis for organic and inorganic fertilizer application in dry farming areas on the Loess Plateau and aid the long-term healthy development of soil in cultivated areas.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2022	20	5					4271	4282		10.15666/aeer/2005_42714282	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2005_42714282		JUL 2022											WOS:000862835900001

Wild soybean (Glycine soja) expressed higher tolerance to P-limited environment compared to cultivated soybeans (Glycine max). In this study, wild and cultivated soybean were used to compare the changes and differences in young and old leaves by ion contents and the kinds, number, and metabolic pathways of small molecule metabolites analysis under low P conditions. Our results showed that under low P conditions, Mg2+, Fe3+, and SO42- increased in young and old leaves of wild soybean; NO3- increased in young leaves of wild soybean and decreased in old leaves; H2PO4- was relatively stable in young leaves of wild soybean. And then, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism was enhanced and hexose-phosphate metabolism was inhibited in young and old leaves of wild soybean; aspartic acid family amino acids, glutamic acid family amino acids, serine family amino acids, aromatic amino acids metabolisms in young and old leaves of wild soybean were enhanced which contributed to the reuse of amino acids; disaccharides metabolism in young leaves of wild soybean was enhanced. Our experiment indicated that wild soybean could tolerate low P by promoting ion, disaccharides and amino acid metabolites accumulation and reuse in young and old leaves, and enhancing the energy metabolism in young and old leaves, and promoting the decomposition of hexose-phosphate in old leaves for reuse in young leaves. Our results provided a new insight for the cultivation of new soybean varieties with tolerance to P deficiency.																			0721-7595	1435-8107				OCT	2022	41	7					3046	3060		10.1007/s00344-021-10495-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10495-z		SEP 2021											WOS:000696756600001

However, the reasons and mechanism have not yet been analyzed. We speculated that the differential effects of N addition are related to the N addition rate, root diameter, and temperature. Meanwhile, tree and understory herb in forest ecosystems maybe another reason that root respiration has different responses. Methods N addition was performed in a Pinus tabulaeformis forest for six years. P. tabulaeformis and Carex lanceolata fine roots with three size classes (< 0.5 mm; 0.5-1.0 mm; 1.0-2.0 mm) were sampled for respiration and temperature sensitivity measurement at three temperatures and chemical analysis. Results (1) N addition increased the root respiration of P. tabulaeformis and had the maximum values in 3, 6, and 9 g N m(-2) y(-1) at 1 degrees C, 14 degrees C, and 18 degrees C, respectively. (2) The root respiration of C. lanceolata significantly decreased under N addition only at 18 degrees C. (3) The effect of N addition on temperature sensitivity of root respiration was also varied due to N addition rate. (4) N and carbon/nitrogen ratio were the main driving factors of root respiration of P. tabulaeformis, while chemical properties had a slight driving effect on root respiration of C. lanceolata. Conclusions N addition rate and temperature were the reasons for the differential effect of N addition on root respiration, but not root diameter. Furthermore, root respirations of tree and understory herb have varied changing mechanism, which demonstrated an apparent species specificity.

Spatio and temporal variations in population abundance and distribution of peach fruit fly, <i>Bactrocera zonata</i> (Saunders) during future climate change scenarios based on temperature driven phenology model	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT												The peach fruit fly, Bactrocera zonata (Saunders) (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a poylphagous and serious insect pest of horticultural crops. The purpose of study was to understand the spatial and temporal variations in population abundance and distribution of B. zonata in response to climate change-based variations in temperature across the India. To examine the likely possibilities of changes in abundance and distribution of B. zonata, temperature driven process based phenology models were linked with climatic data of multiple General Circulation Model (eight models) and climate change scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) using the Insect Life Cycle Modeling (ILCYM) software. The risk indices (establishment, generation, and activity index) were mapped and quantified the changes in respect to locations, scenarios, models and times (2050 & 2070). The risk indices results revealed that, 1.73 (0.8-1.0 establishment risk), 14.15 (>16 high abundance) and 59.69% (>8.0 generation per year) area is projected to be highly suitable for B. zonata regarding establishment, abundance and generation indices, respectively in India under current climatic conditions. In spite of decreased permanent establishment (Establishment Risk Index > 0.6) in future climatic conditions, it is predicted that abundance and generation indices would increase in all the locations of the country. The variation in the results due to use of multiple GCM-scenario combinations suggested that choice of GCM and scenario combinations have impact on future prediction of the species. Overall, results indicate that B. zonata would be significant threat to horticultural crops in India. Therefore, present findings are of immensly useful to provide important information to design integrated pest management strategies and phytosanitary measurements for local, regional and national level to restrain the insect pest activity across different layers.					mali, santosh S/I-1602-2014	mali, santosh S/0000-0001-9058-9311; Choudhary, Jaipal S./0000-0002-4475-191X													2212-0963						2021	32								100277	10.1016/j.crm.2021.100277	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2021.100277		FEB 2021											WOS:000663363200008

In a world of climate warming and melting glaciers, alpine gravel encroachment was occurring universally and threatening hillside grassland ecosystem. Gravel encroachment caused by climate warming and glacial melting may alter community structure and community stability in alpine meadow. Yet, the effects of climate warming-induced gravel encroachment on grassland communities are unknown. Here, a 1-year short-term field experiment was conducted to explore the early stage drive process of gravel encroachment on community structure and stability at four different gravel encroachment levels 0%, 30%, 60%, and 90% gravel coverage at an alpine meadow on the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau, by analyzing the changes of dominant species stability and species asynchrony to the simulated gravel encroachment processes. Gravel encroachment rapidly changed the species composition and species ranking of alpine meadow plant community in a short period of time. Specifically, community stability of alpine meadow decreased by 61.78-79.48%, which may be due to the reduced dominant species stability and species asynchrony. Species asynchrony and dominant species stability were reduced by 2.65-17.39% and 46.51-67.97%, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that gravel encroachment presents a severe negative impact on community structure and stability of alpine meadow in the short term, the longer term and comprehensive study should be conducted to accurate prediction of global warming-induced indirect effects on alpine grassland ecosystems.

J	Su, FY; Hao, MD; Wei, XR				Su, Fuyuan; Hao, Mingde; Wei, Xiaorong			Soil organic C and N dynamics as affected by 31 years cropping systems and fertilization in highland agroecosystems	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Cropping systems and fertilization have important effects on soil organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) turnover and availability; however, little information exists about the interaction of cropping system and fertilization. Herein, we analyzed the dynamics of soil OC and N in a 31-year experiment in a highland agroecosystem to understand how the effects of fertilization vary with cropping systems. The experiment included different cropping systems, and each system included various fertilization treatments. The cropping systems were continuous alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), continuous winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and grain-legume rotation of winter wheat + millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) -pea (Pisum sativum L.) -winter wheat. The fertilization treatments were the control (CK), phosphorous (P), P and nitrogen (NP) and NP and manure (NPM). A bare fallow treatment that did not receive any crop and fertilizer was designed to compare the effects of the cropping systems. The soil samples were collected at different times of the experiment. The contents of OC, N, and labile OC were measured, and the carbon management index was calculated. When averaged across the experimental periods, soil OC, N, labile OC and carbon management index were significantly higher in the pure legume (i.e., continuous alfalfa) system than in the bare fallow and nonlegume system (i.e., continuous winter wheat) due to the higher C and N inputs from root biomass. The NP and NPM significantly increased these soil variables, and the effects of NPM were greater than those of NP due to the higher supplying of C and N in NPM treatment than NP treatment. However, the effects of NP or NPM on soil OC and N contents were similar among the cropping systems. The effects of P were greater in the continuous alfalfa system but smaller in the continuous winter wheat system in comparison with those in the grain-legume rotation system. Therefore, at the conditions of our study, legume-included cropping systems with large root biomass and manure combined with chemical fertilizers have the potential to increase OC and N and their availability in highland soils, which could be important strategies for improving soil fertility and quality and sequestrating C in soils. Moreover, P fertilizer was recommended for the legume-included cropping systems.

Particularly, agroforestry could provide biomass residues for improved bioenergy products. The aim of this study was to characterize the interest of growers to provide biomass residues to a hypothetical biomass feedstock market. This study relied on a survey conducted on a sample of 240 farmers. Although the awareness of potential biomass products was generally quite low, a majority of farmers expressed interest in supplying biomass residues, but the level of interest depended on certain individual socio-economic and demographic characteristics. For example, younger and female household heads were found to be more interested in participating in the hypothetical biomass market, as were households with an improved biomass stove, larger land holdings, and higher income levels. In addition, larger households and those that felt less vulnerable to firewood scarcity also expressed more interest. As a whole, the results imply that farmers, particularly those with younger and female heads of households, should be supported with programs tailored to ensure their inclusion in biomass supply chains. Respondents generally preferred farm-gate sales of biomass, so the collecting, baling, and transporting of woody residues need to be properly incentivized or new actors need to be recruited into the supply chain. Providing households with energy-efficient tools such as improved stoves would not only increase demand for biomass products, but also increase the amount of biomass residues that could be supplied to the market instead of used at home.					nigussie, zerihun/AAV-9190-2020; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/L-8526-2013; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/J-5616-2015	nigussie, zerihun/0000-0002-8001-2073; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/0000-0002-7690-0633; Haregeweyn, Nigussie/0000-0003-2920-8094													0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2021	68	4					553	565		10.1007/s00267-021-01524-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-021-01524-4		AUG 2021						34427762					WOS:000687902100001
J	Ning, TT; Liu, WZ; Li, Z; Feng, Q				Ning, Tingting; Liu, Wenzhao; Li, Zhi; Feng, Qi			Modelling and attributing evapotranspiration changes on China's Loess Plateau with Budyko framework considering vegetation dynamics and climate seasonality	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												The Grain for Green Project in China's Loess Plateau has significantly increased the vegetation coverage (M) since it was implemented in 1999. Accurately modelling evapotranspiration (ET) and attributing its changes are important for assessing the hydrological effects of revegetation in this area. Budyko-based models have been widely used to estimate ET whereby the controlling parameter (omega) captures the effects of land surface conditions and climate seasonality. Although the effects of climate seasonality on ET variation have been theoretically discussed, its important role in omega remains further investigation. An improved climate seasonality and asynchrony index (SAI) was thus used to reflect the seasonality and asynchrony of water and energy distribution in this study. Then omega was extended to M and SAI at grid scale to model annual ET by linking Fu equation in China's Loess Plateau for the period 1981-2012. Further, the whole study period was split into two sub-periods at the year of 1999, and then the complementary method was used to quantify the contributions of precipitation (P), potential evapotranspiration (E-0), M and SAI changes to ET variation between the two sub-periods. The results showed that ET increased by 5.1 mm/yr after 1999. ET is most sensitive to changes in P, followed by M, E-0, and SAI. However, increasing M dominated the overall increase in ET, outweighing the effects of decreasing P and increasing SAI. Because SAI accounted for almost a third of total ET change, the impacts of climate seasonality cannot be ignored in ET simulation and attribution analysis.

Laser-induced graphene composite adhesive tape with electro-photo-thermal heating and antimicrobial capabilities	CARBON												Laser-induced graphene (LIG) and its composites have been demonstrated to be useful in broad-reaching ap-plications such as water and air filtration and sensors. A main advantage of LIG is the embedding of conformal graphene foam in any design into polymeric substrates. However, embedded LIG must be detached from the substrate for a composite nanomaterial, and delamination of LIG has been demonstrated. Here, we incorporated LIG as a composite into a double-sided tape using pressure-sensitive adhesives and delamination from the sub-strate, and demonstrated its use for electro-photo-thermal applications, including bacterial inactivation. LIG was transferred onto thermally conductive pressure-sensitive adhesive containing carbon black, and a double-sided sticky tape was prepared by sandwiching perforated tissue adhesive between two LIG layers, giving enhanced electrical conductivity in the x, y, and z directions compared to commercial carbon tape. The LIG composite tape showed excellent electrothermal properties with a maximum temperature > 120 C at 10 V and a temperature rise > 70 C under 120 mW/cm(2) solar irradiation. The same electrothermal activity was observed after 50 heating and cooling cycles and reached a temperature of-111 C. Bacterial inactivation was observed on the surface of the LIG composite tape at-3.5 V, and electro-and photothermal effects caused sterilization of the surfaces up to 99.99%. These electrically conductive LIG composite adhesive tapes might be used in electronic applications for heating surfaces at low voltages (< 9 V) or to prevent surface biofilm or microbial growth.

Christopher; Miniat, Chelcy Ford; Bolstad, Paul			An evaluation of ECOSTRESS products of a temperate montane humid forest in a complex terrain environment	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Plant water use is difficult to monitor and predict in complex terrain. NASA's ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) provides new data for understanding hydrologic cycling in these forested mountain areas. Evaluation of ECOSTRESS evapotranspiration (ET) has relied primarily on eddy flux towers, but most flux towers are located in flat terrain, sampling relatively homogeneous vegetation. To address this knowledge gap, the accuracy of the ECOSTRESS land surface temperature (L2_LST) and ET (L3_ET_PT-JPL) data were evaluated against data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service's Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory: a humid temperate forest ecosystem in the southern Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern U.S. with extensive data from one eddy covariance tower and five climate stations varying in elevation. ECOSTRESS LST showed a strong linear relationship with the weather station near-surface air temperature (R-2 = 0.85; offset =-2.5 degrees C), showing no difference across slope, aspect and elevation, but a higher correlation during the night than the day. ECOSTRESS tended to overestimate ET compared with our site eddy covariance measurements (R-2 = 0.43; RMSE = 146 W m(-2)). To evaluate potential sources of error associated with remotely-sensed inputs to the ECOSTRESS Priestly-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) ET model, we ran PT-JPL using ground-based data from our site. ET estimated with locally-collected data showed much better performance in capturing variability (R-2 similar to 0.70), illustrating the uncertainty contributed to ECOSTRESS by the coarse scale meteorological inputs in areas of complex topography. Notably, both the ECOSTRESS LST and ET captured important topographic gradients and spatially-explicit diurnal variability. The valley floor of the Coweeta Basin was warmer than the higher elevations by 8 degrees C in the day, but cooler at night. On the south facing aspects, LST and ET were higher, consistent with observations. This also highlights the ability of ECOSTRESS and PT-JPL to decouple ET from LST when and where appropriate, as they are normally inverse to one another. Our study provides the first detailed analysis of ECOSTRESS for forested ecosystems in complex terrain and offers insight for future evaluation.

Rill erosion is an important cause of water and soil loss in spoil tips. This study investigated the rill erosion on spoil tip slopes, the morphological changes of rills and the mechanisms of rill erosion. A field runoff plot (5 m long, 1 m wide and 0.5 m deep) with three inflow rates (1.6, 2 and 2.4 mm min-1) and three typical slopes (28 degrees, 32 degrees and 36 degrees) was used for runoff simulation experiments. Results showed that inflow rate was the most important factor affecting soil erosion, which contributed 68.87% and 60.54% to the runoff rate and soil loss rate, respectively. Rill development has three stages: formation, development and adjustment. The overall predominance of parallel-shaped rills suggested that rill formation was dominated by concentrated runoff. Inflow rate exerted the greatest effect on the average rill width and average rill depth, with contribution rates of 73.11% and 60.26%, respectively. Meanwhile, slope exerted the greatest effect on the rill width-to-depth ratio, with a contribution of 60.45%. The average rill depth was the best indicator of rill morphology for evaluating rill erosion. Reynolds number was the best hydraulic parameter for predicting rill erosion. Flow shear stress was the best hydrodynamic parameter to describe rill erosion mechanism, with a critical value of 1.98 Pa. These results contributed to elucidating the rill erosion mechanism of spoil tip slope and provided a scientific basis for its soil erosion control.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				JUL	2022	214								106249	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106249		APR 2022											WOS:000797947400002

However, the current understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of field hillslope erosion processes is limited. In this study, fourteen runoff scouring experiments were undertaken on two plots (A and B) established on one field slope of the hilly and gully loess plateau in China. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was employed to investigate soil erosion processes across the hillslopes of the plots. The results demonstrated that the TLS-derived cumulative sediment yields of the hillslopes were more accurate than the TLS-derived consecutive sediment yields (i.e., the sediment yields for individual experiments). The magnitudes of the mean absolute/relative errors for the TLS-derived cumulative sediment yield for slopes A and B were 0.87 kg/25.02% and 1.26 kg/56.82%, respectively, with the linear relation R-2 between the calculated and measured values over 0.60 (p < 0.001). The sediment yields from the hillslopes fluctuated considerably even when the runoff production became stable, leading to a weak relationship between the sediment yield and runoff discharge (the R-2 values for slopes A and B were 0.57 (p = 0.002) and 0.08 (p = 0.321) for inter-experiments, and 0.37 (p < 0.001) and 0.06 (p = 0.035) for intra-experiments, respectively). The development of hillslope erosion was found to experience three major stages, which included a rapid increase and widespread distribution, a sharp decrease, and a stable distribution of the area with erosion/deposition. The rill development impacted the cumulative erosion and sediment yield rather than the cumulative deposition, with the impacts of rill depth and rill width development being stronger than those of rill length. The peak sediment yield corresponded well with the evolution of rills, partly accounting for the weak relationship between runoff and sediment yield. Our results provide a useful reference for the development of process-based soil erosion models and the establishment of spatially targeted control of soil erosion.

Crantz) Genotypes in Response to Sowing Date under Mediterranean Environment	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Given the growing interest for camelina, as a multipurpose oilseed crop, seven cultivars and two sowing times were compared to characterize camelina's production potential in the rainfed agroecosystems of Central Italy. A split-plot design, with sowing date as main plot (autumn and spring) and cultivar (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, and CELINE) as subplot, was adopted over two growing seasons (2017-2019). Phenology, yield and yield components, protein and oil content, and fatty acid profile were evaluated. Going from autumn to spring sowing, a significant reduction was observed in the number of days (139 vs. 54 days) and GDD (642 vs. 466 degrees C d) from emergence to beginning of flowering, with more consistent variations among cultivars. V1 and V2 were the earlier ones both in spring and autumn sowing. Autumn sowing increased seed yield (+18.0%), TSW (+4.1%), number of siliques per plant (+47.2%), contents of alpha-linolenic, eicosenoic, erucic and eicosadienoic acids, and polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio. Regarding genotype, V3 showed the best seed and oil yield in autumn, whereas V1 and CELINE were the best performing in spring. Finally, TSW and number of siliques per plant were the key yield components for camelina. Results identify, in relation to sowing date, the most suitable cultivars for the tested environment, in terms of earliness and quanti-qualitative traits.

Decreasing Defoliation Frequency Enhances <i>Bromus valdivianus</i> Phil. Growth under Low Soil Water Levels and Interspecific Competition	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Bromus valdivianus Phil. (Bv) is a water stress-tolerant species, but its competitiveness in a diverse pasture may depend on defoliation management and soil moisture levels. This glasshouse study examined the effect of three defoliation frequencies, based on accumulated growing degree days (AGDD) (250, 500, and 1000 AGDD), and two soil water levels (80-85% of field capacity (FC) and 20-25% FC) on Bv growth as monoculture and as a mixture with Lolium perenne L. (Lp). The treatments were applied in a completely randomised block design with four blocks. The above-ground biomass of Bv was lower in the mixture than in the monoculture (p <= 0.001). The Bv plants in the mixture defoliated more infrequently (1000 AGDD) showed an increase in root biomass under 20-25% FC compared to 80-85% FC, with no differences measured between soil water levels in the monoculture. Total root length was highest in the mixture with the combination of infrequent defoliation and 20-25% FC. Conversely, frequent defoliation treatments resulted in reduced water-soluble carbohydrate reserves in the tiller bases of plants (p <= 0.001), as they allocated assimilates mainly to foliage growth. These results provide evidence that B. valdivianus can increase its competitiveness relative to Lp through the enhancement of the root growth and the energy reserve in the tiller base under drought conditions and infrequent defoliation in a mixture.

However, the potential impact of higher burn severity on ecosystem resilience and regional carbon balance is still not clear. There are ongoing debates regarding whether increased burn severity stimulates or delays postfire vegetation and carbon recovery. In this study, we utilized remote sensing data to analyze burn severity and vegetation observations, as well as model simulations to assess wildfire carbon emissions and ecosystem carbon fluxes. Our focus was on examining the dynamics of vegetation and carbon flux following wildfires spanning up to 16 years in California, a region that has experienced significant intensification in burn severity over the past two decades. Our findings revealed that more severe burns resulted in greater vegetation damage and carbon releases. However, they also facilitated faster postfire vegetation and carbon recovery. In comparison to the average burn severity, the most severe burns caused an additional 62-128 % loss of vegetation, 21-80 % higher instant wildfire carbon emissions, and 45-110 % more postfire carbon sources. Nonetheless, high-severity burns exhibited accelerated postfire recoveries in both vegetation growth and ecosystem carbon sink. Carbon sinks, which persisted for up to 15 years after high-severity burns, partially offset a significant proportion of the extra postfire carbon sources, ranging from 84 to 107 % (excluding instant emissions). However, this offset effect was insufficient to fully compensate for the combined impact of postfire carbon sources and instant wildfire carbon emissions. Consequently, on the decadal time scale relevant to regional climate policies, the increasing severity of fires poses a threat to the objective of maintaining California's natural and working lands as a net carbon sink. Moreover, it exacerbates climate warming by enhancing carbon releases from ecosystems.

However, little is known about how this affects other non-market exchange relationships. The present paper addresses this knowledge gap using qualitative data gathered from small-scale farmers at three selected sites in northern Ethiopia. We took a social exchange theory perspective to examine how resource exchanges have altered after-market orientations in rural communities. The results indicate that, in addition to the benefits for better-off households, integration into the market economy improves the bargaining power and autonomy of middle-income groups as well as the physically fit younger generations. The results also suggest that market orientation generates new livelihood opportunities and market-based relationships, which in turn facilitate the formalisation and transformation of local institutions. On the other hand, market orientation has adverse impacts on traditional practices of resource exchange - such as labour for labour, oxen for labour, labour for harvest/yield, or labour for food - or the exchange of other services. Our results indicate that because these in-kind resource exchange relationships have been replaced by monetary transactions, the poor have become even more vulnerable. The policy implication is that while promoting market-driven approaches to food security, complementary mechanisms must be put in place to empower those living in the most vulnerable conditions.																			0016-7185	1872-9398				NOV	2021	126						350	360		10.1016/j.geoforum.2021.07.026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2021.07.026		SEP 2021											WOS:000709526700021

However, research into the relationships between vegetation and soil properties has mainly focused on an overall degradation stage, and few studies have investigated which soil properties can impact vegetation change at different stages of degradation. Vegetation and soil properties were observed in the field and measured in the laboratory for different predefined stages of degradation for alpine grassland in Maduo County in the source region of the Yellow River. Results show that: 1) the aboveground and belowground biomass, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, nitrate, and ammonia content did not decrease significantly from the intact to moderate degradation stage, but decreased significantly at severe and very severe stages of degradation; 2) dominant plant species shifted from gramineaes and sedges to forbs; 3) the species richness and Pielou evenness indices decreased significantly at the very severe degradation stage, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index increased at the slight and moderate degradation, but decreased at the severe and very severe degradation stages; 4) soil bulk density was the strongest soil driver for changes in the plant biomass and community diversity at the intact, slight and moderate degradation stages, whereas soil organic carbon and nitrate nitrogen content were the main driving factors for changes in plant biomass and diversity at the severe and very severe degradation stages. Our results suggest that there may be different interactions between soil properties and plants before and after moderate stages of degradation.

The present study aims at closing this gap considering the effect of temperature, soil pH and pCO(2). CO2 uptake was studied with the help of the Barometric Process Separation (BaPS) technique. CO2 uptake was studied at 3 different temperatures viz. 15, 20 and 25 degrees C. CO2 uptake was observed after CO2 injection with pH values ranging from 8 to 10 in desert Solonchak soils. We found that CO2 uptake depended on pCO(2) and temperature. CO2 uptake occurred rapidly within the first 10 min after the CO2 injection and gradually slowed down afterwards. Results showed that 72%-97% of injected CO2 was taken up by soils (pH 8-10). CO2 uptake increased as soil pH increased and its uptake reached equilibrium faster in soil with a lower pH level (pH < 9) than in soil with a higher pH level (pH >= 9). Dissolved CO2 (CO2eq) (mu mol ml(-1)) increased with increasing CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) with equation y = a (1-b(x)) (r(2) > 0.96) and pH. The lower temperature produced a higher CO2aq for the same pCO(2) value. In conclusion, desert soils can rapidly uptake of CO2, and the main controlling process of CO2 uptake in the desert soils was decided by soil pH and temperature. The CO2 uptake by the soil solution may be an important pathway for C sequestration in semi-desert and desert regions.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				AUG 15	2019	348						60	67		10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.04.012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.04.012													WOS:000470042500007

PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL												Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important grain legume providing high-quality cooking oil, rich proteins and other nutrients. Shelling percentage (SP) is the 2nd most important agronomic trait after pod yield and this trait significantly affects the economic value of peanut in the market. Deployment of diagnostic markers through genomics-assisted breeding (GAB) can accelerate the process of developing improved varieties with enhanced SP. In this context, we deployed the QTL-seq approach to identify genomic regions and candidate genes controlling SP in a recombinant inbred line population (Yuanza 9102 x Xuzhou 68-4). Four libraries (two parents and two extreme bulks) were constructed and sequenced, generating 456.89-790.32 million reads and achieving 91.85%-93.18% genome coverage and 14.04-21.37 mean read depth. Comprehensive analysis of two sets of data (Yuanza 9102/two bulks and Xuzhou 68-4/two bulks) using the QTL-seq pipeline resulted in discovery of two overlapped genomic regions (2.75 Mb on A09 and 1.1 Mb on B02). Nine candidate genes affected by 10 SNPs with non-synonymous effects or in UTRs were identified in these regions for SP. Cost-effective KASP (Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR) markers were developed for one SNP from A09 and three SNPs from B02 chromosome. Genotyping of the mapping population with these newly developed KASP markers confirmed the major control and stable expressions of these genomic regions across five environments. The identified candidate genomic regions and genes for SP further provide opportunity for gene cloning and deployment of diagnostic markers in molecular breeding for achieving high SP in improved varieties.

Combining trait- and individual-based modelling to understand desert plant community dynamics	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Understanding the mechanisms driving community dynamics helps us to make reliable predictions about communities' response to environmental change. Studying desert plant communities is particularly challenging because of strong intraand interannual fluctuations in precipitation. Models rise to this challenge by providing an arena for systematic evaluation of the parameter space in virtual experiments. We applied a traitand individual-based model to explore how community dynamics arise from the plant traits and interactions of plants with other plants and with their environment. The model is based on data from annual plant communities in the Negev Desert dominated by the True Rose of Jericho (Anastatica hierochuntica). We showed that functional traits that are involved in plant-plant interactions are equally important for community dynamics as traits promoting tolerance to abiotic stress. The sensitivity analysis of the model highlights relative growth rate, maximum biomass, the amount of time in dormancy and germination probability as the most important traits for community dynamics. The model reflects the particular importance of environmental factors such as precipitation and soil water availability based on topography for community dynamics. Our model benelits from the ability of individual-based models to capture plant-plant interactions and derive community properties from individual characteristics and from the feature of trait-based approaches to link traits to organismal functions.

Phenological mismatches and the demography of solitary bees	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Species respond idiosyncratically to environmental variation, which may generate phenological mismatches. We assess the consequences of such mismatches for solitary bees. During 9 years, we studied flowering phenology and nesting phenology and demography of five wood-nesting solitary bee species representing a broad gradient of specialization/generalization in the use of floral resources. We found that the reproductive performance and population growth rate of bees tended to be lower with increasing nesting-flowering mismatches, except for the most generalized bee species. Our findings help elucidate the role of phenological mismatches for the demography of wild pollinators, which perform key ecosystem functions and provide important services for humanity. Furthermore, if climate change increases phenological mismatches in this system, we expect negative consequences of climate change for specialist bees.

The van Genuchten (VG) model is widely used to describe the SWRC; however, estimation of its effective hydraulic parameters is often prone to error, especially when data exist for only a limited range of matric potential. We developed a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MH-MCMC) approach using R to estimate VG parameters, which produces a numerical estimate of the joint posterior distribution of model parameters, including fully-quantified uncertainties. When VG model parameters were obtained using complete range of soil water content (SWC) data (i.e., from saturation to oven dryness), the MH-MCMC approach returned similar accuracy as the widely used non-linear curve-fitting program RETC (RETention Curve), but avoiding non-convergence issues. When VG model parameters were obtained using 5 SWC data measured at matric potential of around -60, -100, -200, -500, and -15,000 cm, the MH-MCMC approach was more robust than the RETC program. The performance of MH-MCMC are generally good (R-2 > 0.95) for all 8 soils, whereas the RETC underperformed for coarse-textured soils. The MH-MCMC approach was used to obtain VG model parameters for all 1871 soils in the National Cooperative Soil Characterization dataset with SWC measured at matric potentials of -60 cm, -100 cm, -330 cm, and -15,000 cm; the results showed that the simulated SWC by MH-MCMC model were highly consistent with the measured SWC at corresponding matric potential. Altogether, our new MH-MCMC approach to solving the VG model is more robust to limited coverage of soil matric potential when compared to the RETC procedures, making it an effective alternative to traditional water retention solvers. We developed an MH-MCMC code in R for solving VG model parameters, which can be found at the GitHub repository.

However, the variation in regional energy consumption and limited data availability make estimating long-term global anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) challenging. Thus, using high-resolution population density data (30 arc-second) and a top-down inventory-based approach, this study developed a new global gridded AHF dataset covering 1970-2050 based historically on energy consumption data from the British Petroleum (BP); future projections were built on estimated future energy demands. The globally averaged terrestrial AHFs were estimated at 0.05, 0.13, and 0.16 W/m(2) in 1970, 2015, and 2050, respectively, but varied greatly among countries and regions. Multiple validation results indicate that the past and future global gridded AHF (PF-AHF) dataset has reasonable accuracy in reflecting AHF at various scales. The PF-AHF dataset has longer time series and finer spatial resolution than previous data and provides powerful support for studying long-term climate change at various scales.

This study looked at heavy metal concentrations, concentrations in relation to threshold values, and assessments of risk for noncarcinogenic and cancer risk threat. The Microwave Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (MP-AES 4210) series instrument of Agilent Technology, United States of America (USA), was used in analyzing heavy metal (Cd, Cu, and Pb) concentrations. The result of the analysis of the Kuka Bulukiya treatment point revealed that Pb has the highest mean concentration of 0.0693 ppm, Cu 0.0525 parts per million (PPM), and Cd 0.0042 ppm. The mean concentration at PRP Gidan Ruwa for Cd was found to be 0.0059 ppm, Cu 0.0363 ppm, and Pb 0.049 ppm. The result of the adult and children population calculated shows that the hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) values are not up to 1 in all the pathways (inhalation, ingestion, and dermal) at both treatment points (1.2 x 10(-4) and 9.8 x 10(-5)) and (6.4 x 10(-4) and 5.9 x 10(-4)), respectively. The cancer risk for Kuka Bulukiya 6 x 10(-)(10) and PRP G/Ruwa 5 x 10(-)(10) for adults and 7 x 10(-)(10) and 4 x 10(-)(10) for children were both lower than the threshold set for cancer risk by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). This meant that both adults and children were not at risk of cancer and noncarcinogenic threat based on the assessment in this study. The study concluded that informal e-waste burning has substantially helped in the relatively high levels of air pollution identified in the treatment points and in turn posed environmental and public health concerns to people around the area. This study recommends that samples of the vegetable products at the PRP G/Ruwa treatment point should be investigated immediately and adequate restrictions and regulations should be enacted and enforced in order to safeguard the environment and the populace. There is need for caution from the authorities to avert the possible implications (e-waste extractors and the public) of being affected with noncarcinogenic or carcinogenic ailments over time.

In this study, aspect was incorporated as a variable into three machine learning algorithms (MLAs) (support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF)), to estimate the AGB of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) planted forests in 96 field plots with four different aspects (sunny slope, semisunny slope, semi-shady slope and shady slope). The results showed that in the models incorporating aspect variables, the increase in accuracy varied from 36.72% to 41.23% for 29 validation plots based on R2. The A-RF model (RF with aspect variable), which had the highest R2 (0.8519) and lowest RMSE and rRMSE (12.552 Mg/ha and 0.175) was considered optimal for AGB estimation of black locust planted forests. The overestimation of sunny and shady slopes, and the underestimation of semi-sunny and semi-shady slopes are reduced by incorporating the aspect variable. Areas with lower AGB values mainly occur on sunny and shady slopes, and areas with higher AGB values mainly occur on semi-sunny and semi-shady slopes. Overall, our study demonstrates that the introduction of the aspect variable provided the model with a basis for the effects of different growth conditions of black locust planted forests on different aspects, which can improve the accuracy of AGB estimation.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2021	129								107948	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107948	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107948		JUL 2021											WOS:000681689400005

In order to evaluate the seed yield stability of advanced chickpea genotypes under tropical and subtropical rainfed areas of Iran, 18 advanced chickpea genotypes and two check varieties (Adel and Azad) were studied in terms of randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications in four locations including Gachsaran, Gonbad, Khorramabad and Ilam using GGE biplot analysis during three growing seasons (2014-2017). Results of GGE biplot analysis and which-won-where pattern revealed that the genotype G13 was the most stable genotype for Khorramabad, Gachsaran and Gonbad while it was genotype G12 for Ilam According to average tester coordinate (ATC), the genotype G13 was the most stable one across average test environment. The genotype G13 was also determined as a stable and high yielding genotype among all investigated genotypes and environments. Based on the average yield and Shukla Stability Index, as well as the mean of yield to maximum or Superiority Index (SI), G12, G13 genotypes were superior to the other genotypes in all regions with warm climate and thus be recommended.

Landscape connectivity explains interaction network patterns at multiple scales	ECOLOGY												Under a metacommunity framework, the spatial configuration of habitat fragments could determine local community structure. Yet, quantifying fragment connectivity is challenging, as it depends on multiple variables at several geographical scales. We assessed the extent to which fragment connectivity and area explain patterns in interaction structure among four herbivore guilds and their host plants in a metacommunity. We propose an integrative connectivity metric including geographic distance, neighboring fragment area and similarity in resource composition as an extension of Hanski's classic metric. We then used nonlinear models to assess whether fragment connectivity and area predicted link richness and similarity in link composition. We found that link richness was always negatively related to connectivity but at different geographic scales depending on the herbivore guild. In contrast, while link composition was also related to connectivity, the direction and strength of this relationship varied among herbivore guilds and type of link composition (qualitative or quantitative). Furthermore, focal fragment area was not an important determinant of interaction diversity in local communities. Our findings emphasize resource similarity as a novel dimension of fragment connectivity relevant in explaining interaction diversity patterns in natural trophic networks.

However, the response of soil C mineralization to different vegetation restoration types remains unclear. In this study, three vegetation restoration types for the restoration of cropland, namely forestland (Robinia pseudoaca-cia), shrubland (Caragana korshinskii), and grassland (Artemisia sacrorum and Stipa bungeana), were selected to determine how vegetation restoration types affect soil C mineralization. The vegetation in the assessed areas had been restored 20 years before this study. The results showed that vegetation restoration significantly increased soil CO2 efflux, whereas soil C mineralization efficiency (CME) decreased after cropland conversion. The lowest soil CO2 efflux and CME were observed in forestland, with the highest stable soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Vegetation restoration significantly increased SOC and its C fraction stocks, and the variation in soil C fractions was regulated by vegetation restoration type. Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) effectively reflected the variation in soil C mineralization and stability of the SOC pool, respectively. Soil CO2 efflux was controlled by litter biomass, macroaggregates, particulate organic C, MBC, and DOC, whereas CME was mainly influenced by aboveground biomass, pH, silt and clay content, macroaggregates and DOC. The study suggested that forestland should be selected as the preferred vegetation restoration type in the central Loess Plateau owing to its lower CME with similar C stocks.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Wu, Jianzhao/0000-0003-3124-1109; Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564													0167-8809	1873-2305				NOV 1	2022	339								108144	10.1016/j.agee.2022.108144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108144		AUG 2022											WOS:000849766500002

BMC PLANT BIOLOGY												Background Grape is highly sensitive to gibberellin (GA), which is crucial during seed and berry development (SBD) either by itself or by interacting with other hormones, such as auxin, Abscisic acid (ABA), and Cytokinin (CK). However, no systematic analysis of GA metabolic and signal transduction (MST) pathway has been undertaken in grapevine. Results In this study, total endogenous GA(3)content significantly decreased during SBD, and a total of 48 known genes in GA metabolic (GAM; 31) and signal transduction (ST; 17) pathways were identified in this process. In the GAM pathway, out of 31 genes,VvGA20ox1-1,VvGA3ox4-1, andVvGA2ox1-1may be the major factors interacting at the green-berry stage (GBS) accompanied with higher accumulation rate. GA biosynthesis was greater than GA inactivation at GBS, confirming the importance of seeds in GA synthesis. The visible correlation between endogenous GA(3)content and gene expression profiles suggested that the transcriptional regulation of GA biosynthesis pathway genes was a key mechanism of GA accumulation at the stone-hardening stage (SHS). Interestingly, we observed a negative feedback regulation betweenVvGA3oxs-VvGAI1-4,VvGA2oxs-VvGAI1-4, andVvGID1B-VvGAI1-4in maintaining the balance of GA(3)content in berries. Moreover, 11 miRNAs may be involved in the modulation of GA MST pathway by mediating their target genes, such asVvGA3ox,VvGID1B, andVvGAMYB. Many genes in auxin, ABA, and CK MST pathways were further identified and found to have a special pattern in the berry, and the crosstalk between GA and these hormones may modulate the complex process during SBD through the interaction gene network of the multihormone pathway. Lastly, based on the expression characterization of multihormone MST pathway genes, a proposed model of the GA-mediated multihormone regulatory network during SBD was proposed. Conclusions Our results provided novel insights into GA-mediated regulatory networks during SBD in grape. The complexity of GA-mediated multihormone ST in SBD was also elucidated, thereby providing valuable information for future functional characterizations of specific genes in grape.

J	Dong, LX; Fu, SH; Liu, BY; Yin, B				Dong, Lixia; Fu, Suhua; Liu, Baoyuan; Yin, Bing			Comparison and quantitative assessment of two regional soil erosion survey approaches	INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Regional soil erosion surveys are the first step of soil conservation planning. Grid and sampling approaches are commonly used for soil erosion surveys at the regional scale. With the grid approach, the region is divided into grids (e.g., 1 km x 1 km), and the soil erosion rate of each grid was calculated. With the sampling approach, a small portion of the area (typically 4% or less) was taken and then the soil erosion rate was calculated. Based on the above calculation, both approaches evaluated the soil erosion area (which is the area where the soil erosion rate is greater than the soil loss tolerance (t)) and its distribution in the whole region. The purpose of this paper is to compare the assessment results of the two approaches and analyse their practicality using Yunyang County, Chongqing, China (area is 3636 km2). The soil erosion rate, percentage of soil erosion area (PSEA, which is the ratio of the area where the soil erosion rate is greater than the soil loss tolerance (t) to the area of the total study region) and its spatial distribution were compared between the two approaches. The results showed that the grid approach overestimated the average soil erosion rate and PSEA overall for all 33 sample units and the whole region in comparison to the sampling approach. The sampling approach can yield a reasonable spatial distribution of the soil erosion rate in the whole region. In addition, the soil erosion regions were more clustered than those using the grid approach, which can be more suitable for soil conservation planning. Therefore, the sampling approach is an efficient and practical approach in regional soil erosion surveys. The results can provide insights into regional soil erosion surveys.

Con-ventional weed control strategies pose challenges for integrating smart herbicide delivery and machinery sys-tems. This deep learning approach significantly impacts developing a system for weed identification required in establishing successful real time precision weed management systems like smart spraying systems and AI based smart machinery. Minimal research has been done on automatic weed identification in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) cropping systems. This study analyzed the feasibility of a computer vision based DL approach for weed identification to achieve autonomous weed control. The image dataset containing 5660 augmented images was deployed to train and evaluate DL models with a spilt of 90% for training and the rest for validation. We trained the six DL models for identifying weeds in sugarcane crop using field imagery (5094 images), validated (566 images) and further evaluated their accuracy and F1 score performance. Model training was undertaken by varying the hyperparameters, such as mini batch size (16 and 32) and epoch (10, 20 and 30) at a learning rate of 0.001. DarkNet53 accomplished a high F1 score value (>99%) and outperformed other models (AlexNet, Goo-gLeNet, InceptionV3, ResNet50, and Xception) for the identification of weeds in actively growing sugarcane crop. Weeds can be identified with a higher level of confidence (>98%) with a minimum error rate (<1%) at the mini batch size of 16 and epochs 20. Post-training and validation, DarkNet53 was tested (stage I) with an independent 200-image dataset followed by stage II testing (30 images) and obtained 96.6% net accuracy compared with naked eye weed identification. Based on the high - level performance of DarkNet53, we conclude that DL based weed identification laid a potential future avenue with an effective decision system in the machine vision aspects of a precision herbicide applicator for weed control in sugarcane fields through a low cost camera integrated with a single board computer.

This study was conducted to investigate the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers on parameters of phenology, growth performance, grain yield, yield components, grain protein content of groundnut, and residual soil nitrogen content in the northern Ethiopia during the growing season of 2017. Three levels of N (0, 15 and 30 kg ha(-1)) and four levels of P2O5 (0, 23, 46 and 69 kg ha(-1)) were set in factorial combinations of randomized complete block design with three replications. Results showed that an average total biomass yield increased by 22.5% for separate individual application of 15 kg N ha(-1) and by 16.6% for 46 kg P2O5 ha(-1) compared to control plots. Haulm yield increased by 29.17% for plots treated with N fertilization compared to control plots. Average pod yield increased by 85.4% for a combined application of 15 kg N ha(-1) and 46 kg P2O5 ha(-1) fertilizer scompared to the control plots. Plots fertilized with the highest combined rates of N and P have attained lower grain yield compared to the combined application of 15 kg N ha(-1) and 46 kg P2O5 ha(-1). The highest grain protein contents were obtained for a combined application of 30 kg N ha(-1) and zero P, and 15 kg N ha(-1) plus 46 kg P(2)O(5 )ha(-1). The highest N harvest index was obtained for control treatments and for plots treated with combined application of 15 kg N ha(-1) and 46 kg P2O5 ha(-1). Residual soil N content increased by 119% on plots with combined application of 15 kg N ha(-1) and 46 P2O5 ha(-1) compared to control plots. Based on our results, combined application of 15 kg N ha(-1) and 46 kg P2O5 ha(-1) was recommended for increasing grain yield, grain protein content and residual soil nitrogen. The results of this study are crucial to improve groundnut productivity, grain protein content and also to provide implication on soil fertility management in a crop rotation system.

Dominance-diversity architecture of a mixed hygromorphic-to-xeromorphic flora from a botanically rich locality in western equatorial Pangea (lower Permian Emily Irish site, Texas, USA	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Here we describe the Leonardian-age flora from "Emily Irish" (Russell Ranch), a small oxbow lake deposit, which is believed to be one of the most extensively collected, single-excavation floras of this age from any place in the world, including ca. 5200 hand specimens housed at the US National Museum of Natural History. The flora is dominated by a mixture of xeromorphic and meso-hygromorphic elements. The xeromorphs include conifers, taeniopterids, cordaitaleans, and noeggerathialeans. The mesomorphic-to-hygromorphic elements include marattialean tree ferns, sphenopsids, lycopsids, callipterids, and medullosan pteridosperms. This co-dominance of hygromorphic and xeromorphic elements is made especially conspicuous by the intimate co-mingling of plant remains from each group on the same hand specimens, and by the relative preservation-state of the macrofossils, which does not differ between the two groups. These observations suggest that they inhabited the same landscape immediately surrounding the depositional environment, and were likely only differentiated by micro habitat. We suggest that the Emily Irish flora grew under seasonally dry climate, but that areas adjacent to the lake and feeder streams retained sufficient moisture to support patches of taxa requiring consistently high soil moisture. These patches, thus, were embedded within a landscape of periodic moisture deficit that supported vegetation composed mostly of xeromorphic elements. This is more likely than requiring the xeromorphic taxa to be transported to the site from extrabasinal habitats, the nearest of which were hundreds of kilometers away at the time the deposit formed.

Seasonal Rainfall, Shrub Cover and Soil Properties Drive Production of Winter Annuals in the Northern Sonoran Desert	ECOSYSTEMS												Winter annual plants play an important role in arid and semiarid ecosystems because of their rapid response to resource pulses, which drive primary production that provides resources for herbivores and pollinators. Understanding the factors that control annual plant growth is key to predicting how arid and semiarid ecosystems will respond to changes in climate and resource availability from anthropogenic activities. We used a long-term nutrient enrichment experiment that spanned precipitation and urbanization gradients in central Arizona, USA, to examine the effects of climate, surface soil properties, soil nutrient availability and shrub cover on winter annual plant growth. At a landscape scale, aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of winter annual plants had a positive, nonlinear relationship to the amount of precipitation received from October through March of the current growing season. We found evidence for sequential resource limitation of ANPP initially from water then nitrogen and phosphorus. The resource limitation cascade was modified by surface soil properties and location relative to shrubs (under or between shrubs), highlighting the effect of small-scale factors on large-scale processes. Specifically, gravel cover had a negative effect on ANPP, and the effect of shrub cover on ANPP depended on nitrogen and current season rainfall. Our study emphasizes how small-scale factors, such as gravel cover, nutrient availability and presence of shrubs, can interact with large-scale drivers, such as seasonal precipitation, to affect interannual variation in winter annual plant production in the northern Sonoran Desert.					; Collins, Scott/P-7742-2014; Grimm, Nancy/D-2840-2009	Ohlert, Timothy/0000-0001-6976-5114; Shaw, Julea/0000-0001-6769-8114; Wheeler, Megan/0000-0001-5220-9648; Collins, Scott/0000-0002-0193-2892; Grimm, Nancy/0000-0001-9374-660X													1432-9840	1435-0629				2023 MAY 30	2023										10.1007/s10021-023-00850-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-023-00850-4		MAY 2023											WOS:000999622200001

It is also important for the theoretical calculation of driving resistance and design optimization of the undercarriage structure of hillside metal-tracked tractors (HMTs). The classic Bekker's pressure-sinkage model does not consider the influence of the soil water content, bulk density, slope angle, and other factors; therefore, it cannot be directly used to investigate the relationship between the soil compaction and its sinkage under sloped terrain conditions. To solve this problem, this study first verified that the soil water content and bulk density exert significant effects on the pressure-sinkage relationship under flat terrain condition. Secondly, a pressure-sinkage test was carried out using the quadratic rotation orthogonal combination design method, and the soil water content, density, and slope angle were considered. The pressure-sinkage curves of sloped terrain soils from Yangling and Yangxian in Shaanxi Province, and Huining and Jingning in Gansu Province were obtained. Then the pressure-sinkage parameters (sinkage exponent, cohesive modulus, and frictional modulus) were calculated using the weighted least-squares method. Thirdly, the mathematical relationship between the parameters and the soil water content, bulk density, and slope angle was obtained. Then Bekker's model was modified to obtain the pressure-sinkage model of sloped terrain. Finally, the control variable method under slope angle of 10 degrees, soil water content of 10%, and bulk density of 2 mg.m(-3) were used to validate the model. The results revealed that the root-mean-square error between the calculated pressure value of the model and the measured value of the film pressure sensor was 1.614, 1.601, and 0.822, respectively. In the dynamic operation of a hillside tractor prototype, the calculated pressures between the supporting wheels were close to the measured values. It indicates that the modified soil pressure-sinkage model is more suitable for calculating the force at the bottom of the track between the supporting wheels. It can also provide an important theoretical basis for accurately calculating the pressure-sinkage parameters of sloped terrain soil. Additionally, this approach could provide theoretical and technical support for the rational arrangement of HMT undercarriages to reduce the soil sinkage and driving resistance.																				2077-0472				MAR	2021	11	3							243	10.3390/agriculture11030243	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11030243													WOS:000633162000001

However, main factors that regulate N2O emissions following urea and organic matter amendments have yet to be clarified. Materials and methods To investigate the influence of different fertilization management measures on N2O emissions in tea garden soil, a 50-day laboratory incubation experiment was conducted. Five treatments were designed for this experiment: control (CK), urea (U), rapeseed cake (R), urea + rapeseed cake (2:1, UR1), and urea + rapeseed cake (1:2, UR2). Results and discussion N2O emission flux in the R treatment peaked at 14.12 mu g kg(-1) h(-1) on day 19, which occurred later than the UR1, UR2, and U treatments. Cumulative N2O emissions from the R and UR2 treatments were 6073 and 4296 mu g kg(-1), respectively, which were greater by a factor of 11.2 and 7.9, respectively, compared to the U treatment. Moreover, N2O emissions of the UR1 and UR2 treatments were significantly lower than the R treatment. Additionally, N2O emissions were also significantly positively correlated to pH levels and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) content. MBC content had the most direct and greatest influence on soil N2O emissions, indicating that MBC could be the key limiting factor for N2O emissions in this experiment. Conclusions A single application of rapeseed cake caused an increase in N2O emissions, whereas the combined application of rapeseed cake and a synthetic N fertilizer (urea) caused a decrease in N2O emissions. Results from this study offer potential strategies to mitigate soil N2O emissions from tea garden agroecosystems through improved field fertilization management.

However, severe soil desiccation is likely to occur if vegetation types and local precipitation conditions are not accounted for. In this study, an abandoned farmland and three typical vegetation types, including a natural shrubland, a plantation of black locust, and a natural oak secondary forest, were investigated to determine the characteristics of soil moisture in different hydrological years. The responses of soil moisture to precipitation were analysed at different timescales. Higher soil water contents were observed either in wet years or for natural vegetation types. The temporal response of soil moisture to precipitation was largely dependent on the timescale. At monthly scale, shallow soil moisture (0-100 cm) varied consistently with precipitation, whereas on interannual scale, precipitation is positively related to soil moisture along the whole profiles. Black locust and oak lands consumed more soil moisture than the shrubland, and severe soil desiccation developed in deep soil layers in the black locust plantation. The shrubland showed steeper regression slopes than other types for both the changes in soil water storage over time (Delta SWSt) versus the growing season precipitation and the difference in soil water storage with the abandoned farmland (Delta SWSv) versus the growing season precipitation, suggesting its higher adaptability to precipitation changes in this region. The results indicate that the shrubland develops optimal water use strategies through coevolution with local conditions and should be given precedence in vegetation restoration initiatives in this region.

Rate of Nitrogen Rather Than Timing of Application Influence Yield and NUE of Canola in South Australian Mediterranean Environments	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Canola has a high nitrogen requirement and optimal nitrogen (N) management in environments with variable rainfall is a challenge. This study investigated the impact of timing of N as a single or split application at different growth stages on seed yield, N uptake and water-use efficiency in canola. Nitrogen rates of 100 and 200 kg ha(-1) were applied after sowing when two leaves were unfolded or equally split between the rosette, green bud and first flower stages. The experiments were conducted at two sites with contrasting rainfall and a supplementary irrigation treatment at the low rainfall site, generating a third environment. Nitrogen application increased seed yield by up to 20% at a high rainfall site and by up to 77% at a medium rainfall site, but the timing of N did not significantly affect the yield response to N. Seed yield was closely associated with total dry matter production and seed m(-2). N-use efficiency was influenced more by N recovery and uptake efficiency, rather than physiological efficiency, which highlights the importance of soil moisture availability and the ability of the crop to exploit soil water and N reserves. The results suggest that better use of subsoil moisture by overcoming some of the subsoil constraints may be an avenue for further improvements in yield and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) of canola in this environment.

To shed light on the effects of different fertilizer management modes on maize growth, as well as rhizosphere bacterial populations and metabolites, we employed high-throughput sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics technology. Experimental treatments comprised: CK (no fertilizer), CF (single chemical fertilizer, N-P2O5-K2O), OF30 (30 % organic fertilizer replacement), OF70 (70 % organic fertilizer replacement), and OF100 (100 % organic fertilizer, animal manure and humic acid as raw materials). Compared to the single chemical fertilizer, the dual fertilizer management resulted in a more stable bacterial network and a more complex metabolic system. Notably, under OF70 conditions, the rhizosphere soil exhibited greater prevalence of functional bacteria like Paenibacillus and Pseudoxanthomonas. This stimulation significantly activated biosynthesis processes like unsaturated fatty acids, plant hormone synthesis, and plant secondary metabolite production. Through correlation mining of differential metabolites and differential bacteria, as well as weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we revealed a consistent correlation trend between bacterial population abundance and changes in metabolite content under dual fertilization. The dual fertilizer approach established a more intricate regulatory relationship between plants, bacteria and metabolites, indicative of a more stable rhizosphere environment. Importantly, our findings on the superior growth performance of maize under OF70 conditions, coupled with microecological changes in the rhizosphere (bacteria and metabolites), provide valuable insights for advancing efficient maize cultivation and informing scientifically sound fertilizer management practices. Moreover, these results hold relevance for production considerations in other agricultural crops. However, it is crucial to further explore the generalizability of these findings in field conditions.

J	Li, P; Zhang, KD; Wang, JW; Meng, H				Li, Pu; Zhang, Kuandi; Wang, Jingwen; Meng, He			Nondimensional sediment transport capacity of sand soils and its response to parameter in the Loess Plateau of China	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Soil erosion is a major contributor to land degradation in the Loess Plateau in China. To clarify the sediment transport capacity of overland flow influenced by hydraulic parameters, such as shear stress, sand shear stress (hydraulic gradient partition method and hydraulic radius partition method), mean flow velocity, Froude number, stream power, and unit stream power, indoor experiments with eight-unit-width flow discharges from 0.0667 x 10(-3) to 0.3333 x 10(-3) m(2)center dot s(-1), six slope gradients from 3.49 to 20.79%, and two kinds of sand soils (d(50) = 0.17 and 0.53 mm) were systematically investigated. A nondimensional method was adopted in data processing. Results showed that there was a partition phenomenon of relation curves because of the different median grain diameters. The correlation between the nondimensional stream power and nondimensional sediment transport capacity was the highest, followed by the correlation between the nondimensional unit stream power and nondimensional sediment transport capacity. However, there was a poor correlation between the flow intensity indices of velocity category and nondimensional sediment transport capacity. Nondimensional stream power, nondimensional unit stream power, and nondimensional shear stress could predict sediment transport capacity well. Ignoring the partition phenomenon of the relation curves, stream power could be used to predict sediment transport capacity, with a coefficient of determination of .85. Furthermore, a general flow intensity index was obtained to predict sediment transport capacity of overland flow. Finally, an empirical formula for predicting sediment transport capacity with a coefficient of determination of .90 was established by multiple regression analyses based on the general flow intensity index. During the analysis between measured sediment transport capacities in present study and predicted values based on Zhang model, Mahmoodabadi model, and Wu model, it was found that these three models could not accurately predict sediment transport capacities of this study because different models are estimated on the basis of different experimental conditions.					wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022; wang, jing/HJA-5384-2022; wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; wang, jie/HTQ-4920-2023; wang, dan/JEF-0836-2023	Zhang, Kuandi/0000-0002-1745-8435													0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN 30	2020	34	3					823	835		10.1002/hyp.13634	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13634		NOV 2019											WOS:000496567500001

In Tunisia, pea cultivation is characterized by its instability, especially in the arid region of Southern Tunisia. We carried out an investigation of the agro-morphological and genetic diversity of 12 local pea accessions cultivated in the arid region. We analyzed 21 qualitative and 26 quantitative traits following the UPOV descriptors. Furthermore, 8 SSRs were employed to examine genetic polymorphism, differentiation, and population structure. Molecular and agro-morphological data distinguished all the accessions under investigation. A considerable phenotypic diversity among accessions was observed for many characters, including some related to agronomical performance. At the molecular level, all the SSRs were polymorphic, with an average of 0.44 PIC value per locus. Our work indicated the presence of a wide-ranging variation among the local pea accessions evaluated. The overall results indicated that the agro-morphological traits and SSR markers were reliable and effective for assessing the genetic diversity of phenotypic pea accessions.

However, whether species of different plant functional groups showing distinct or similar acclimation justifies the simple prediction of respiratory carbon (C) loss to a warming climate. In this study, leaf dark respiration (R-d) of illinois bundleflower (IB, legume), stiff goldenrod (GR, C-3 forbs), indian grass, little bluestem and king ranch bluestem (IG, LB and KB, C-4 grass) were measured with detached leaves sampled in a 17-year warming experiment. The results showed that R-d at 20C and 22C (R-20 and R-22) were significantly lower in the warming treatment for all the five species. Lower R-22 in warmed than R-20 in control in GR, KB, LB and IG imply acclimation homeostasis, but not in IB. The significant decline in temperature sensitivity of respiration (Q(10)) of GR resulted in the marginal reduction of Q(10) across species. No significant changes in Q(10) of C-4 grasses suggest different acclimation types for C-3 forbs and C-4 grass. The magnitude of acclimation positively correlated with leaf C/N. Our results suggest that non-legume species had a relative high acclimation, although the acclimation type was different between C-3 forbs and C-4 grasses, and the legume species displayed no acclimation in R-d. Thus, the plant functional types should be taken into account in the grassland ecosystem C models.

The objective of this study was to investigate the physical and hydraulic properties of soils in commercial cotton fields managed as no-till systems following repeated applications of biochar generated as a waste of a papermill plant. Undisturbed cores and disturbed soil samples were collected from 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers from five commercial no-till fields in Mississippi, USA that received 6.7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) biochar for 0, 2, 3, 5 or 10 years. A number of physical, hydraulic, and chemical properties of these samples were measured in the lab. The results showed that biochar reduced the degree of soil compactness and increased soil aggregation and structural stability index. The findings were particularly apparent for the 10 years of consecutive application, which increased soil aggregate stability by up to 67%, reduced bulk density from 1.40 to 1.26 g cm(-3), and reduced degree of compactness from 73.2% to 62.8%. Biochar increased soil porosity but much of this increase (55%) occurred for small pores (< 0.5 mu m) with little effect on storage pores (0.5-50 mu m) or transmission pores (> 50 mu m). Consequently, biochar increased soil field capacity by up to 26%, but PAW increased by only 17%. Biochar significantly increased soil physical quality index score in the 0-5 cm layer from 0.16 to 0.26 and the increase was positively correlated with the number of years of application. The results suggest biochar generated as a byproduct of papermill could be land-applied in real-world crop production systems to improve soil health as an alternative to disposal in landfills.

Although well-managed commercial farms offer little manoeuvring space for increasing agricultural water productivity, smallholder farms usually operate at low input costs and therefore provide ample opportunities to reduce the potential yield gap through agricultural intensification. The aim of this paper is to analyse and compare yields and water productivities obtained in field and modelling experiments in Ethiopia (maize, garlic, onion), South Africa (tomato) and Tunisia (tomato, potato, wheat). Innovative agricultural practices were introduced on smallholder farms: irrigation scheduling and NPS Zn fertilization in Ethiopia; high-yielding cultivar, drip irrigation, mulching and organic amendments in South Africa; and crop water modelling in Tunisia. In general, crop yields increased up to eight times with innovative practices compared to current conventional farming practices. Crop water productivities were fairly stable within the same experiments, but increased with innovations, indicating that intensive farming can be more environmentally sustainable than conventional farming. Intensive farming systems in a resource-rich environment (high radiation levels, relatively fertile, deep and well-drained soils), combined with technology transfer and capacity building could be seen as viable strategies to secure food for smallholders and communities in African rural areas, as well as to improve water utilization in water-scarce catchments.

Pollinator declines and the stability of plant-pollinator networks	ECOSPHERE												Population declines of pollinators constitute a major concern for the fate of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in a context of global change. Massive declines of pollinator populations driven by habitat loss, pollution, and climate change have been reported, whose consequences at community and ecosystem levels remain elusive. We conducted a mathematical modeling and computer simulation study to assess the dynamic consequences of pollinator declines for the biodiversity of plants and pollinators. Specifically, we evaluated the effects of increased mortality and decreased carrying capacity of specialist vs. generalist and effective vs. ineffective pollinators visiting specialist vs. generalist plants on long-term community biomass and species persistence. Our results reveal that increased larval mortality and increased competition for space among larvae had the greatest impacts on the decline of pollinator diversity. In contrast, the largest sustained decreases in pollinator biomass were driven by increased adult mortality in spite of a small increase in pollinator species persistence. Decreased pollinator diversity led in turn to decreased plant diversity. Attacking pollinators with high degree and connected mostly to low-degree plants produced the greatest losses of plant diversity. Pollinator effectiveness had no noticeable effect on persistence. Our results illuminate our understanding of the consequences of pollinator declines for the maintenance of biodiversity.

We found that released T. armigera were able to find and parasitize host eggs within pearl millet fields both on-station and in farmers' fields. On-station releases of T. armigera led to an average 4.86-fold increase in T. armigera parasitism compared to control fields, where no parasitoids were released. Likewise, on-farm releases of T. armigera led to up to 5.31-fold more egg parasitism by T. armigera in release fields than in control. Our results suggest the effectiveness of T. armigera and lays the groundwork for using T. armigera in augmentative biological control of H. albipunctella in the Sahel.

Improvement of three popular Indian groundnut varieties for foliar disease resistance and high oleic acid using SSR markers and SNP array in marker-assisted backcrossing	CROP JOURNAL												Foliar fungal diseases (rust and late leaf spot) incur large yield losses, in addition to the deterioration of fodder quality in groundnut worldwide. High oleic acid has emerged as a key market trait in groundnut, as it increases the shelf life of the produce/products in addition to providing health benefits to consumers. Marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) is the most successful approach to introgressing or pyramiding one or more traits using traitlinked markers. We used MABC to improve three popular Indian cultivars (GJG 9, GG 20, and GJGHPS 1) for foliar disease resistance (FDR) and high oleic acid content. A total of 22 BC3F4 and 30 BC2F4 introgression lines (Es) for FDR and 46 BC3F4 and 41 BC2F4 ILs for high oleic acid were developed. Recurrent parent genome analysis using the 58 K Axiom_Arachis array identified several lines showing upto 94% of genome recovery among second and third backcross progenies. Phenotyping of these ILs revealed FDR scores comparable to the resistant parent, GPBD 4, and ILs with high (similar to 80%) oleic acid in addition to high genome recovery. These ILs provide further opportunities for pyramiding FDR and high oleic acid in all three genetic backgrounds as well as for conducting multi-location yield trials for further evaluation and release for cultivation in target regions of India.

However. empirical data substantiating these effects are still scarce. Rainfall was presently simulated under controlled conditions to study the effects of biochar on erosion and runoff potential with sandy loam soil sampled from a field experiment 2 years after biochar amendment (2 kg m(-2)). The field experiment comprised four untreated and four biochar-treated plots that were amended with biochar produced from birchwood. In the laboratory, aggregate stability and organic carbon (OC) in topsoil (0-0.2 m) were analyzed. Soil loss and runoff were measured during a 3.5-h rainfall simulation using a round flume setup. Organic C was also determined in the eroded sediment, soil crust, and bulk soil of each flume after simulations. While runoff was not affected by treatment biochar-treated soils showed significantly lower soil loss rates compared with untreated soils. reducing the cumulative soil loss by 41%. This was attributed to the aggregating effects of OC from the biochar application and delayed crust formation. The reduced erosion of OC from biochar-treated soils also resulted in lower OC enrichment ratios in the sediment and thus less OC export than from untreated soils. The results illustrated that biochar application already in the short term (2 years) can lead to an improvement of soil aggregation, thereby enhancing aggregate stability and leading to a reduction in soil loss. However, extrapolation of these positive results must be done with caution because the scale of the flume limited the erosive forces acting on the soil. Before an extrapolation of the results, an upscaling of erosion tests to field scale is therefore required.

This study attempted to present a comprehensive investigation on the spatiotemporal variations of sediment yield in the Loess Plateau using continuous observed data at 46 hydrological stations during 1961-2016, and its responses to changes of precipitation, land use/cover and vegetation cover were analyzed by using the Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM). The results indicated that sediment yield reduced pro-nouncedly during 1961-2016 in the Loess Plateau, and 77.9% of this variation was explained by the combined effects of precipitation, land-use change, vegetation dynamics and runoff reduction. Indirect effects of precipitation, land-use change, and vegetation cover on sediment yield were 0.242, -0.528 and -0.630 (P < 0.05), respectively, and direct effect of runoff on sediment yield was 0.833 (P < 0.05). According to the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, the strongest positive correlation existed between annual sediment yield and runoff (r = 0.88, P < 0.05), followed by vegetation cover (r = -0.47, P < 0.05) and land-use change (i.e. forest land and grassland) suggesting their significant trapping effects on soil erosion. However, lower correlations were examined between sediment yield and precipitation indices (-0.140.34), and a relatively higher relationship was examined between sediment yield and heavy rainfall (P25) (r = 0.34). Overall, changes in runoff and land-use/vegetation cover well explained varia-tions in sediment yield in the Loess Plateau. The findings are expected to provide scientific and technical support for future soil and water conservation planning in the Loess Plateau, and are valuable for sus-tainable water resources and sediment load management in the Yellow River Basin.(c) 2022 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research.

Dispersal-based versus niche-based processes as drivers of flea species composition on small mammalian hosts: inferences from species occurrences at large and small scales	OECOLOGIA												Biological communities may be assembled by both niche-based and dispersal-based (= historic) processes with the relative importance of these processes in community assembly being scale- and context-dependent. To infer whether (a) niche-based or dispersal-based processes play the main role in the assembly of flea communities parasitic on small mammals and whether (b) the main processes of flea community assembly are scale-dependent, we applied a novel permutation-based algorithm (PER-SIMPER) and the dispersal-niche continuum index (DNCI), to data on the species incidence of fleas and their hosts at two spatial scales. At the larger (continental) scale, we analysed flea communities in four biogeographic realms across adjacent continental sections. At the smaller (local) scale, we considered flea communities across two main regions (lowlands and mountains) and seven habitat types within Slovakia. Our analyses demonstrated that species composition of fleas and their small mammalian hosts depended predominantly on historical processes (dispersal) at both scale. This was true for the majority of biogeographic realms at continental scale (except the Nearctic) and both regions at local scale. Nevertheless, strong niche-based assembly mechanism was found in the Nearctic assemblages. At local scale, the intensity of dispersal processes was weaker and niche-driven processes were stronger between habitats within a region than between mountain and lowland regions. We provide historical and ecological explanations for these patterns. We conclude that the assembly of compound flea communities is governed, to a great extent, by the dispersal processes acting on their hosts and, to a lesser extent, by the niche-based processes.

J	Liu, JH; Ma, FT; Degen, A; Sun, P				Liu, Junhao; Ma, Fengtao; Degen, Allan; Sun, Peng			The Effects of Zinc Supplementation on Growth, Diarrhea, Antioxidant Capacity, and Immune Function in Holstein Dairy Calves	ANIMALS												Simple Summary Diarrhea is the most common disease in dairy calves and occurs frequently during the first month of life. It affects animal welfare and causes substantial economic losses. Zinc (Zn) is an essential nutrient element that can reduce the incidence of diarrhea. This study was designed to examine the effects of supplementary Zn proteinate (ZnPro, an organic zinc source) and Zn oxide (ZnO, an inorganic zinc source) on growth performance, diarrhea, antioxidant capacity, immune function, and mineral element concentrations of dairy calves during the first 28 days of life. Both ZnPro and ZnO reduced the bouts of diarrhea and promoted the immune function of calves, but ZnPro improved the growth performance and antioxidant capacity to a greater extent than ZnO. It was concluded that ZnPro is a better zinc source to improve calf health and performance than ZnO. The current study examined the effects of supplementary zinc proteinate (ZnPro) and zinc oxide (ZnO) on growth performance, diarrhea, antioxidant capacity, immune function, and mineral element concentrations of calves aged 1 to 28 days. A total of twenty-four newborn calves were divided randomly into 3 groups (n = 8; 2 males and 6 females per group), and each received: 0 mg/d Zn (CON), 627 mg/d ZnPro (80 mg/d Zn; ZnPro group), and 101 mg/d ZnO (80 mg/d Zn; ZnO group). The calves received the additive in their milk during the first 28 days of life. Compared with the CON group: ZnPro and ZnO improved average daily gain (ADG) and decreased the feed:gain ratio (FGR) between days 1 and 14 (p < 0.05), while the ADG increased and FGR decreased only in the ZnPro group between days 1 and 28 (p < 0.05). The incidence of diarrhea decreased (p < 0.05) in the ZnPro and ZnO groups between days 15 and 28 as well as days 1 and 28, but decreased (p < 0.05) only in the ZnPro group between days 1 and 14. The serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration of the ZnPro and ZnO groups increased on days 14 and 28 (p < 0.05). ZnPro supplementation increased serum IgM concentration during the whole study, while ZnO enhanced serum IgM concentration only on day 14 (p < 0.05). In the ZnO group, the serum concentration of cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 increased on day 14, while that of IL-1 & beta; increased on day 28 (p < 0.05). In addition, ZnPro reduced the serum malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration on days 14 and 28 (p < 0.05). Both ZnPro and ZnO increased the serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and metallothionein (MT) on day 14 (p < 0.05). With zinc supplementation, plasma Zn concentration increased (p < 0.05) on days 14 and 28 of age. We concluded that supplementary ZnPro and ZnO reduced incidences of diarrhea and promoted the immune function, but ZnPro improved the growth performance and antioxidant capacity of Holstein dairy calves to a greater extent.

How such properties respond to intensities of erosion remain unclear, hindering the understanding of the mechanisms behind agroecosystem hydrological cycling. Herein, we investigated the variations in soil hydraulic and physical properties at different slope positions that subjected to various intensities of soil erosion (nonerosion, light erosion, moderate erosion, and heavy erosion) and deposition positions along a maize field in the agricultural region. The average erosion moduli were <200, 700, 1800 and 4200 t km-2 a-1 at the non-erosion, light erosion, moderate erosion, and heavy erosion sites, respectively. The measured soil properties included soil organic matter, bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), soil water content, capillary moisture capacity, field capacity, parameters of the soil water retention curve and water-stable aggregates. Our results showed that organic matter, Ks, soil water content, capillary moisture capacity, field capacity and most parameters of soil water retention curve (i.e., ?r, ?s and n) decreased, but bulk density increased with soil depth at the eroding and non-erosion sites. Soil erosion decreased organic matter, Ks, soil water content, capillary moisture capacity, field capacity and the ability of soils to retain water but increased soil bulk density. The proportions of aggregates were not affected by soil depth or its interaction with soil erosion, while soil erosion decreased microaggregates but increased macroaggregates. Overall, in this study, agricultural erosion resulted in the degradation of soil hydraulic and physical properties, which may increase the risk of the agricultural ecosystem to suffer drought.

Modeling land management effects on the size distribution of eroded sediment	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Land management that improves soil quality is known to increase the amount of water-stable soil aggregates, but many current soil erosion models do not consider land management effects when estimating the size distribution of eroded sediment. Our objective was to develop a method to improve eroded sediment size estimates in response to alternative land management practices using information available within the RUSLE2 model and its database. We conducted a literature search identifying 274 soil aggregate size distributions where soil clay and soil organic carbon were also reported. The median value and log-normal standard deviation were estimated for each distribution. Median value was found to be linearly related to soil clay fraction and quadratically related to soil carbon content. However, the 10% of samples with observed median aggregate sizes greater than 3 mm were all underestimated by the regression model. All these samples were collected from soils under land use described as grass, pasture, or forest. To then determine whether incorporating management impacts on size distribution could better fit field data than this simple approach based purely on clay and carbon, algorithms termed MAS (Model of Aggregated Sediment) were derived and applied with default values in the RUSLE2 soil erosion model to estimate a coarser sediment size distribution at the point of detachment for land management with increased biomass inputs and reduced tillage disturbances. The MAS estimates of macroaggregated sediment (> 0.212 mm) mirrored fragment size observations made over 10 yr when cropland was converted to prairie in the central U.S.A. Thus, MAS estimated dynamic land management effects on aggregation better than regression relationships based solely on soil clay and carbon contents. More aggregate and sediment size datasets that include historical land use information will be needed to fully assess the generality of the MAS algorithms and parameter estimates.

However, harsh climatic and poor soil conditions, such as barren lands or abandoned mines, pose a challenge to the survival and yield of Miscanthus feedstock on the marginal land. The selection from the interspecific hybrids of Miscanthus might combine high survival rates and high yield, which benefits energy crop development in multi-stressful environments. A total of 113 F-1 hybrids between Miscanthus sacchariflorus and M. lutarioriparius together with the parents were planted and evaluated for multiple morphological and physiological traits on the mine land of the Loess Plateau of China. The majority of hybrids had higher establishment rates than M. sacchariflorus while M. lutarioriparius failed to survive for the first winter. Nearly all hybrid genotypes outperformed M. lutarioriparius for yield-related traits including plant height, tiller number, tiller diameter, and leaf area. The average biomass of the hybrids was 20 times higher than that of surviving parent, M. sacchariflorus. Furthermore, the photosynthetic rates and water use efficiency of the hybrids were both significantly higher than those of the parents, which might be partly responsible for their higher yield. A total of 29 hybrids with outstanding traits related to yield and stress tolerance were identified as candidates. The study investigated for the first time the hybrids between local individuals of M. sacchariflorus and high-biomass M. lutarioriparius, suggesting that this could be an effective approach for high-yield energy crop development on vast of marginal lands.

Facile synthesis of activated biochar/BiVO<sub>4</sub> heterojunction photocatalyst to enhance visible light efficient degradation for dye and antibiotics: applications and mechanisms	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T												The applications of biochar in catalysis have become a research hotspot, but studies using activated biochar (ACB) and enhanced mechanisms are limited. To improve the photocatalytic performance of BiVO4, the nano-photocatalyst (ACB-BiVO4) was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction. Various characterization techniques were performed, and the adsorption-photodegradation of the organic pollutants rhodamine B (RhB), tetracycline (TC), norfloxacin (NOR), and chloramphenicol (CAP) under visible light were investigated. Meanwhile, the effects of loading ratios, initial concentrations, recycling tests, more enhancement strategies, actual wastewater treatment, and disinfection effects on photocatalysis of ACB-BiVO4 were comprehensively evaluated. The results confirmed that the tetragonal phase BiVO4 was successfully composited onto the support ACB forming heterojunction, which displayed the best performance at a mass ratio of 1:0.62. The degradation rate by ACB-BiVO4 reached 84.52% for RhB at a kinetic constant of 0.0133 min(-1), which was 5.78 times higher than pure BiVO4. ACB-BiVO4 completely removed RhB and TC from the investigated surface water and removed more than 73.50% of RhB and TC from industrial wastewater. ACB-BiVO4 had excellent disinfection effects on E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus with a sterilization rate of over 99% at 12 h center dot OH and holes were dominant active species and the enhancement mechanism is associated with the heterojunction. ACB-BiVO4 expanded the visible light (similar to 545 nm) absorption and reduced the band gap (2.26 eV), and effectively inhibited the photogenerated carriers recombination. The unique structure (defects) and surface properties (functional groups and environmentally persistent free radicals) of ACB were found to play a critical role. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

However, the variations in soil microbial resource limitation to changing precipitation regimes and edaphic factors remain poorly understood, particularly for a highly divergent soil organic C gradient along the transect from dry to wet areas. This study investigated soil microbial C and nutrient (P/N) limitations along a 3,000-km humidity gradient. The results revealed a downward unimodal-shaped relationship between the humidity index (HI) and soil microbial P/N limitation with a threshold of HI = 0.68 (corresponding mean annual precipitation ranged from 469 mm to 551 mm). Changes in microbial C limitation, and total- and available soil P contents along the humidity gradient further revealed the presence of this threshold. Soil microbial C limitation remained constant at a humidity level below HI = 0.68, and it increased above this threshold. Microbial P limitation decreased and N limitation increased as humidity increased to HI = 0.68. Above HI = 0.68, the microbial P limitation gradually elevated with an increase in humidity. We also found that humidity and soil nutrients are critical factors explaining the variations in microbial resource limitation, and soil nutrients control microbial resource limitation on either side of the HI = 0.68 threshold. These findings suggest that the acquisition of N and P by soil microorganisms stimulates the decomposition of soil organic matter, and future predictions of ecosystem C budgets should thus consider enzymatic processes.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564; Wu, Jianzhao/0000-0003-3124-1109; WANG, jie/0009-0004-1824-7244													0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2022	209		2						105849	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105849	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105849		NOV 2021											WOS:000720775600016

Although magnesium oxide catalyst does not have as strong of basic sites as calcium oxide catalyst, it is stable under ambient conditions. Furthermore, magnesium oxide catalyst activity is not sensitive to the water content of the reactants, which makes magnesium oxide catalyst possible for commercial purposes. In addition, the use of the non-magnetic catalyst could be facilely recovered by magnetic and reusable several times without a notable decrease in catalytic activity. In the present study, MgO/Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst was synthesized by precipitation method for biodiesel production. This nanocatalyst was characterized by different techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) to recognize functional groups, measurement magnetic characteristics by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), identification of the phase and crystalline structure of nanocatalysts using X-radiation (XRD) and a survey of morphology and surface properties by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then, the synthesized catalyst was utilized to synthesis biodiesel from the transesterification reaction of camelina seed oil with methyl alcohol. A high biodiesel efficiency (99 %) was obtained under optimized conditions using the central composite design (CCD) based on the response surface methodology (RSM). The optimization was carried out in two separate parts; the initial part focuses on the optimization of the variables affecting the catalytic performance and the second part includes optimizing the variables affecting the reaction conditions of biodiesel production. The biodiesel was examined by GCMass spectra and physicochemical characteristics such as viscosity and refractive index. The optimum performance was achieved over MgO/Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst at calcination time 2.29 h, calcination temperature 650 degrees C, 55.25 % w/w MgO to Fe2O3-SiO2 core shell magnetic nanocatalyst, methanol to oil molar ratio 12/1, the catalyst to oil weight ratio 4.9 % w/w, reaction temperature 70 degrees C and reaction time 4.1 h. Moreover, MgO/Fe2O3-SiO2 core-shell magnetic nanocatalyst could be removed facilely from the reaction system by a magnet and catalytic performance maintained for the four reused cycles. Based on the results, camelina seed oil could be utilized as a promising alternative biofuel for impressive, renewable and green production of biodiesel.

Characterizing the response of soil moisture to revegetation is important for the sustainability of water and plants on the Loess Plateau of China. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of 1,262 observations from 66 published studies to evaluate the effect of land use on the soil moisture of forest, shrubland, and grassland regions at a depth of 5 m in different ecological zones of the Loess Plateau. The results indicated that (a) Soil moisture content (SMC) decreased after land use conversion in all three ecological zones and was inconsistent among different soil layers. (b) Except for other grassland species, changes in the response size for soil moisture were not significant among any tree species, including Pinus tabuliformis, Robinia pseudoacacia, other forest species, Caragana korshinskii, other shrubland species, and Medicago sativa. (c) Soil moisture changes varied with different restoration types and ages. (d) The change in response to precipitation was not significant, whereas the change in response to temperature was significant. In addition, the responses of the initial soil moisture levels exhibited a negative correlation with revegetation. These results indicate that it is vital for scientific afforestation in the Loess Plateau to complement local climate conditions and soil properties.																			1085-3278	1099-145X				FEB 15	2019	30	3					290	299		10.1002/ldr.3223	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3223													WOS:000457471200005

Given the key role of alpine meadows in soil and water conservation, meadow changes that could lead to higher erosion are particularly worrisome. However, little is known about plant and soil characteristics related to erosion resistance change with increasing levels of shrub encroachment. To address this issue, we evaluated multiple plant and soil variables closely related to erosion resistance along a shrub encroachment gradient in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Plant variables were herbaceous density, richness, root biomass while soil variables included bulk density, moisture, temperature, compressive strength, and shear strength. These were measured at multiple plots at four treatments, including non-encroached hillside alpine meadow (control) and hillside alpine meadow with low (<30% shrub cover), moderate (30%-60% shrub cover), and high (>60% shrub cover) levels of shrub encroachment. Our results showed that shrub encroachment significantly decreased herbaceous plant density and herbaceous species richness of meadow communities and that this effect strengthened along the shrub encroachment gradient. Encroachment also reduced herbaceous root biomass by 40.6%, 59.4%, and 73.3% in low, moderate, and high levels of encroachment at the 0-10 cm soil depth. We also found that shrub encroachment decreased soil bulk density by 10.9%-21.8% and soil moisture by 3.7-13.5% at 0-10 cm soil. Most important, both compressive and shear strength of topsoil gradually decreased with increasing levels of encroachment, and were approximately twice as low on high encroached plots than nonencroached plots. Overall, our results indicate that shrub encroachment leads to sparse community density, fewer herbaceous roots, and topsoil looseness, ultimately decreasing the strength of hillside alpine meadows' soils. These findings emphasize the role of shrub encroachment in driving the increase of soil erosion risk in hillside alpine meadows under climate changes.

However, SIF-GPP relationships are mostly built by statistically relating top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF observations (SIFTOC) to eddy covariance flux-tower GPP estimates. We developed a process-based model, based on the mechanistic light response (MLR) model, to mechanistically link SIFTOC with the photosynthetic activity of vegetation. To apply this mechanistic model at the canopy scale, we 1) reformulate the equations by replacing the fraction of open PSII reaction centers (q(L)) and the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi(Pmax)) with nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) and the quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi(P)); 2) reconstruct hemispherical broadband SIF fluxes at photosystem II (PSII) from the directional observed SIFTOC that is contributed from photosystem I and II; 3) estimate other key parameters including KDF (ratio between the rate constants for constitutive heat loss and fluorescence), C-c (chloroplastic CO2 partial pressure), and Gamma* (chloroplastic compensation point of CO2) at the canopy scale based on assumptions and in-situ measurements. A comparison against flux-tower based GPP at a winter-wheat study site, demonstrates that the modeled GPP, driven by SIFTOC at 760 nm, air temperature, incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and directional reflectance in the red and near-infrared region, is able to quantify canopy photosynthesis with good accuracy at both half-hourly (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE = 5.62 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), rRMSE = 9.10%) and daily (R-2 > 0.90, RMSE = 3.25 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and rRMSE = 8.69%) scales. The present model enhances our ability to mechanistically estimate GPP with SIF at the canopy scale, an essential step to model carbon uptake using satellite SIF at regional and global scales.

These films were analyzed using Raman, XPS, XRD, and AFM. Subsequently, the mechanical property, thermal stability, water contact angle, water vapor permeability (WVP), and electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption of the GnPs/ER composite films as well as their photothermal conversion effects on soil temperature were also extensively investigated. Incorporation of GnPs effectively improved the thermal stability and tensile strength of the films and decreased the WVP. More importantly, the GnPs/ER composite films exhibited excellent photothermal performance for enhancing soil temperature. Especially, the 8 wt% GnPs/ER composite film with the highest photothermal conversion efficiency (40.3%) is increased by 5 times compared with that of the PE film (6.7%) when the temperature of soil surface is 27 degrees C. It demonstrates that combination of GnPs and ER is a promising strategy to promote the photothermal conversion capability and barrier property for the composite films.

In this study, a total of 63 Iranian bread wheat were used to evaluate allelic variation at loci encoding LMW-GS using SDS-PAGE and their gene-specific PCR primers, and allele-trait association analysis. Eight types of alleles were detected at the Glu-A3 locus by two primer pairs, in which Glu-A3c (31%) had the most frequent allele. Three specific primers detected 17 alleles at Glu-B3 locus, the high frequency of which belongs to Glu-B3f with 14.5%. For Glu-D3 locus; in total, 22 alleles were identified by four specific primers and Glu-D3h allele was the most frequent. 5, 9 and 9 alleles were identified by SDS-PAGE technique at the Glu-A3, Glu-B3 and Glu-D3 loci, respectively, the most frequent of which belongs to Glu-A3c with 40%. Using Nei's genetic variation index (H), the allelic variation for Glu-A3, Glu-B3 and Glu-D3 loci, were estimated as 0.818, 0.914, and 0.910, respectively. The mean allelic variation (H) for Glu-3 loci was 0.894 among the genotypes. The results of allele-trait associations demonstrated that Glu-A3a and Glu-A3e were associated with high volume of SDS-sediment. The Glu-B3b, Glu-B3f, Glu-B3d and Glu-B3a were associated with high protein content, wet and dry gluten, and bread volume as well as hectoliter weight. Moreover, Glu-D3r was correlated to kernel hardness. The identified allelic variation and associated alleles with quality traits provided helpful information for marker-assisted breeding programs to improve bread-making quality.

Many current challenges can be eased by implementing Conservation Agriculture (CA), with however unknown financial consequences under the predominating irrigated conditions. We applied the linear programming to compare costs and benefits of four CA production systems, which are cotton-based rotation systems including (i) cotton-cotton and (ii) cotton-wheat-maize rotations under conventional tillage (CT), as well as (iii) cotton-cover crop-cotton, and (iv) cotton-wheat-maize rotations with mulch cover (crop residue retaining) and both rotations under permanent-bed planting (PB) with minimum tillage. All systems were subjected to six levels of land quality and a series of crop pricing schemes. Data were extracted from empirical research on CA in Uzbekistan, complemented with data on input and output prices from surveys. The findings underpinned the financial advantages of more diversified cropping systems (cotton-wheat-maize) over the crop monoculture (cotton-cotton-based system). Crop cultivation on marginal land was unprofitable under CT. In contrast, crop production under PB could generate profits even on croplands with a lower productivity level considered. It is argued that PB with crop residue retaining and applied in cotton-wheat-maize rotation shows most promise for improving crop yields and income.

However, current knowledge on the influence of microbial communities on the chemical compositions of different SOM fractions in estuarine land uses still remains incomplete. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-Vis absorption, and fluorescence spectroscopy to investigate soil microbial communities and characterize the chemical compositions of bulk SOM and water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) across different land uses (artificial forests (AF), farmland (FL), natural wetland (NW), construction land (CL), and abandoned land (AL)) in the Pearl River Estuary. The results showed that the bulk SOM in FL and AL exhibited comparable or higher levels of aromatic functional groups (aromatic C-H and aromatic C=C) compared to other land uses. The HIX and SUV254 indexes further confirmed that AF and FL had more aromatic and hydrophobic WEOM. Apart from FL, where anthropogenic humus constituted the largest proportion, the WEOM fraction predominantly consist of three components in the following order across all land uses, ordered as anthropogenic humus < microbial humus < protein humus. The chemical compositions of the different SOM fractions showed a stronger correlation with the dominant bacterial phylum composition, especially for the WEOM fraction, compared to the fungal composition. Meanwhile, our findings demonstrate that bacterial diversity showed a stronger relationship with the chemical composition of WEOM compared to abundance. Overall, this study sheds light on the impact of land use on the quantity and quality of SOM fractions, underscoring the varying influence of microorganisms on the chemical compositions of different SOM fractions within estuarine environments.																			0929-1393	1873-0272				JAN	2024	193								105126	10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.105126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.105126		SEP 2023											WOS:001074969200001

Although microbes are known to play an important role in biogeochemical cycles, the mechanisms how soil microbes drive nutrient cycling remain elusive under N deposition. Therefore, we investigated changes in microbial community diversity, composition, and interactions, and elucidated the relationship among microbial community responses, soil available nutrients, and ecological stoichiometry resulting from two years of N addition to a Pinus tabuliformis plantation on the Loess Plateau at four rates of N addition (0 (N0), 3.0 (N3), 6.0 (N6), and 9.0 (N9) g N m(-2) y(-1)). N addition significantly influenced microbial composition, decreasing the relative abundance of Acidobacteria and Basidiomycota along N addition gradients and increasing the relative abundance of Ascomycota from N3 to N9. Along N addition gradients except N3, bacterial interactions increased from 62.70% to 73.38%, whereas interactions between bacterial and fungal communities decreased from 34.44% to 24.43%. Among all microbial interactions, the positive ones accounted for a larger proportion (over 55%), indicating a predominance of mutualism under all N addition treatments. Changes in the microbial composition were correlated with soil resource stoichiometry factors, including soil organic carbon: soil total N (SOC:TN) and SOC: soil total phosphorus (SOC:TP), whereas the topological network features were correlated with ammonium N (NH4+-N), nitrate N (NO3--N), beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), alkaline phosphatase (AP), and eco-enzymatic stoichiometry. Therefore, the soil variables that caused changes to microbial composition and interactions were different. In this sense, microbial community compositions were more easily affected by soil resource stoichiometry, whereas microbial interactions were more easily affected by soil available nutrients. In addition, changes to microbial interactions could mediate microbial metabolism via eco-enzyme expression.					zhang, Weihua/JJD-6447-2023	Yang, Xiaomei/0000-0002-5199-7889; Tang, Darrell/0000-0002-4743-3976													0929-1393	1873-0272				JUN	2022	174								104422	10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.104422	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.104422		FEB 2022											WOS:000772624000002

To understand the spatial-temporal variation, ecological risk and source of nutrients, and heavy metals in sediments from the Weihe River, the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), organic matter (OM), and 10 heavy metals (Cd, Sb, As, Co, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cr, Zn, and Mn) in sediments at 14 sampling sites along the river were investigated. The results showed that nutrients and heavy metals had an interannual decreasing trend, and that the high-value regions were concentrated in urban locations within the study area. Ecological risk assessment results showed that TN was between the security level (no toxic effect) and the lowest level (tolerable for organisms), TP was at the lowest level, and OM was within the security level, all mainly from external sources. The geoaccumulation index (I-geo) and enrichment factor (EF) of 10 heavy metals were all within the unpolluted level, while the pollution load index (PLI) of 12 sampling sites had reached the moderate pollution level. The results of Pearson correlation, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis showed that heavy metals originated mainly from industrial and domestic sources, geochemical environments, and agricultural activities, indicating that heavy metals in the Weihe River sediments were influenced significantly by anthropogenic activities. The results are expected to provide a scientific basis for the development and utilization of the Weihe River water resources.					Li, xuantian/IXM-9485-2023; Delang, Claudio O.

Yet, it is uncertain what effects of vegetation restoration have on autotrophic bacterial community and associated C-fixing potential. To investigate the responses of autotrophic bacterial community and microbial C-fixing rate to vegetation restoration of eroded agricultural land, three abandoned croplands (ES1, ES2 and ES3) and two secondary grasslands planted with Coronilla varia (GS1 and GS2) in the Qiaozi watershed of Chinese Loess Plateau were selected, and high-throughput sequencing and C-13 stable isotope labeling were applied in this study. Results showed that vegetation restoration significantly (P < 0.05) improved soil C and N contents while reduced soil moisture level. Total autotrophic bacterial abundance and species diversity in nutrient-rich secondary grasslands were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than those in nutrient-poor croplands. However, positive responses of obligate autotrophic bacteria, such as Alkalililimnicola and Synechococcus, to vegetation restoration were observed. Correlation analysis showed that autotrophic bacterial abundance and diversity were positively (P < 0.05) correlated with soil moisture, while negatively (P < 0.05) correlated with soil C and N nutrients. Microbial C-fixing rate ranged from 0.621 to 1.414 Mg C km(-2) y(-1) and the maximum value was observed in the ES3 site, followed by the ES1 site (1.088 Mg C km(-2) y(-1)). Microbial C-fixing rate in abandoned cropland was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that in secondary grassland, and it was positively influenced by autotrophic bacterial abundance and diversity. Overall, vegetation restoration of eroded agricultural land has negative impacts on autotrophic bacterial community and microbial C-fixing potential. In arid and semi-arid regions, great transpiration loss induced by vegetation restoration may inhibit autotrophic bacteria growth, and which further reduces the potential of CO2 fixation by autotrophic bacteria.

Walp. Inoculated with Rhizobia under Different Soil Water Regimes	WATER												Impact of soil water regimes on physiological responses and water use efficiency (WUE) for Vigna unguiculata L. Walp. (cowpea) inoculated with rhizobia still remains implicit. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to examine the leaf gas exchange, abscisic acid (ABA) and hydraulic signaling, WUE and carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions (delta C-13 and delta O-18) of cowpea under different soil water levels. The treatments included soil water regimes at three levels (90%, 70%, and 50% of soil water holding capacity (SWHC)) and two inoculation forms (inoculated and non-inoculated with rhizobia). The results showed that across the inoculation treatments, reduced soil water regimes depressed both stomatal conductance (g(s)) and photosynthesis (A(n)) of the leaves, nonetheless, the decrease of g(s) was more pronounced compared with the reduction in A(n). Consequently, the intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) was improved in the treatments under decreased soil water conditions. Plant WUE was also improved when soil water contents decreased as exemplified by the increased leaf delta C-13 and delta O-18, indicating the enhanced plant WUE was mainly attributed to the decrease of g(s). Significant interactions between soil water regimes and rhizobia treatments for root water potential (RWP), leaf water potential (LWP), and g(s) were found due to the different responses of rhizobia to varied soil water regimes. Inoculation could improve plant water status and g(s) under 70% and 90% SWHC compared to 50% SWHC with negative effect from rhizobia. A moderate soil water regime is suggested for cowpea production in terms of high WUE with a minor biomass reduction.

J	Qin, J; Shangguan, ZP; Xi, WM				Qin, Juan; Shangguan, Zhouping; Xi, Weimin			Seasonal variations of leaf traits and drought adaptation strategies of four common woody species in South Texas, USA	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH												Understanding physiological responses and drought adaptation strategies of woody plant leaf traits in sub-humid to semi-arid regions is of vital importance to understand the interplay between ecological processes and plant resource-allocation strategies of different tree species. Seasonal variations of leaf morphological traits, stoichiometric traits and their relationships of two drought tolerant woody species, live oak (Quercus virginiana) and honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and two less drought tolerant species, sugarberry (Celtis laevigata) and white ash (Fraxinus americana) were analyzed in a sub-humid to semi-arid area of south Texas, USA. Our findings demonstrate that for the two drought tolerant species, the leguminous P. glandulosa had the highest specific leaf area, leaf N, P, and lowest leaf area and dry mass, indicating that P. glandulosa adapts to an arid habitat by decreasing leaf area, thus reducing water loss, reflecting a resource acquisition strategy. While the evergreen species Q. virginiana exhibited higher leaf dry mass, leaf dry matter content, C content, C:N, C:P and N:P ratios, adapts to an arid habitat through increased leaf thickness and thus reduced water loss, reflecting a resource conservation strategy in south Texas. For the two less drought tolerant deciduous species, the variations of leaf traits in C. laevigata and F. americana varied between Q. virginiana and P. glandulosa, reflecting a trade-off between rapid plant growth and nutrient maintenance in a semi-arid environment.

BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Drought is one of the major constraints affecting the economic yield of maize worldwide. Present study was carried out to select the surrogates for drought resilience in 70 maize landraces collected from diverse agro-ecologies of Kashmir Himalayas. Significant variation was observed among the genotypes for all the traits under well-watered and drought conditions. Due to the drought stress, the highest reduction was observed for the canopy temperature (175.18%), followed by root volume (69.77%), top root biomass (69.1%), shoot biomass (67.2%), bottom root biomass (53.75%), chlorophyll content (22.85 SPAD units) and shoot height (21.63%). The reduction was also recorded for other traits like shoot to total biomass ratio (2.70%), relative water content (13.42 %), cell membrane stability (17.33%) and rooting depth (19.86%). Root to total biomass ratio was found to increase in response to drought stress (7.69%). A positive significant correlation was observed between grain yield and root volume, top root biomass, bottom root biomass, rooting depth, root to total biomass, chlorophyll content, cell membrane stability, canopy temperature depression and relative water content. These can be used for selection of appropriate surrogates of drought tolerant genotypes. The landraces viz., KD-L35, KD-L37, KD-L19, KD-L23, KD-L17, KD-L21, KD-L46, KD-L43, KD-L29, KD-L25 and KD-L38 showed promising performance under drought for most of the surrogates identified. The landraces selected can be used as sources of novel and/or favourable alleles to breed for climate resilient maize cultivars.

In this study, we collected soil samples from reclaimed mine sites (RMSs), which comprised sites revegetated with trees (Tr), bushes (Bu), or grasses (Gr), and from the adjacent undisturbed native sites (UNSs). We evaluated the effects of revegetation patterns on: (i) soil aggregate formation and (ii) the distributions of OC and TN in different aggregate size classes. In the 0- to 15-cm layer, the distribution of the aggregate sizes as well as the OC and TN concentrations in both the bulk soil and aggregate fractions did not differ significantly between the RMSs and UNSs. However, in the 15- to 30-cm layer, the macroaggregate (>0.25 mm) fractions were generally lower and the microaggregate (0.25-0.053 mm) fractions were generally higher in the RMSs than the UNSs. The OC and TN concentrations in both the bulk soil and aggregate fractions were lower in the RMSs than the UNSs. Among the RMS revegetation patterns, Gr had a significantly higher proportion of microaggre-gates and a significantly lower proportion of the <0.053-mm size classes than Tr in both layers. The OC and TN concentrations in both the bulk soil and aggregate fractions were significantly higher in Gr than Tr. There were no significant differences between Bu and Gr in terms of either the aggregate size distribution or the OC and TN concentrations. However, planting grasses may be a better choice considering the economic cost.

However, its usefulness in semi-humid regions with irrigation capabilities remains unclear. In addition, the optimal ridge-to-furrow ratios and nitrogen (N) application rates are unknown. In this study, we investigated five different planting patterns (i.e., rain-fed flat planting [CK], RFPFM practices with three different ridge-to-furrow ratios [20:40, RFPFM20; 30:30, RFPFM30; and 40:20, RFPFM40], and RFPFM plus supplemental irrigation [RFPFM + SI]) under two N application rates (75 and 225 kg.ha(-1)) in winter wheat over two years. RFPFM practices led to increased soil temperature in the ridges at the seedling stage and the retention of more water in the furrows throughout the two growing seasons. The improved hydrothermal characteristics of RFPFM plots led to early and stable seedling establishment, resulting in higher grain yields, water use efficiency (WUE), and net revenues. Grain yields were higher with RFPFM20, RFPFM30, RFPFM40, and RFPFM + SI practices than with CK by 28.3%, 37.2%, 55.6%, and 100.4%, respectively, averaged for both N rates over the two years. Additionally, WUE was higher by 22.6%, 28.3%, 40.5%, and 9.3%, respectively. Increased ridge-to-furrow ratios affected micro-topography, as evidenced by improvements in hydrothermal features, grain yields, WUE, and net revenues. Overall, we recommend RFPFM40, the widest ridge, as a promising water-saving and economical practice for winter wheat production in dry semi-humid areas. Supplemental irrigation could be considered in RFPFM practices to alleviate drought stress in dry years (< 150 nun precipitation) to increase grain yields, WUE, and net economic benefits. Technological advancements, such as innovative mechanization to reduce extensive labor costs, are required to boost the adoption of RFPFM practices, fully exploit its economic and social benefits, and prioritize environmental sustainability.

Its variation for some special soil conditions and easily erosive region was limitedly studied. This study dealt with the extent of Br- releasing from soil to surface runoff, the actual mixing depth and the calculated one on the unsaturated loess slope, and the influences of soil initial moistures. Materials and methods Br- was placed as a tracer at different soil depths in the loess slope with three soil initial moistures. Br- concentration in surface runoff and soil profiles was monitored under simulated rainfall condition. The actual mixing layer depth was determined by whether Br- in that layer could be detected in surface runoff during the whole rainfall process. The average effective depth of interaction (EDI) was calculated by the confirmation method reported before. Results and discussion The shallower the application depth, the higher the Br- concentration and loss risk in surface runoff. The net loss rate had an exponential decreasing correlation with the solute-applied depth. The depth of Br- peak content in soil profile after the rainfall ended increased with the application depth. Br- concentration in the surface soil was more than that in the runoff at the end of rainfall, which indicated an incomplete mixing between runoff water and soil water in the mixing layer. Under this experimental condition, the actual mixing layer depth for 3.5% soil moisture slope was about 3 cm, that for 10% soil moisture was 6 cm or so, and that for 20% soil moisture was more than 7 cm. The average EDI calculated for 3.5, 10, and 20% soil moisture was 2.31, 3.76 and 4.95 cm, respectively, which were less than the actual mixing layer depth and more than some former studies. Conclusions The traditional 1.0-cm mixing depth in many agricultural NPS models might not be so exact for some special region.																			1439-0108	1614-7480				JAN	2020	20	1					153	165		10.1007/s11368-019-02370-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-019-02370-y													WOS:000515824400015

Despite the interest in this topic and the plethora of recent studies in natural ecosystems, it has been seldom explored in croplands. Using two recently published independent datasets of soil microbial metabolic quotient (MMQ; microbial respiration rate per unit biomass) and carbon use efficiency (CUE; partitioning of C to microbial growth vs. respiration), we find a compensatory thermal adaptive response for MMQ in global croplands. That is, mean annual temperature (MAT) has a negative effect on MMQ. However, this compensatory thermal adaptation is only half or less of that found in previous studies for noncultivated ecosystems. In contrast to the negative MMQ-MAT pattern, microbial CUE increases with MAT across global croplands. By incorporating this positive CUE-MAT relationship (greater C partitioning into microbial growth rather than respiration with increasing temperature) into a microbial-explicit soil organic carbon model, we successfully predict the thermal compensation of MMQ observed in croplands. Our model-data integration and database cross-validation suggest that a warmer climate may select for microbial communities with higher CUE, providing a plausible mechanism for their compensatory metabolic response. By helping to identify appropriate representations of microbial physiological processes in soil biogeochemical models, our work will help build confidence in model projections of cropland C dynamics under a changing climate.

Here, we conducted field surveys along a shrub coverage gradient to examine the effects of shrub encroachment on the structure and functioning of alpine meadows' plant communities. Our results showed that the overall coverage, density, aboveground biomass, species richness, and diversity of meadow community gradually declined with increasing levels of shrub encroachment, especially when shrub coverage exceeded 60%. Aboveground ecosystem multifunctionality also decreased along the shrub coverage gradient. With 90% shrub coverage, the relative importance value of the forbs functional group significantly increased while the Cyperaceae functional group showed the opposite trend: the originally dominant sedges Carex moorcroftii and Kobresia myosuroides were replaced by the forbs Androsace umbellate and Polygonum sparsipilosum. Additionally, shrub encroachment had a strong effect on nonrandom herb species extinction and colonization. At shrub coverages higher than 60%, there were 9 herb species absent and 18 new species colonizing-7 of which were only observed in meadows with 90% shrub coverage. Rare species and those with lower stature were more likely to go extinct, while taller and shade-tolerant species tended to colonize areas with increasing shrub coverage. Overall, our results indicate that shrub encroachment negatively affects herbaceous community structure and functioning, which has important implications for the management of alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau under ongoing climate change.

Here, we investigated how R-S respond to N addition in a tropical montane rainforest in Southern China. Four levels of N treatments (0, 25, 50, and 100 kg N ha(-1) a(-1) as control (CK), low N (N25), moderate N (N50), and high N (N100), respectively) were established in September 2010. Based on a static chamber-gas chromatography method, R-S was measured from January 2015 to December 2018. R-S exhibited significant seasonal variability, with low R-S rates appeared in the dry season and high rates appeared in the wet season regardless of treatment. R-S was significantly related to the measured soil temperature and moisture. Our results showed that soil R-S increased after N additions, the mean annual R-S was 7% higher in N25 plots, 8% higher in N50 plots, and 11% higher in N100 plots than that in the CK plots. However, the overall impacts of N additions on R-S were statistically insignificant. For the entire study period, the CK, N25, N50, and N100 treatments yielded Q(10) values of 2.27, 3.45, 4.11, and 2.94, respectively. N addition increased the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of R-S. Our results suggest that increasing atmospheric N deposition may have a large impact on the stimulation of soil CO2 emissions from tropical rainforests in China.

To solve the main problems associated with a low adjustment range of the working speed, complex operation, and low safety for slope operation of medium-sized crawler tractors, a hydrostatic drive system that can be used for hillside crawler tractors was designed. According to the operation requirements of a hillside crawler tractor, the parameters of the three-cylinder diesel engine, hydrostatic transmission (HST), drive rear axle, and other key components of the drive system were matched after the force and motion analyses of the tractor, and then the main performance indicators, including the traction performance, system pressure and working speed of the drive system were verified. On this basis, a drive system performance test bench was built, and the traction performance and starting acceleration performance of the drive system was tested. The results of the traction bench test show that when the engine was at the maximum torque point of 1700 r/min, the maximum theoretical tractive force outputted by the tractor in Gear I was 114,563 N, and the maximum theoretical tractive force outputted by tractor in Gear II was 10,959.2 N, which were both larger than the traction resistance of 9550.6 N experienced by the hillside tractor ploughing on the slope. The results of the initial acceleration bench test show that the tractor driving speed can gradually increase with increasing output of the variable pump and can reach the maximum in 3 s. When the tractor was driving on flat ground, the maximum driving speeds of Gear I, Gear II, and Gear III were 4.65 km/h, 6.58 km/h, and 8.57 km/h, respectively, which are close to the theoretical values. When the tractor was driving on a 15 degrees slope, the maximum driving speeds of Gear I, Gear II, and Gear III were 4.55 km/h, 6.25 km/h, and 8.28 km/h, respectively. It can be concluded that the design matching of the drive system is reasonable, the speed consistency is good and there is enough power reserve, which can meet the requirements for a large workload.

Foliar Spray of Micronutrients Alleviates Heat and Moisture Stress in Lentil (<i>Lens culinaris</i> Medik) Grown Under Rainfed Field Conditions	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												The simultaneous occurrence of high temperature and moisture stress during the reproductive stage of lentil (Lens culinaris Medik) constrains yield potential by disrupting the plant defense system. We studied the detrimental outcomes of heat and moisture stress on rainfed lentils under residual moisture in a field experiment conducted on clay loam soil (Aeric Haplaquept) in eastern India from 2018 to 2019 and from 2019 to 2020 in winter seasons. Lentil was sown on two dates (November and December) to expose the later sowing to higher temperatures and moisture stress. Foliar sprays of boron (0.2% B), zinc (0.5% Zn), and iron (0.5% Fe) were applied individually or in combination at the pre-flowering and pod development stages. High temperatures increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content due to membrane degradation and reduced leaf chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water potential, and yield (kg ha(-1)). The nutrient treatments affected the growth and physiology of stressed lentil plants. The B+Fe treatment outperformed the other nutrient treatments for both sowing dates, increasing peroxidase (POX) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities, chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, relative leaf water content (RLWC), seed filling duration, seed growth rate, and yield per hectare. The B+Fe treatment increased seed yield by 35-38% in late-sown lentils (December). In addition, the micronutrient treatments positively impacted physiological responses under heat and moisture stress with B+Fe and B+Fe+Zn alleviating heat and moisture stress-induced perturbations. Moreover, the exogenous nutrients helped in improving physiochemical attributes, such as chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water potential, seed filling duration, and seed growth rate.

Although the processes of runoff and sediment detachment and transport are well recognized, the effects of vegetation restoration on organic C loss through soil erosion are not fully understood within a given landscape. This study conducted a synthesis from 66 sites to evaluate the effects of vegetation restoration on annual C loss induced by soil erosion across the key areas of the 'Grain for Green' Program (GGP) in the Loess Plateau, China. The results showed that vegetation restoration has significantly reduced the annual C loss in sediment and from runoff. Since 2000, a total of 8.6 x 10(6) ha degraded land has been converted to forests, shrubs and grasslands under the GGP, which has reduced runoff by 1.5 x 10(9) m(3) and is associated with 7.3 x 10(3) Mg C; furthermore, lost sediment has reduced by 348.7 Tg, which is associated with 1.8 Tg C per year, across the Loess Plateau. In the zone with a mean annual precipitation (MAP) < 550 mm, the degraded lands that have been converted to grasslands and shrubs have reduced more soil and water losses than have the lands that have been converted to forests; additionally, in the zone with a MAP > 550 mm, the degraded lands that have been converted to forests have less soil erosion than do the lands that have been converted to grasslands and shrubs. Moreover, C loss induced by soil erosion was mainly affected by plant cover, soil porosity, slope, land-use change, and rainfall intensity on the Loess Plateau. This study suggests that optimal vegetation restoration measures should be adopted based on local conditions to reduce C loss induced by soil erosion.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Huang, Chunbo/0000-0001-6222-215X; Kim, Dong-Gill/0000-0003-3084-2658													0921-8181	1872-6364				JUN	2019	177						101	115		10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.03.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.03.017													WOS:000468717000009

Dynamic molecular tunnel junctions based on self-assembled monolayers for high tunneling current triboelectricity generation	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A												Efficient conversion of mechanical energy into electric energy with sufficient d.c. current density has great potential for supplying power to electronics. However, conventional triboelectric nanogenerators still face critical challenges mainly due to the high impedance of the polymer-based systems and external rectification. Here, a novel dynamic metal-insulator-metal generator (DMIMG) with a maximum current density of about 7.6 x 10(6) A m(-2) was created by moving a conductive atomic force microscope tip on a formed molecular junction, which is based on triboelectricity and molecular tunneling processes. Finite element simulation and systematic experiments show that a high-density d.c. tunneling current was generated when the non-equilibrium carrier was tribo-excited to move through the molecular monolayer on its own. This proof of concept can also be applied to tunneling current imaging and scaled-up macroscopic energy conversion. This innovative idea may be used to investigate new possibilities for novel materials and device configurations for green energy harvesting methods.

The Chinese Loess Plateau is one of the most eroded areas in the world. However, there has been limited assessment of historic spatial changes in erosion rates on the Loess Plateau and the major contributors driving these spatial changes. In this study, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation was empirically validated and employed to assess spatially distributed historical erosion rates on the Loess Plateau from 1901 to 2016. A double mass curve attribution technique was then used to investigate the impact of land management and climatic drivers on the Loess Plateau. Decadal average erosion rates and the total area with intensive erosion (>5000 t km(-2) yr(-1)) experienced a sharp increase from the 1930s to 1970s, followed by a decline to an historic low between the 1980s and 2000s. Mean erosion rates for the 2000s were 54.3% less than those of the 1970s. However, a recent increase in erosion rates was observed between 2010 and 2016. Land management change was the dominant driver of historical erosion rate changes before 2010. Extensive deforestation and farming, driven by population increase, were responsible for intensifying erosion between the 1930s and 1970s, while policy-driven conservation schemes and revegetation led to reduction thereafter. However, the recent increase in erosion between 2010 and 2016 was mainly driven by extreme rainfall events, a major concern given climate change projections. Advanced erosion control strategies are therefore required as part of integrated catchment management that both maintain water supplies for human use during dry periods while reducing erosion during storm events.

However, studies for accurately assessing the ecological benefits of different vegetation restoration models are relatively limited. In this study, we examined the vertical distribution of soil nutrient contents and its influencing factors beneath five typical artificial vegetation types (i.e., Populus simonii, Pinus tabuliformis, Caragana korshinskii, Medicago saliva, and Stipa bungeana) in a transition zone from desert to loess in North China. We found that soil nutrient content had a distinct hierarchy and decreased with increasing soil depth, thereby reflecting the surface aggregation effect of vegetation on soil nutrients. The soil quality index (SQI) and soil nutrients showed the same vertical distribution trend. The average SQI of different vegetation types followed the order: M. sativa (0.2052) > S. bungeana (0.1917) > P. tabuliformis (0.1761) > C. korshinskii (0.1473) > P. simonii (0.0883). Comprehensive analysis showed that the artificial restoration of S. bungeana vegetation was the most suitable restoration type in this catchment. Soil nutrient content was positively correlated with soil water content, plant coverage, clay, silt, and litter nutrient content but negatively correlated with soil bulk density, sand, and litter C/N. Our research is helpful in scientifically evaluating the ecological effect and service value of "Grain-for-Green" program and providing a reference for the implementation of a new round of "Grain-for-Green" in the desert-loess transition zone.

M.; Chen, Yinglong			Arbuscular Mycorrhizas Regulate Photosynthetic Capacity and Antioxidant Defense Systems to Mediate Salt Tolerance in Maize	PLANTS-BASEL												Salt stress inhibits photosynthetic process and triggers excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study examined the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) association in regulating photosynthetic capacity and antioxidant activity in leaves of two maize genotypes (salt-tolerant JD52 and salt-sensitive FSY1) exposed to salt stress (100 mM NaCl) in soils for 21 days. The leaf water content, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic capacity in non-mycorrhizal (NM) plants were decreased by salt stress, especially in FSY1, with less reduction in AM plants than NM plants. Salinity increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR)) in both genotypes regardless of AM inoculation, but decreased the contents of non-enzymatic antioxidants (reduced glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (AsA)), especially in FSY1, with less decrease in AM plants than NM plants. The AM plants, especially JD52, maintained higher photosynthetic capacity, CO2 fixation efficiency, and ability to preserve membrane integrity than NM plants under salt stress, as also indicated by the higher antioxidant contents and lower malondialdehyde (MDA)/electrolyte leakage in leaves. To conclude, the higher salt tolerance in AM plants correlates with the alleviation of salinity-induced oxidative stress and membrane damage, and the better performance of photosynthesis could have also contributed to this effect through reduced ROS formation. The greater improvements in photosynthetic processes and antioxidant defense systems by AM fungi in FSY1 than JD52 under salinity demonstrate genotypic variation in antioxidant defenses for mycorrhizal amelioration of salt stress.

Seeds tend to disperse further in the tropics	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Despite the importance of seed dispersal in a plant's life cycle, global patterns in seed dispersal distance have seldom been studied. This paper presents the first geographically and taxonomically broad quantification of the latitudinal gradient in seed dispersal distance. Although there is substantial variation in the seed dispersal distances of different species at a given latitude, seeds disperse on average more than an order of magnitude further at the equator than towards the poles. This pattern is partially explained by plant life-history traits that simultaneously associate with seed dispersal distance and latitude, including dispersal mode and plant height. The extended seed shadow of tropical plants could increase the distance between conspecific individuals. This could facilitate species coexistence and contribute to the maintenance of high plant diversity in tropical communities. The latitudinal gradient in dispersal distance also has implications for species' persistence in the face of habitat fragmentation and climate change.

Application of biochar under deficit irrigation can enhance seedling growth in arid regions. The growth of commercial woody species seedlings was monitored for approximately two years using the combined effect of biochar and deficit irrigation treatments. Biochar was applied to the plantation pits during plantation at a rate of 38 g kg-1 of soil. The applied deficit irrigation per season covered 60% (459 mm) and 35% (459 mm) of the dry season crop evapotranspiration for Citrus sinensis and Yushinia alpina, respectively. We found statistically clear effects of biochar and deficit irrigation on the growth of both species with combined application. Compared to control treatment, the combined application of biochar and deficit irrigation significantly (P < 0.05) increased new culms of Y. alpina by 44%. Moreover, the combined application of biochar and deficit irrigation significantly (P < 0.05) affected the height and diameter relative growth rates (RGRs) of both species by enhancing soil moisture and which in turn increased the photosynthesis and transpiration rates of the species. Compared to Y. alpina, C. sinensis had significantly (P < 0.05) higher height and diameter RGRs and higher transpiration rate. The maximum height RGRs of Y. alpina (0.142) and C. sinensis (0.108 cm month-1) were attained at the end of the rainy season. The highest and significant increment (266.5%) of biomass of Y. alpina was recorded in the plants subjected to combined application of biochar and deficit irrigation However, we could not confirm a significant effect of B alone on the growth parameters of the species. Hence, the integration of biochar and deficit irrigation would be essential for the successful establishment of C. sinensis and Y. alpina seedlings in farmlands of dried region.																			0167-4366	1572-9680				2023 AUG 24	2023										10.1007/s10457-023-00891-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-023-00891-7		AUG 2023											WOS:001063410200001

Pythium spp. and Fusarium spp. are among the soil pathogens causing the disease. In this study, a panel of 228 lines, named RR for root rot disease, was developed and evaluated in the greenhouse for Pythium myriotylum and in a root rot naturally infected field trial for plant vigor, number of plants germinated, and seed weight. The results showed positive and significant correlations between greenhouse and field evaluations, as well as high heritability (0.71-0.94) of evaluated traits. In GWAS analysis no consistent significant marker trait associations for root rot disease traits were observed, indicating the absence of major resistance genes. However, genomic prediction accuracy was found to be high for Pythium, plant vigor and related traits. In addition, good predictions of field phenotypes were obtained using the greenhouse derived data as a training population and vice versa. Genomic predictions were evaluated across and within further published data sets on root rots in other panels. Pythium and Fusarium evaluations carried out in Uganda on the Andean Diversity Panel showed good predictive ability for the root rot response in the RR panel. Genomic prediction is shown to be a promising method to estimate tolerance to Pythium, Fusarium and root rot related traits, indicating a quantitative resistance mechanism. Quantitative analyses could be applied to other disease-related traits to capture more genetic diversity with genetic models.

The semiarid Loess Plateau region, characterised by fragile ecosystems and severe soil erosion, is a key area for ecological restoration and protection in China. To illustrate water use characteristics and adaptation to drought in the main forests in this area, we monitored the xylem sap flow of two typical adjacent forest communities with similar climatic characters, a secondary natural forest dominated by oak (Quercus liaotungensis) and a pure plantation of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), during 2011-2019 using Granier-type thermal dissipation probes. Solar radiation (R-S), air temperature, relative humidity (RH), precipitation and soil water content (SWC) were measured simultaneously. Throughout the whole study period, the mean diameter at breast height (DBH) and total sapwood area increased by 4.5 cm and 1.10 m(2) ha(-1), respectively in the oak forest and by 1.0 cm and 0.22 m(2) ha(-1), respectively in the black locust plantation. The monthly stand transpiration was jointly determined by phenological and meteorological factors. At the annual timescale, transpiration of the oak stand was significantly correlated with potential reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and rainfall in the previous year, whereas a significant positive relationship was detected between stand transpiration and SWC in the black locust stand. The analyses of differences between dry and wet years showed that the oak forest exhibited significantly different parameters in the regression analysis of stand transpiration to vapour pressure deficit (VPD), whereas only one parameter was clearly distinct in the black locust plantation, suggesting that its transpiration status did not fully recover even in wet years. The management of black locust plantations with weakened growth conditions should be adjusted under prolonged drought conditions. In contrast, oak forest can maintain the water balance and stable growth by efficiently controlling stomatal behaviour.

A simulated scouring experiment was conducted on five headcut plots consisting of upstream area (UA), gully headwall (GH), and gully bed (GB) to elucidate the spatiotemporal changes in flow hydraulic, energy consumption, and soil loss during headcut erosion. The flow velocity at the brink of a headcut increased as a power function of time, whereas the jet velocity entry to the plunge pool and jet shear stress either logarithmically or linearly decreased over time. The jet properties were significantly affected by upstream flow discharge. The Reynolds number, runoff shear stress, and stream power of UA and GB increased as logarithmic or power functions of time, but the Froude number decreased logarithmically over time. The Reynolds number, shear stress, and stream power decreased by 56.0 %, 63.8 %, and 55.9 %, respectively, but the Froude number increased by 7.9 % when flow dropped from UA to GB. The accumulated energy consumption of UA, GH, and GB positions linearly increased with time. In total, 91.12 %-99.90 % of total flow energy was consumed during headcut erosion, of which the gully head accounted for 77.7 % of total energy dissipation, followed by UA (18.3 %), and GB (4.0 %). The soil loss rate of the "UA-GH-GB" system initially rose and then gradually declined and levelled off. The soil loss of UA and GH decreased logarithmically over time, whereas the GB was mainly characterized by sediment deposition. The proportion of soil loss at UA and GH is 11.5 % and 88.5 %, respectively, of which the proportion of deposited sediment on GB reached 3.8 %. The change in soil loss of UA, GH, and GB was significantly affected by flow hydraulic and jet properties. The critical energy consumption initiating soil erosion of UA, GH, and GB is 1.62, 5.79, and 1.64Js(-1), respectively. These results are helpful for deepening the understanding of gully erosion process and hydrodynamic mechanisms and can also provide a scientific basis for the construction of gully erosion model and the design of gully erosion prevention measures.					chen, zhuoxin/ABH-4099-2020; Guo, Mingming/ABH-4307-2020	chen, zhuoxin/0000-0002-8673-0498; Guo, Mingming/0000-0002-4887-5688; Wang, Wen-Long/0000-0002-3594-3653													1027-5606	1607-7938				AUG 19	2021	25	8					4473	4494		10.5194/hess-25-4473-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-4473-2021													WOS:000687138800002

Yet, knowledge remains limited on the invasibility (invasion advantage of exotic species) and recoverability (recovery ability of native species) of a plant community following invasion depend on its successional stages. We selected three grasses of Setaria viridis, Artemisia gmelinii, and Bothriochloa ischemum representing early (E), middle (M), and late (L) successional species, respectively. Meanwhile, the grasses of Panicum virgatum was selected to represent exotic species (invasion species). Three types of soil were collected to treat the three E, M, and L successional species, and one type of soil was collected to treat the exotic species. We compared the performance of the three native plant species and one exotic species grown in their "own" and "other" soils in a 2-year greenhouse experiment. Our study showed that exotic species performed better in soils of E and M successional species than in the soil of L successional species. After exotic species removed, E and M successional species exhibited poor growth in the soil of exotic species, while that of L successional species performed poor in field exotic species soils, but performed better in soils disturbed by exotic species. Our study demonstrated that the invasibility and recoverability of native plant communities changed with vegetation succession.

Based on the daily precipitation data from 10 weather stations located from southeast to northwest across China from 1961-2017, the Mann-Kendall trend test was generally applied to analyze the spatiotemporal variations of precipitation. The factors influencing the precipitation changes were investigated. The results revealed that (1) the annual, summer, and winter rainfall amount (RA) exhibited increasing rates of 16.36, 12.31, and 2.49 mm/10 year, respectively. The change rates of annual rainfall days (RD) were 2.68 day/10 year in the northwest region and -1.88 day/10 year in the southeast. The annual and seasonal daily precipitation on rainy days (RP) exhibited an increasing trend. (2) All of the RA, RD, and RP values initially increased, then decreased, and then slightly increased from Southeast to Northwest China. These results proved that the RA increased with the increase of light rain in Northwest China and heavy rain in Southeast China. In addition, changes in the monsoon have altered the rate at which RA, RD, and RP vary with distance from the sea. These findings may help to provide suggestions for the rational spatial utilization of water resources in China.						liu, honghu/0000-0001-7837-5257														2073-4441				SEP	2020	12	9							2622	10.3390/w12092622	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12092622													WOS:000581325600001

Most of the previous studies on the subject have focused on links between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and vegetation productivity, but few studies have addressed the effects of West Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) on that although the early stages of the ENSO phenomenon may first develop there. In this paper, we use the mean SST values in the WPWP to construct a climate index, known as the WPWP index (WPI), and study the impacts of the WPWP on global vegetation productivity. We provide evidence for a robust link among the alternating warm and cool WPI pattern, terrestrial vegetation productivity and carbon balance. The analysis is based on both satellite observations and model simulations. The results of this study show that the warm and cool WPWP phases have inverse effects on land surface temperature and precipitation. A warm (cool) WPWP is associated with a warmer (cooler) climate on global land surfaces as well as a drier (wetter) climate in southern hemisphere, and hence enhances (suppresses) vegetation productivity in the latitudes of approximately 10-70 degrees N and suppresses (enhances) vegetation growth in the latitudes of approximately 10-30 degrees S. The underlying mechanism is also discussed. The WPI serves as a meaningful climate index for studying the ocean-vegetation teleconnections. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nitrogen (N) application is believed to improve photosynthesis in flag leaf ultimately increase final yield. Methods and Results To understand the response of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of wheat, flag leaf and the effect of N fertilization was carried out at booting stage under greenhouse during year 2018-2019 using winter wheat cultivar "Yunhan-20410' 'Yunhan-618". The results showed that the maximum chlorophyll content of flag leaves occurred at booting stage. Under, Yunhan-20410 condition, maximum photochemical quantum efficiency (FV/Fm), potential activity (phi PSII), potential activity of PSII (FV/FO), and photochemical quenching coefficient (qp) showed "high-low" variation, and the maximum values were observed between May 4 and May 12. However, Yunhan-20410 showed FV/Fm, FV/FO, and qp showed "low-high-low" curve at booting stage. Compared to Yunhan-618, Yunhan-20410 at booting stage significantly decreased FV/Fm, FV/FO, qp, and phi PSII (P<0.05), and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) significantly increased (P<0.05). Conclusion The outcome of present investigation suggest that chlorophyll fluorescence parameters could be valuable insight to understand yield stability under stress condition. Moreover, the investigated parameters could be useful criteria for selection of genotypes under varying nitrogen application levels.

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of soil water and N stresses on growth, physiological responses, leaf structure, carbon gain and WUE of maize. The plants were subjected to different soil water and N regimes to maturity. The results showed that the photosynthesis (A(n)) and stomatal conductance (G(s)) decreased significantly under the water stressed treatments across the N treatments mainly ascribed to the decreased plant water status. The moderate water stress reduced the photosynthetic capacity and activity and also caused damage to the structure of leaves, resulting in the significant reduction of A(n), and thus decreased WUEi. The dark respiration (R-d) was significantly decreased due to the damage of mitochondria, however, the R-d/A(n) increased significantly and the carbon gain was seriously compromised, eventually inhibiting biomass growth under the moderately water stressed treatment. Increasing N dose further aggravated the severity of water deficit, decreased A(n), G(s) and WUEi, damaged the structure and reduced the number of mitochondria of leaves, while increased R-d/A(n) considerably under moderate water stress. Consequently, the biomass accumulation, carbon gain and plant level WUEp in the moderately water stressed treatment decreased markedly under the high N supply. Therefore, excessive N application should be avoided when plants suffer soil water stress in maize production.

South American Dry Chaco rangelands: Positive effects of cattle trampling and transit on ecohydrological functioning	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Livestock production in drylands requires consideration of the ecological applications of ecohydrological redistribution of water. Intensive cattle trampling and the associated increase of surface runoff are common concerns for rangeland productivity and sustainability. Here, we highlight a regional livestock production system in which cattle trails and trampling surrounding an artificial impoundment are purposely managed to enhance redistribution and availability of water for cattle drinking. Based on literature synthesis and field measurements, we first describe cattle production systems and surface water redistribution in the Dry Chaco rangelands of South America, and then develop a conceptual framework to synthesize the ecohydrological impacts of livestock production on these ecosystems. Critical to this framework is the pioshere-a degraded overgrazed and overtrampled area where vegetation has difficulties growing, usually close to the water points. The Dry Chaco rangelands have three key distinctive characteristics associated with the flat sedimentary environment lacking fresh groundwater and the very extensive ranching conditions: (1) cattle drinking water is provided by artificial impoundments filled by runoff, (2) heavy trampling around the impoundment and its adjacent areas generates a piosphere that favors runoff toward the impoundment, and (3) the impoundment, piosphere, and extensive forage areas are hydrologically connected with a network of cattle trails. We propose an ecohydrological framework where cattle transit and trampling alter the natural water circulation of these ecosystems, affecting small fractions of the landscape through increased runoff (compaction in piosphere and trails), surface connectivity (convergence of trails to piosphere to impoundment), and ponding (compaction of the impoundment floor) that operate together making water harvesting and storage possible. These effects have likely generated a positive water feedback on the expansion of livestock in the region with a relatively low impact on forage production. We highlight the role of livestock transit as a geomorphological agent capable of reshaping the hydrology of flat sedimentary rangelands in ways that can be managed positively for sustainable ranching systems. We suggest that the Dry Chaco offers an alternative paradigm for rangelands in which cattle trampling may contribute to sustainable seminatural production systems with implications for other dry and flat rangelands of the world.

J	Riar, A; Gill, G; McDonald, G				Riar, Amritbir; Gill, Gurjeet; McDonald, Glenn			Different Post-Sowing Nitrogen Management Approaches Required to Improve Nitrogen and Water Use Efficiency of Canola and Mustard	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Strategic use of nitrogen (N) may improve N use efficiency, but there is limited information on the influence of N supply at crucial growth stages on N accumulation, water use, and water use efficiency of canola and mustard. In this study, we hypothesize that genetic variation among canola and mustard can alter the response of timing and rate of post-sowing N application at targeted phenological growth stages by improving N and water use and their efficiencies. Field experiments were conducted in South Australia during two growing seasons with contrasting water availabilities. Two mustard and four canola cultivars, including two triazine tolerant (TT) and two non-TT cultivars were evaluated under different post-sowing N application strategies comprising three N rates and different timings of application. Mustard used more water than canola in the season with higher rainfall, but canola and mustard used similar amounts of water in the drier season. Nitrogen increased the water use efficiency (WUE) of canola and mustard cultivars. Nitrogen rate and timing did not influence the total water use of canola and mustard but influenced the partitioning of pre- and post-flowering water use. Even though, highest N uptake was observed in the treatment with continuous supply of N with 200 kg N ha(-1)in five splits it did not influence the N efficiencies parameters which indicate that yield of canola and mustard are limited by N rate in these environments. In treatment with limited N supply, targeting N at the rosette stage improve N use efficiency of canola and mustard. However, the limited N uptake potential of mustard makes timing of N application the most important consideration whereas correct N rate should be main consideration for canola.

Mulching technology can effectively modify the crop growth environment and crop production due to differences in climatic conditions, spatial distribution characteristics, and cropping systems. Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the eff;ects of plastic mulching (PM) and straw mulching (SM) on the yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of maize cropping in China using data obtained from 176 peer-reviewed publications. The results showed that plastic mulching significantly increased maize yield (29.24%) and WUE (29.45%). The eff;ects of mulching on maize were also improved by 12.02% (yield) and 11.43% (WUE). At the regional scale, maize yield and WUE were influenced by diff;erent planting regions and mulching management practices. Plastic mulching performed best in the North maize region and the Huanghuaihai maize region of China, while straw mulching performed better in the Southern hilly maize region of China. Plastic mulching was the best way to increase maize yield (59.56%) and WUE (29.91%) with mulching in fallow period, and straw mulching was the best way to increase maize yield (12.43%) and WUE (13.21%) with mulching in the growth period. Full plastic mulching could significantly increase maize yield (42.06%), and among different amounts of straw, mulching with 10-15 t ha(-1) performed the best, boosting the maize yield by 13.35%. Transparent film and ridge row mulching were more favorable to maize growth and increased crop yield and WUE in the arid and low temperature areas of China. In conclusion, plastic mulching can significantly increase maize yield and WUE, the adoption of mulching practices and management practices has more application prospects.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 20	2019	225								105741	10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105741	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105741													WOS:000495462200005
