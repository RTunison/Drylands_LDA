Therefore, a 2-year field experiment was conducted to research the effects of film mulching and N fertilization on soil microbial communities. The four main treatments were N0F0, N0F1, N1F0, and N1F1, combining two N fertilizer rates (N0, 0kgN ha(-1); N1, 225kgN ha(-1)) and two mulching methods (F0, no mulching; F1, film mulching) in the absence and presence of plants. The film mulching treatments significantly increased the mean temperature by 0.2 degrees C and decreased the soil organic carbon (SOC), mineral N and water soluble organic C by 5.6%, 35.5% and 24.0%, respectively. The N fertilization treatments significantly increased the mineral N, water soluble organic N and KMnO4-oxidizable C by 117.9%, 256.4% and 55.3%, respectively. Additionally, the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis of the soil microbial community revealed that the film mulching treatments significantly decreased the total PLFAs by 21.5% and the absolute abundance of fungi (F), bacteria (B), and actinomycetes by 26.7%, 23.1% and 24.6%, respectively. N fertilization significantly decreased the Gram-positive B/Gram-negative B ratio by 9.8%. Film mulching combining N fertilization significantly decreased the F/B ratio by 10.0%. Temperature (P<0.001) and SOC/total P (P<0.001) were confirmed to play significant roles in shaping the soil microbial community. Accordingly, short-term film mulching increases soil organic matter decomposition in the top soil and decreases the total soil microbial biomass and most microbial communities.					li, xiu/GXV-1745-2022; liu, qi/IQR-4870-2023; Li, Shiqing/AAG-8907-2019; wang, shaojie/HHY-8634-2022; LIU, HAO/JBI-9623-2023	Li, Shiqing/0000-0001-6886-7637; wang, shaojie/0000-0002-6818-3136; 													1385-1314	1573-0867				JUN	2019	114	2					157	170		10.1007/s10705-019-09998-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-019-09998-9													WOS:000468242200005

However, there are several unanswered questions, such as: Do organic farmers generate higher profits? Will the cost of cultivation reduce to compensate for low yields? Can farmers practice as per the organic agriculture protocols and obtain certification? The literature on organic agriculture varies widely in terms of profitability, yields and costs of organic products. A few studies have researched site-specific organic agriculture, but none have compared organic with conventional agriculture at larger scale in India. The Indian government has promoted organic agriculture since 2015 through its pan-India scheme-Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY). Under this program, there were 13.9 million certified organic farmers in 29,859 organic clusters, covering 0.59 million hectares (about 0.4% of the cropped area in India). This study assessed the implementation process of PKVY and the impact at the farmer level using the Difference-in-Difference approach. An economic surplus model was employed to observe the macro scale using data from an all-India representative sample from 576 clusters for the crop year 2017. The results identified that organic farmers experienced 14-19 percent less costs and 12-18 percent lower yields than conventional farmers. The net result is a marginal increase in profitability compared to traditional agriculture. The economy-wide economic surplus model indicates that there will be a reduction in producer and consumer surplus due to reduced crop yields. However, if the shift from conventional to organic is confined to rainfed, hilly and tribal areas, there will be an increase in both consumer and producer surplus.

Soil ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) plays an important role in sustainable regional development. However, few studies have investigated the impacts of artificial grasslands on soil EMF. Here, we constructed single-species artificial grasslands in a natural temperate steppe and investigated soil microbial communities, abiotic factors (soil moisture and pH), and functions related to biogeochemical cycles to explore (1) how the transformation from temperate steppe to artificial grasslands affected soil EMF and (2) the roles of species and phylogenetic microbial diversities, microbial community composition, and abiotic factors in driving differences in soil EMF. Our results showed that artificial grasslands decreased soil EMF regardless of planting species; that the bacterial and fungal community composition contributed more to soil EMF prediction than species and phylogenetic diversities; and that microbial phylogenetic diversities were negatively associated with soil EMF. Soil pH played an important role in the effects of artificial grasslands on soil EMF-artificial grasslands increased soil pH, which was negatively associated with soil EMF. Overall, the benefits of establishing artificial grasslands, for example, higher grass production and quality, might be at the expense of soil EMF. Further studies should explore mixed-species artificial grasslands.					li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; chen, wenjing/IZE-8536-2023															2073-4395				NOV	2021	11	11							2092	10.3390/agronomy11112092	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11112092													WOS:000725772700001

Microbial iron [Fe(III)] reduction is an important biogeochemical process that can be stimulated by ferrihydrite amendment to paddy soil. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the abundance and succession of the N-2-fixing bacterial community in ferrihydrite enriched paddy soils collected from Hunan (HN) and Sichuan (SC) provinces, China. The relationship between the N-2-fixing bacterial community and Fe(III) reduction was also assessed. When compared with the control treatment, ferrihydrite enrichment significantly enhanced nitrogenase (nifH) gene abundance by 8.05 x 10(5) to 4.45 x 10(6) copies g(-1) soil during the 40-day flooding of HN soil, while nifH gene abundance in SC soil was remarkably increased by 5.90 x 10(7) to 9.56 x 10(7) copies g(-1) soil during day 1 to 5 in response to ferrihydrite amendment. The relative abundance of N-2-fixing bacteria peaked on day 5 (21.5% in HN soil and 5.4% in SC soil) and gradually decreased to a stable abundance after day 20. Remarkable increases in relative abundance of N-2-fixing bacteria during the first 10 days of flooding were detected in both soils with ferrihydrite enrichment, whereas little difference was found after day 10 of flooding. During the early stage of flooding, the Shannon and Simpson indexes of N-2-fixing bacteria with ferrihydrite enrichment were significantly decreased, and the community structure changed greatly. Most N-2-fixing bacteria in ferrihydrite enriched paddy soils were phylogenetically related to the order Clostridiales, with some of those potentially capable of Fe(III) reduction. The community succession of N2-fixing bacteria closely correlated with Fe(III) reduction. Thus, improving N-2-fixation via stimulation of Fe(III) reduction might aid in the reduction of N-fertilizer application to paddy field. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A field survey method was used to investigate the erosional effects of the 7.26 heavy rainfall event on unpaved loess roads in the Jiuyuangou watershed of the Loess Plateau, China. The results showed that the average and maximum widths of the eroded gullies that formed on the unpaved roads were 0.65-1.48 m and 1.00-3.60 m, respectively. The average and maximum depths of the eroded gullies were 0.42-1.13 m and 0.75-4.30 m, respectively. The average width-to-depth ratio was 1.31, indicating that the widening effect was greater than the downcutting effect in the eroded gullies. In addition, the gully density ranged from 0.07 to 0.29 m m(-2), and the road surface dissection degree ranged from 0.03 to 0.41 km(2) km(-2). Eroded gullies generally developed at the slope toe of the cut bank side. The average eroded gully width and depth at turns in the road were 1.47-2.64 times and 1.30-3.47 times greater, respectively, than those in other road sections. The road erosion modulus increased from the upper section to the lower section of the roads. The average road erosion modulus of the study catchment was 235,000 t km(-2). Turns in the road were associated with collapses, sinkholes and other gravitational erosion phenomena. The amount of road erosion under extreme rainfall conditions is mainly related to the interactions among road length, width, slope and soil bulk density. Our results provide a useful reference for developing further measures for preventing road erosion on the Loess Plateau.

SELECTING THE SUPERIOR GENOTYPE OF SUMMER MAIZE HYBRIDS IN MEGA-ENVIRONMENTS USING AMMI MODEL AND GGE BIPLOT IN CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Effective analysis of genotype by environment interactions (GET) is helpful to screen stable genotypes in a variety of environments. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to test the stability and adaptability of the agronomic traits of maize hybrids from different ecological environments. Thirteen maize hybrids in twenty-six locations over two years (2017-2018) in Huanghuaihai region was conducted to compare the performance and stability of six agronomic traits using AMMI (additive main effect and multiplicative interaction) model and GGE (genotype, genotype x environment) biplot. The analysis of variance through AMMI model showed that genotype (G), environment (E), and GEI had significant effects on agronomic traits. E explains a larger portion of the total variation in grain yield (GY), ear weight (EW) and 100-grain weight (100-GW), to a much higher degree than GEI and G. However, compared to E and G, GEI contributed more to total variation in ear length (EL), kernel row number (KRN) and bald tip length (BTL). Comprehensive analysis of the AMMI model and the GGE biplot results showed that genotypes G2, G3, and G4 had better agronomic performance and stability than other genotypes and are ideal for planting.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2020	18	2					3593	3614		10.15666/aeer/1802_35933614	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1802_35933614													WOS:000530720800098

The turnover of SOC is mainly regulated by extracellular enzymes secreted by microorganisms. However, the response mechanism of soil C-degrading enzymes and SOC in litter decomposition remains unclear. To clarify how SOC fraction dynamics respond to C-degrading enzymes in litter decomposition, we used field experiments to collect leaf litter and SOC fractions from the underlying layer in Robinia pseudoacacia plantations on the Loess Plateau. Our results showed that SOC, easily oxidizable organic C, dissolved organic C, and microbial biomass C increased significantly during the decomposition process. Litter decomposition significantly decreased soil hydrolase activity, but slightly increased oxidase activity. Correlation analysis results showed that SOC fractions were significantly positively correlated with the litter mass, lignin, soil moisture, and oxidase activity, but significantly negatively correlated with cellulose content and soil pH. Partial least squares path models revealed that soil C-degrading enzymes can directly or indirectly affect the changes of soil C fractions. The most direct factors affecting the SOC fractions of topsoil during litter decomposition were litter lignin and cellulose degradation, soil pH, and C-degrading enzymes. Furthermore, regression analysis showed that the decrease of SOC stability in litter decomposition was closely related to the decrease of soil hydrolase to oxidase ratio. These results highlighted that litter degradation-induced changes in C-degrading enzyme activity significantly affected SOC fractions. Furthermore, the distribution of soil hydrolases and oxidases affected the stability of SOC during litter decomposition. These findings provided a theoretical framework for a more comprehensive understanding of C turnover and stabilization mechanisms between plant and soil.																			0095-3628	1432-184X				AUG	2023	86	2					1189	1199		10.1007/s00248-022-02113-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-022-02113-6		SEP 2022						36123554					WOS:000857854500001

Using 3D scanner to study gully evolution and its hydrological analysis in the deep weathering of southern China	CATENA												This study integrated 3D scanner measurement techniques with hydrological analysis to study the evolution of gullies developed in the deep weathering (granite) in the subtropical climate of southern China. Two gullies were repeatedly measured using a 3D laser scanner over a 7.5-year period from 2009 to 2016. The measurements with sub-centimeter accuracy indicated that gully head retreat was the dominant process in the gully development, with a mean rate of 0.46 and 1.10 m yr(-1) for gully A and B respectively. To explore the relationship between gully head retreat (GHR) and hydrologic variables, rainfall with three different thresholds, rainfall erosivity and runoff depth were calculated using different methods. Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between GHR rates and cumulative erosive rainfall depth with a daily rainfall threshold > 25 mm. Hydrological analysis and field observations suggested that gully head retreats mainly result from mass movement triggered by gravity and soil saturation, although water erosion might also play a role in destabilizing the already unstable gully slopes. This study has implications for restoration of gullies in the area, which requires techniques that go beyond a mere reduction of runoff contribution to gully systems. Further studies are needed to gather more data on the evolution and sediment delivery of gullies, to prove the hypothesis of gravity-driven gully headcut development, and to explore more effective gully restoration techniques.

However, few studies have estimated watershed sediment source connections and transport impacted by multiple check dams. This is due to the complexity of particle sorting under flood discharge practices. Here, we attempt to identify sediment sources with three connected check dams in an agricultural Mollisol catchment in Northeast China based on optimal fingerprints screened from different size fractions (i.e., <10, <63, and <1000 mu m). The results showed consistent sediment contributions based on fine particle size ranges (i.e., <10 and <63 mu m) but an inconsistent contribution based on a coarse particle size range (i.e., <1000 mu m), regardless of the particle size or the organic corrections applied. Sediment deposited in check dams No. 1 and No. 2 was mainly from hillslopes (cropland) (>66.7 %), while sediment in check dam No. 3 was from its adjacent upstream check dam (i.e., No. 2; >60.5 %) based on optimal fingerprints screened from <10 and <63 mu m particle size ranges. However, when fingerprints were screened from a coarse particle size (<1000 mu m), sediment in all three check dams was mainly from gully slopes (>79.0 %), regardless of the specific surface area (SSA) of particles or the soil organic carbon (SOC) correction factors used in the model except for SOC correction for check dam No. 2. Conversely, sediment was mainly derived from hillslopes when fingerprint values were corrected using SSA and SOC, except that no optimal fingerprints were selected. This indicated the feasibility of sediment source discrimination based on the composite fingerprinting approach for sediment source identifi-cation in catchments with a series of connected check dams under the condition that particle fractions impacted by check dams are relatively weak. However, optimal fingerprints screened from a relatively wide range of coarse particles caused divergent results regardless of the particle size or the organic correction factors used in model estimation or in fingerprint values. Further studies are necessary to explore the reliability of the composite fingerprinting approach for sediment source tracing under a series of connected check dams, where coarse sediment is selectively deposited and fine sediment is massively discharged under flood discharge practices.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2023	617		C						129045	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.129045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.129045		JAN 2023											WOS:000919052700001

Results showed that diseases, parasite infections, feed shortage, inadequate veterinary services and recurrent drought were the major constraints. Out of 205 calves, 185 had manifested 256 disease symptoms and 34 of them were died. Thus, a calf had 74.7% and 16.4% likelihood of developing a disease and dying during the cohort period. The incidence of diarrhea, pneumonia, camel pox and septicemia were 59, 51, 38 and 17 cases per 100 calves-six-months at risk, respectively. The risk of diarrhea (hazard ratio = 1.15) and pneumonia (HR = 1.48) were higher during the wet season and in calves kept on communal grazing than others. The hazard of camel pox incidence was higher during dry periods and in calves fed limited amount of colostrum. The mortality rate was found to be lower among calves above three months (HR = 0.31), calves with normal delivery (HR = 0.32) and those kept at homestead (HR = 0.45) compared to others.

Strong diel dynamics (e.g., a regular daily cycle) were found for networks with Cichorieae, which typically close their flowers around noon. Here, we experimentally prevented early flower closure to test whether these dynamics are driven by the temporally limited availability of Cichorieae, or by timing of pollinator activity. We further tested if the dynamics involving Cichorieae and their pollinators also affect the dynamics on other plants in the network. Finally, we explored the structure of such manipulated networks (with Cichorieae available in the morning and afternoon) compared to unmanipulated controls (Cichorieae available only in the morning). We found that flower closure of Cichorieae is indeed an important driver of diel network dynamics, while other drivers of pollinator timing appeared less important. If Cichorieae flowers were available in the afternoon, they were visited by generalist and specialist pollinators, which overall decreased link turnover between morning and afternoon. Effects of afternoon availability of Cichorieae on other plants in the network were inconclusive: pollinator switching to and from Cichorieae tended to increase. On the level of the aggregated (full-day) network, the treatment resulted in increased dominance of Cichorieae, reducing modularity and increasing plant generality. These results highlight that network dynamics can be predicted by knowledge of diel or seasonal phenology, and that fixed species timing assumptions will misrepresent the expected dynamics.

In this paper, regional projects mean projects implemented jointly in at least three countries, thereby providing sustainable regional public goods. Propensity score matching analysis is used to determine the difference in net benefits accrued to the on-farm participants compared to non-participants. The propensity scores show that participants have overall higher crop and livestock productivity, enhanced household income, increased soil and water management, and access to biofortified foods compared to non-participants.

We analyzed NEP and ET over 11 years in a subtropical coniferous plantation, and wavelet analysis was used to determine spectrum characteristics of these fluxes and quantify the time lag between these fluxes and environmental factors from daily to annual timescales. The NEP and ET had significant daily and annual spectrum variabilities, but ET exhibited a broader significant spectrum than NEP from days to months timescales. At daily and annual timescales, NEP was significantly synchronized with, and preceded photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and Ta by 1. 12 +/- 0.6 h and 23.16 +/- 17 days, respectively. Meanwhile, ET was significantly synchronized with net radiation (Rn) at both daily and annual timescales, lagging Rn by 1.15 +/- 1.4 h, but preceding it by 5.73 +/- 4.39 days, respectively. From days to months timescales, with no continuous significant effect, NEP preceded PAR and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and lagged soil water content (SW); however, ET only preceded Rn and VPD. In addition, summer high-Ta enhanced the effect of SW on NEP and ET across multiple timescales. Early spring cool-Ta shortened the time lag between PAR and NEP at daily and annual timescales, but only shortened it between Ta and ET at a daily timescale. This study demonstrated the more modulating effect of SW on the dominant influence of solar energy on NEP than ET, with timescale increased. This study also indicated that NEP and ET were more sensitive to high-than cool-Ta, and the time lag effects of these Ta events should be considered separately to adequately acknowledge the response mechanisms of these fluxes.					wang, hui/HSG-6135-2023; Wang, Hui/HMU-9512-2023; wang, huimin/HDM-8421-2022														0168-1923	1873-2240				APR 15	2021	300								108310	10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108310		JAN 2021											WOS:000635674500002
J	Li, P; Zhang, KD; Wang, JW; Feng, DQ				Li, Pu; Zhang, Kuandi; Wang, Jingwen; Feng, Deqian			Response of interrill erosion to flow parameters of sand loess in regions with high and coarse sediment yields	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In the Loess Plateau, regions with high and coarse sediment yields are the main sources of the Yellow River sediments. The responses of the interrill erosion rate of the soil in this area (Shenmu soil) to flow intensity parameters were systematically investigated through indoor artificially simulated rainfall experiments considering five slope gradients (0.1564, 0.2079, 0.2588, 0.309, and 0.3584) and five rainfall intensities (60, 80, 100, 120 and 140 mm.h(-1)). Thereafter, an interrill erosion model was established based on two types of soil: Shenmu soil and Ansai soil. The experimental data of Ansai soil were obtained from a study by Wu et al. (2017). The results showed that for Shenmu soil, the interrill erosion mechanism can be classified into two types. The first type was detachment-limited interrill erosion in the initial rainfall phase and transport-limited interrill erosion in the subsequent rainfall. The other type was transport-limited interrill erosion during the entire rainfall duration. Among the flow intensity parameters (i.e., mean flow velocity (R-2 = 0.92), shear stress (R-2 = 0.84), stream power (R-2 = 0.96), and unit stream power (R-2 = 0.82)), stream power was found to be satisfactory for predicting the interrill erosion rate of Shenmu soil in terms of the coefficient of determination (R-2). However, the interrill erosion rate model based on the stream power for the two types of soil exhibited low prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a general flow intensity parameter was derived to predict the interrill erosion rate of overland flow. Based on this parameter, an interrill erosion rate model for the two types of soil was formulated by multiple regression analysis with an R-2 value of 0.96, a relative root mean square error of 18.9%, and a model efficiency of 0.94. Overall, this general flow intensity parameter was shown to be the preferred predictor for estimating the interrill erosion rate for steep slopes in the regions with high and coarse sediment yields.					wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022; wang, jing/HJA-5384-2022; wang, jian/HRB-9588-2023; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; wang, dan/JEF-0836-2023; wang, jie/HTQ-4920-2023; wang, juan/IUO-6218-2023	Zhang, Kuandi/0000-0002-1745-8435													0022-1694	1879-2707				JAN	2021	592								125786	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125786	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125786													WOS:000639844900032

Artificial reseeding was a widely used strategy for the restoration of alpine sandy grasslands. However, it is still unclear whether reseeding restoration can improve multiple ecosystem functions of sandy meadows. To narrow these knowledge gaps, we evaluated the changes in plant communities, soil conditions, and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) across native meadow, sandy meadow, and restored meadow on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, and further identified the links between individual and multiple ecosystem functions. Artificial reseeding had contributed to the promotion of plant diversity, productivity, soil fertility, and soil carbon and nitrogen sequestrations. However, the recovery levels of plant diversity, productivity, and soil fertility in the restored meadow were still far lower than that in the native meadow. The results revealed that the EMF index of the restored meadow increased greatly compared with the sandy meadow, but it did not recover to that of the native meadow level. In addition, short-term reseeding improved the aboveground EMF index more than the belowground EMF index. The EMF indexes and most individual ecosystem functions showed positive correlations with plant diversity and productivity. These findings indicated an important role of artificial reseeding in the restoration of ecosystem functions in the alpine sandy meadow, and it had critical implications for the regional ecological security and sustainable development of alpine grasslands.

We therefore investigated the effects of different intensity levels, exemplified by three rates of mineral nitrogen (N) addition and irrigation on CO2 emissions in typical crops during the wet (Kharif) and dry (Rabi) season on a Nitisol in Bengaluru, S-India. Respiration data were collected from 2017 to 2021 in two two-factorial split-plot experiments conducted under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Test crops were maize (Zea mays L.), finger millet (Eleusine coracana Gaertn.), and lablab (Lablab purpureus L. Sweet) under rainfed and irrigated conditions, as well as the vegetables cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata), eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) or chili (Capsicum annuum L.). Carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions were determined using a Los Gatos Research (LGR) multi-gas analyzer whereby under our study conditions CH4, NH3 and N2O were negligible. Measurements were conducted from 7:00 am to 11:30 am and repeated from 12:30 pm to 6:00 pm. Irrespective of irrigation, season, crops and N fertilizer level, CO2 emission rates during afternoon hours were significantly higher (2-128%) than during morning hours. In the irrigated field diurnal emission differences between afternoon and morning hours ranged from 0.04 to 1.61 kg CO2 -C ha(-1) h(-1) while in the rainfed field they averaged 0.20(-1).78 kg CO2 -C ha(-1) h(-1). Irrespective of crops, in the rainfed field CO2 emissions in high N plots were 56.4% larger than in low N plots whereas in the irrigated field they were only 12.1% larger. The results of a linear mixed model analysis indicated that N fertilization enhanced CO2 emissions whereby these effects were highest in rainfed crops. Soil moisture enhanced emissions in rainfed crops but decreased them under irrigation where crop-specific CO2 emissions within a season were independent of N application. Soil temperature at 5 cm depth enhanced CO2 emissions in both fields. Overall, higher N and soil temperature enhanced CO2 fluxes whereas effects of soil moisture depended on irrigation.																			1385-1314	1573-0867				2023 SEP 15	2023										10.1007/s10705-023-10311-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-023-10311-y		SEP 2023											WOS:001067538000001
J	Su, BQ; Su, ZX; Shangguan, ZP				Su, Bingqian; Su, Zhuoxia; Shangguan, Zhouping			Trade-off analyses of plant biomass and soil moisture relations on the Loess Plateau	CATENA												Plant biomass is a crucial parameter for terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling. Water plays a crucial role in biomass production, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. However, the trade-off relationships between the plant biomass and soil moisture have not been well investigated on the Loess Plateau. In our study, we synthesized 615 pairs of data to evaluate the trade-off between the plant biomass and soil moisture in different precipitation areas and vegetation restoration ages on the Loess Plateau using the quantitative trade-off method. The results showed that precipitation had the strongest effect on soil moisture content (SMC), and aboveground biomass (AGB) was controlled more by vegetation restoration type and elevation, whereas belowground biomass (BGB) was controlled more by vegetation restoration age and elevation. SMC had a higher relative benefit than AGB and BGB in most precipitation areas. In addition, vegetation restoration age is another critical variable to determine the trade-offs between AGB and SMC and between BGB and SMC. For forest, the minimum trade-off of restoration years was > 10 years, but it was < 10 years for shrubland and grassland. Because the trade-offs between AGB and SMC and between BGB and SMC revealed a large spatial change on the whole Loess Plateau, the vegetation in different precipitation areas should identify suitable management strategy to maintain benefits. Understanding the relationship between the plant biomass and soil moisture will improve our ability to sustainably manage vegetation construction and water resources.						zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310													0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2021	197								104946	10.1016/j.catena.2020.104946	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.104946													WOS:000597208600005
J	Zhang, L; Meng, Y; Li, SQ; Yue, SC				Zhang, Liang; Meng, Yuan; Li, Shiqing; Yue, Shanchao			High-yield characteristics and root support of rain-fed maize under film mulching	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Full ridge-furrow plastic film-mulching (FM) is an important drought-resistant and high-yield agricultural method employed in the Loess Plateau. The characteristics of FM, which are closely related to high-efficiency resource utilization and root-shoot coordination of crops, may serve as references for yield increases in a broad range of farmland types. However, few studies have investigated this topic. A 2-yr field study was conducted in the rain-fed arid farmland of the Loess Plateau experimental station to investigate the canopy development and root support of FM maize (Zea mays L.). Our results showed that FM not only accelerated canopy growth in the vegetative phase and prolonged the reproductive phase but also promoted N and biomass accumulation in leaves after flowering. The leaf N concentration and biomass in FM maize increased by 6.2-24.7% and 16.9-29.3%, respectively, during R1 (silking)-R3 (milk) stage compared with the control. However, although the total root biomass decreased, and less RL (root length) and root surface area were distributed in deep soil, FM reduced the decline rate of RL and surface area during the R1-R3 period by 20.5 and 15.2% in topsoil, respectively, compared to the control. Moreover, FM significantly increased the root efficiency of leaf nitrogen (REN) absorption by 66.7-84.6% at the R1 stage and increased the water use efficiency (WUE) of grain yield by 20.3-69.4%. In conclusion, maize plants under FM had strengthened photosynthetic organs with high efficiency and long-lasting root support in a prolonged reproductive phase.

Evaluating the use of nitrogen and phosphorous fertilization as crop management options for maize adaptation to climate change in the Nigeria savannas	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Poor soil fertility and climate variability are major constraints to maize production in the Nigeria savannas. The application of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) as adaptation strategy may enhance maize yield under climate change. In this study, the already calibrated and validated CERES-maize model in DSSAT was used to simulate the response of maize varieties to N and P in three agroecological zones. Similarly, the model, coupled with data for representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios, was applied to simulate maize yields for mid-century and end-of-century periods and to estimate the effect of use of N and P as a strategy for maize adaptation to climate change. Results of a 30-year sensitivity analysis showed that the optimum grain yields were obtained with application of 150 kg N + 30 kg P ha(-1) to the two varieties in Kano and Zaria. In Abuja, the optimum grain yields were obtained with the application of 150 kg N ha(-1) + 30 kg P ha(-1) to SAMMAZ-15 and 120 kg N ha(-1) + 30 kg P ha(-1) to SAMMAZ-16. When P is not applied, the simulation results show that across all N rates, maize yield would decrease by 25%-52% and 32%-52% for the mid- and end-of-century, respectively, under RCP4.5 for both varieties. There would be a greater reduction under RCP8.5, with a decrease of 32%-59% and 52%-69% under mid- and end-of-century scenarios, respectively. When P is applied at 30 kg ha(-1), the reduction in yield due to climate change is lower. Under RCP4.5, the yield would decrease by 9%-15% and 11%-21% for the mid- and end-of-century, respectively. There would be a reduction of 12%-21% and 32%-41% for mid-century and end-of-century, respectively, under RCP8.5 scenario. This suggests that the application of optimum P could reduce the impact of yield loss due to climate change.

The results of the GC-MS analysis revealed significant differences in the essential oil content. Significant variability was observed in the chemical constituents of the essential oils mainly for p-cymene, D-limonene, Gamma-terpinene, Cumic aldehyde and 1, 4-p-menthadien-7-al. Among these compounds, the highest average percentage across the locations was observed for gamma-terpinene (32.08%) which was followed by cumic aldehyde (25.07%), and 1, 4-p-menthadien-7-al (15.45%). Principal component analysis (PCA) also grouped the 4 highly significant compounds i.e., p-Cymene, Gamma-Terpinene, Cumic aldehyde, and 1,4-p-Menthadien-7-al into same cluster which are mainly distributed in Shalimar Kalazeera-1, and Atholi Kishtwar zones. The highest value of gamma-terpinene was recorded in Atholi accession (40.66%). However, among climatic zones Zabarwan Srinagar and Shalimar Kalazeera-1 was found to have highly positive significant correlation (0.99). The cophenetic correlation coefficient (c) was found to be 0.8334 during hierarchical clustering for 12 essential oil compounds showing that our results are highly correlated. Network analysis also showed the overlapping pattern and similar interaction between the 12 compounds as shown by hierarchical clustering analysis. From the results, it could be concluded that existence of variability among the various bioactive compounds of B. persicum which are probably to be incorporated to the potential list of drugs and may serve as good genetic source for various modern breeding programs.

J	Zhao, Y; Wang, L				Zhao, Ying; Wang, Li			Determination of groundwater recharge processes and evaluation of the 'two water worlds' hypothesis at a check dam on the Loess Plateau	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Areas with shallow groundwater and check dams have relatively abundant water resources compared to tablelands with deep loess layers on the Loess Plateau in China, but little attention has been paid to their potentially substantial role in groundwater recharge to date. In addition, during groundwater recharge preferential flow through macropores can replenish groundwater quickly, leaving immobile bound water relatively unmixed. Different water paths result in the separation of groundwater and plant xylem water isotopic signals, according to the 'two water worlds' (TWW) hypothesis. The hypothesis has received wide attention in the last decade due to observations of stronger H-2 and O-18 enrichment (higher delta H-2 and delta O-18 values) in plant xylem water than in groundwater. Thus, aims of this study were to analyze processes involved in groundwater recharge and evaluate the TWW hypothesis by isotope (delta H-2 and delta O-18) tracing at a check dam on the Loess Plateau. We report three main findings. First, the groundwater table began to rise 35 days after the first large rain event during our study period, showing that recharge times at the site are orders of magnitude shorter than those in tablelands of the Loess Plateau (decades or hundreds of years). Second, preferential and matrix flows contributed 36% and 64%, respectively, of the total recharge. Third, when preferential flow prevailed, no significant isotopic differences between any measured water sources were found at the check-dammed site (e.g. precipitation, soil water, groundwater and plant xylem water) (p > 0.05), which conflicts with isotopic patterns predicted by the TWW hypothesis. In conclusion, check dams in areas with shallow groundwater can substantially promote water cycling from precipitation to groundwater on the Loess Plateau and in similar areas. This study also provides a link between hydrological and ecological processes (groundwater recharge paths and plant water uptake), with significant implications for fundamental ecohydrological understanding and practical hydrological predictions.

Hexavalent chromium bioremediation using <i>Hibiscus Sabdariffa</i> calyces extract: Process parameters, kinetics and thermodynamics	SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN												Hexavalent chromium toxicity remains an indispensible toxicity to bioremediation. It has environmental and health impact in areas of hexavalent chromium discharges. This persistent problem associated with hexavalent chromium toxicity had led to employment of both physical and chemical means of control, which suffers major drawbacks. These drawbacks include; incomplete metal removal, high energy requirement, high reagent consumption and high cost of implementation. Bioremediation via bioreduction can be explored using plants rich in antioxidants. Hibiscus sabdariffa is a plant rich in antioxidants. In this study the bioreduction potential of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces extract in bioremediation of toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr VI) to less toxic trivalent chromium (Cr III) was examined. In a batch mode, the effect of process parameters viz pH, temperature, initial Cr (VI) concentration, contact time and bioreductant concentration was assessed on the bioreduction process. Hexavalent chromium was quantified using diphenyl carbazide complexing agent that forms violet colour. The kinetic and thermodynamic of the process was also investigated. The extract (1 mg/ml) was able to bioreduce 72% of 10 mg/L hexavalent chromium solution in 15 min. The optimized condition of the process was achieved at pH 2.0 and 25 degrees C. Kinetics studies on the bioreduction revealed pseudo second-order as the main kinetic path the reaction takes with R-2 values of 0.928, 0.993 and 0.997. The extract has the potential to reduce hexavalent chromium which is toxic to trivalent chromium (less toxic). (C) 2020 The Authors.

Ethiopia has addressed this problem by introducing an epoch-making privatization policy for the allocation of communal land to landless farmers. This policy promotes the economic utilization of the communal land while protecting natural resources. Hitherto, few studies have evaluated the impact of the policy. We evaluate the effect of the communal land distribution policy for tree-planting using technical efficiency of farm production by estimating a stochastic production function model in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. We compare the technical efficiencies of farm production between both participating and nonparticipating farms in the program using a quasi-experimental method. The results reveal the improvement of technical efficiency through communal land distribution. Therefore, program activities could increase farm incomes while maintaining land conservation. Thus, the allocation of communal land promotes sustainable land utilization in the mountainous areas of sub-Saharan Africa.

J	Ma, CK; Li, XD; Luo, Y; Shao, MG; Jia, XX				Ma, Changkun; Li, Xiangdong; Luo, Yi; Shao, Mingan; Jia, Xiaoxu			The modelling of rainfall interception in growing and dormant seasons for a pine plantation and a black locust plantation in semi-arid Northwest China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Interception loss can remove a significant portion of rainwater from forested ecosystems. Therefore, the quantification and modelling of interception loss are of significant importance if human and ecosystem water demands are to be balanced under a future changing climate. This is particularly true for semi-arid/arid regions, where afforestation has become an important ecological restoration measure to tackle desertification, poverty and climate change. However, quantification and modelling of interception loss of plantations in these regions have rarely been reported. In the present study, rainfall interception loss was quantified and modelled over a one-year period (January-December 2016) for a deciduous broad-leafed R. pseudoacacia plantation and an evergreen needle-leaf P. tabuliformis plantation (common afforestation tree species) situated in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China. The stand age, density, canopy cover and leaf area index of R. pseudoacacia during the study period were 15 years, 2000 tree ha(-1), 0.48 and 1.41 m(2) m(-2), respectively. The corresponding values for Pinus tabuliformis were 17 years, 1200 tree ha(-1), 0.62 and 2.53 m(2) m(-2). The measured throughfall, stemflow and derived estimates of interception loss for R pseudoacacia were 81.1%, 1.3% and 17.6%, respectively. The corresponding values for P. tabuliformis were 75.4%, 0.7% and 23.9%. Given that the weather conditions experienced by the two forest stands were similar, the observed higher interception loss for P. tabuliformis can be explained by the higher canopy storage capacity and wet canopy evaporation rate of this species. The revised Gash analytical model of rainfall interception was well calibrated and validated against field measurements and was able to simulate the cumulative interception loss at two forest stands accurately, and it also effectively captured the seasonal variation (leafed growing and leafless dormant seasons), provided that the optimized wet canopy evaporation rates were used. The revised model was highly sensitive to the canopy storage capacity and changes in the ratio of mean wet canopy evaporation to mean rainfall intensity and less sensitive to canopy cover, but it was found to be fairly insensitive to the trunk storage capacity.

Flow event size influences carbon, nutrient and zooplankton dynamics in a highly regulated lowland river	HYDROBIOLOGIA												River regulation and water extraction has significantly altered flow regimes and reduced flood events in many inland river systems. Environmental flows have been adopted in many systems to mitigate the ecological impacts of river regulation, however a lack of knowledge regarding the interrelationship between flow regimes, carbon transport and instream productivity make prioritising water management difficult. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a study on the Namoi River in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, monitoring changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nutrient dynamics and planktonic food web structure during a period of variable flows. Nutrient and DOC concentrations were positively correlated with river discharge and zooplankton concentrations were highest post flow events. Planktonic chlorophyll-a, increased DOC concentration and higher discharge were the most influential drivers of change in zooplankton communities. Further, our results indicated that flow events increased production through both heterotrophic and autotrophic pathways, significantly boosting zooplankton concentration compared to base flow conditions across all measured flow events. We suggest even small in-channel flow events can be important for increasing basal and zooplankton production in rivers, and therefore should be protected or promoted by environmental flow management, particularly during drought conditions.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				2023 NOV 1	2023										10.1007/s10750-023-05392-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05392-3		NOV 2023											WOS:001091528700001

Selenium (Se) is a nutrient for humans that is acquired predominantly from plants. Localised P and Se supply may affect P- and Se-uptake efficiency. Our aim was to examine the mechanisms of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) to acquire P and Se when the elements are heterogeneously or homogeneously distributed in soil, and how P and Se supply affect plant growth and uptake of P and Se. We conducted a split-root experiment growing alfalfa in a loess soil with two distribution patterns (i.e. heterogeneous and homogeneous) of P and Se. The application rates of P (KH2PO4) and Se (Na2SeO3) were 0 and 20 mg P kg(-1), and 0 and 1 mg Se kg(-1), respectively. Our results showed that plants absorbed more Se when both P and Se were supplied homogeneously than when supplied heterogeneously. Supplying Se had a positive effect on plant P content. Localised P supply resulted in the exudation of more carboxylates by roots than homogeneous P supply did. Soil microbial biomass P was significantly greater when P was supplied homogeneously. Shoot-to-root translocation of Se had a positive effect on P-uptake efficiency. These results indicated that, compared with homogeneous P supply, localised P supply promoted P and Se uptake by increasing the amount of rhizosheath carboxylates and weakening the competition between roots and microbes. Translocation of Se within plant organs was promoted by the application of P, thus enhancing the P-uptake efficiency of alfalfa.

J	Robertson, SM; Friend, MA				Robertson, Susan M.; Friend, Michael A.			Performance of sheep systems grazing perennial pastures. 2. Wool quality and lamb growth	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE												This study evaluated wool quality and lamb production from four management systems with Merino ewes grazing a perennial pasture between 2006 and 2010, using different combinations of lambing time, ram breed and percentage of summer-active pasture species. All systems were stocked at a similar midwinter rate (dry-sheep equivalents per hectare of 8, 10.2, 13, 11.2 and 11.2 in the successive seasons 2006-2010). Liveweight, condition score, C fat and eye muscle depth at weaning of both Merino and crossbred lambs were always higher (P < 0.05) for lambs born in July than those born in September. Similarly, the sale weight of lambs born in July was always higher (P < 0.05) than of lambs born in September, partly because these lambs were usually retained for longer before sale. When lambs were born in September, sheep systems that carried higher numbers of ewes per hectare at the same midwinter stocking rate produced sale weights of lambs similar to those with fewer ewes, except where systems with fewer lambs per hectare enabled lambs to be retained for longer in favourable seasons. A higher percentage of lucerne (Medicago sativa, 40% cf. 20%) increased lamb sale weights only in favourable seasons. Clean fleece weights per ewe and staple strength were similar among systems in most years (2008-2010), although mean fibre diameter was lower (P < 0.05) in both late lambing systems (with 40% and 20% lucerne). The results indicate that choice of lambing time, ram breed and the flexibility to alter lamb sale date with seasonal conditions will have a larger impact on the performance of individuals than number of ewes per hectare where systems are grazed at the same midwinter stocking rate.

Hence, 121 barley landraces, advanced breeding lines and varieties were evaluated under both moisture non-stress and stress field conditions using a lattice square (11x11) design with two replications for each set of trials. Twelve drought tolerance indices (SSI, TOL, MP, GMP, STI, YI, YSI, HM, SDI, DI, RDI and SSPI) were used based on grain yield under normal (Yp) and drought (Ys) conditions. Analysis of variance showed a significant genetic variation among genotypes for all indices with the exception of TOL and SSPI indices. Yp had a very strong association with Ys (r=0.92**) that indicates high yield potential under non-stress can predict better yield under stress conditions. Yp and Ys were positively and significantly correlated with MP, GMP, STI, YI, HM and DI indices, whereas they were negatively correlated with SSI and SDI. In principal component analysis (PCA), the first PC explained 64% of total variation with Yp, Ys, MP, GMP, STI, YI, HM and DI. The second PC explained 35.6% of the total variation and had positive correlation with SSI, TOL, SDI and SSPI. It can be concluded that MP, GMP, STI, YI, HM and DI indices with the most positive and significant correlation with yield at both non-stress and stress environments would be better indices to screen barley genotypes, although none of the indices could undoubtedly identify high yield genotypes under both conditions.

Decoupling the effects of vegetation dynamics and climate variability on watershed hydrological characteristics on a monthly scale from subtropical China	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Hydrological characteristics are expected to be affected by climate variability and vegetation dynamics which are interconnected and coupled in most cases. Few studies have decoupled the effects of vegetation dynamics and climate variability on hydrological characteristics, a process that benefit both water resources management and agricultural water allocation. In this study, we used partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to decouple the effects of climate variability and vegetation on the temporal variations in hydrological characteristics on a monthly scale in the Upper Du watershed (8973 km(2)) in subtropical China. Monthly hydrometeorological and vegetation cover data were collected from 2000 to 2010. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived vegetation indices were used to represent the vegetation status of the watershed. The results showed that vegetation dynamics and climate variability account for up to 67% of the temporal variation in runoff, whereas the combined effects of vegetation, climate and runoff explain 62% of the variation in sediment. Climate variability both directly affects monthly hydrological characteristics and indirectly affects these characteristics through its effects on vegetation. Vegetation is negatively correlated with both runoff and sediment, and the net effect of vegetation on the sediment load (total effect = -0.20) is greater than its effect on runoff (total effect = -0.12). Our results indicate that the direct effect of vegetation on sediment (direct effect = -0.09) is smaller than the indirect effect (indirect effect = -0.11) of vegetation on sediment through its influence on runoff; thus, vegetation reduces both the sediment concentration and the sediment load mainly by reducing runoff. Compared to conventional multivariate statistical methodologies, PLS-SEM provides additional valuable information, including the direct and indirect impacts of climatic factors and vegetation on hydrological characteristics.

Previous studies have shown that SBTs are associated with developmental processes and environmental responses. However, comprehensive identification and systematic analysis of the SBT family have not been conducted in cotton. We used bioinformatics methods to analyze the structural characteristics, phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, expression modes, evolutionary relationships, selection pressures and stress responses of SBT gene family members in upland cotton. In this study, we identified 120 and 112 SBTs in the tetraploid cotton species G. hirsutum and G. barbadense, while 67 and 69 SBTs were identified in the diploid species G. arboreum and G. raimondii, respectively; these SBTs were divided into five distinct subfamilies. We identified the SBT gene GhSBT27A, and explore its function through virus-induced gene silencing and transmission electron microscopy. These results suggested that the GhSBT27A gene was involved in the response to drought stress. These results lay a foundation for further study on the drought stress mechanism of cotton.					zhao, lin/JPK-8436-2023; zhang, yu/HNS-5948-2023														1664-462X					JAN 11	2023	13								1097732	10.3389/fpls.2022.1097732	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1097732								36714777					WOS:000920105300001
J	Qi, DL; Hu, TT; Song, X				Qi Dong-liang; Hu Tian-tian; Song Xue			Effects of nitrogen application rates and irrigation regimes on grain yield and water use efficiency of maize under alternate partial root-zone irrigation	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE												Faced with the scarcity of water resources and irrational fertilizer use, it is critical to supply plants with water and fertilizer in a coordinated pattern to improve yield with high water use efficiency (WUE). One such method, alternate partial root-zone irrigation (APRI), has been practiced worldwide, but there is limited information on the performance of different irrigation regimes and nitrogen (N) rates under APRI. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of varying irrigation regimes and N rates on shoot growth, grain yield and WUE of maize (Zea mays L.) grown under APRI in the Hexi Corridor area of Northwest China in 2014 and 2015. The three N rates were 100,200 and 300 kg N ha(-1), designated N-1, N-2 and N-3, respectively. The three irrigation regimes of 45-50%, 60-65% and 75-80% field capacity (FC) throughout the maize growing season, designated W-1, W-2 and W-3, respectively, were applied in combination with each N rate. The results showed that W-2 and W-3 significantly increased the plant height, stem diameter, crop growth rate, chlorophyll SPAD value, net photosynthetic rate (P-n) biomass, grain yield, ears per ha, kernels per cob, 1 000-kernel weight, harvest index, evapotranspiration and leaf area index (LAI) compared to W, at each N rate. The N-2 and N-3 treatments increased those parameters compared to N, in each irrigation treatment. Increasing the N rate from the N-2 to N-3 resulted in increased biomass and grain yield under 1AI 3 while it had no impact on those under the W, and W-2 treatments. The W3N3 and W2N2 and W2N3 treatments achieved the greatest and the second-greatest biomass and grain yield, respectively. Increasing the N rate significantly enhanced the maximum LAI (LAI at the silking stage) and P-n, under W-3, suggesting that the interaction of irrigation and fertilizer N management can effectively improve leaf growth and development, and consequently provide high biomass and grain yield of maize. The W2N2 , W2N3 and W3N3 treatments attained the greatest WUE among all the treatments. Thus, either 60-65% FC coupled with 200-300 kg N ha(-1) or 75-80% FC coupled with 300 kg N ha(-1) is proposed as a better pattern of irrigation and nitrogen application with positive regulative effects on grain yield and WUE of maize under APRI in the Corridor area of Northwest China and other regions with similar environments. These results can provide a basis for in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of grain yield and WUE to supply levels of of water and nitrogen.																			2095-3119					NOV	2020	19	11					2792	2806		10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63205-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63205-1													WOS:000579857800019

However, few research studies have comprehensively assessed the impacts of RFPS on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, grain yield, net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB), and net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) compared against the single practices of either plastic film mulching or straw mulching. A three-year field experiment was conducted on a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) rotation field in the southern Loess Plateau, China. Four treatments were evaluated: (1) conventional flat planting without mulching (CK), (2) flat planting with plastic film mulching (PM), (3) flat planting with straw mulching (SM), and (4) RFPS. All mulching practices significantly increased wheat and maize yields as well as the seasonal cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from soil respiration (Rs) and ecosystem respiration (Re) compared with CK. RFPS had the greatest annual grain yield and the greatest Rs for wheat seasons. The average annual NECB values for CK and PM were -1.47 and -1.05 Mg CO2-eq ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively, where the negative values indicated that the soil in CK and PM acted as a carbon (C) source. SM and RFPS acted as C sinks because of the straw C input, having average annual NECB values of 1.46 and 1.74 Mg CO2-eq ha- 1 yr- 1, respectively. PM, SM, and RFPS significantly increased the average annual NEEB by 31.4%, 70.5%, and 60.3%, respectively, compared with CK. Although RFPS had greater C input and grain yield income, it also had greater Rs, harvest removal C loss, and agricultural input costs, resulting in similar NECB and NEEB to what was observed with SM. Considering that the greatest grain yields were obtained with RFPS, this production practice should be a promising method for maintaining greater, more stable crop production, while increasing soil C sequestration and NEEB for the wheat-maize cropping system in dry semi-humid regions such as the southern Loess Plateau of China.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				MAR 1	2023	344								108311	10.1016/j.agee.2022.108311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108311		DEC 2022											WOS:000899166800004

Their adsorption-photocatalytic degradation effects on rhodamine B (RhB), tetracycline (TC), and norfloxacin (NOR) were comparatively investigated. Additionally, the effects of environmental factors, wastewater treatment tests, and disinfection were systematically studied, and the enhancement mechanisms and reasons for the degradation differences were highlighted. The results showed that ACB-Bi2WO6 and ACB-Bi2MoO6 were confirmed to form intimately contacted heterojunctions by various advanced characterization techniques. The introduction of ACB narrowed the band-gap energy of Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6, and improved the visible light absorption range and specific surface area. The optimal loading ratios of ACB-Bi2WO6 and ACB-Bi2MoO6 were 1:1.06 and 1:0.58, respectively. The removal rate of ACB-Bi2WO6 for high concentrations of RhB (200 mg center dot L-1), TC and NOR (50 mg center dot L-1) were 89.15%, 87.27%, and 72.17%, respectively, which were higher than those of ACB-Bi2MoO6 and significantly stronger than those of Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6. This was attributed to the more effective inhibition of photogenerated carrier recombination, higher absorbance, and uniform morphology via ACB-Bi2WO6. center dot OH and holes were dominant active species in photocatalysis, and the possible photogenerated carrier transfer path is type II heterojunction. Furthermore, ACB-Bi2WO6 possessed good reusability, and the removal of RhB and TC from the actual wastewater exceeded 80.63% and 58.54%, respectively. The sterilization rates of ACB-Bi2WO6 reached 99% and 95% for E. coli and S. aureus within 24 h, respectively. Therefore, ACB-Bi2WO6 was more recommended for environmental applications.

Compositional turnover in ecto- and endoparasite assemblages of an African bat, <i>Miniopterus natalensis</i> (Chiroptera, Miniopteridae): effects of hierarchical scale and host sex	PARASITOLOGY												We studied the compositional turnover in infracommunities and component communities of ecto- and endoparasites infesting a bat, Miniopterus natalensis (Chiroptera, Miniopteridae), across seven sampling sites using the zeta diversity metric (measuring similarity between multiple communities) and calculating zeta decline and retention rate (both scales) and zeta decay (component communities). We asked whether the patterns of zeta diversity differ between (a) infracommunities and component communities; (b) ecto- and endoparasites and (c) subsets of communities infecting male and female bats. The pattern of compositional turnover differed between infracommunities and component communities in endoparasites only. The shape of zeta decline for infracommunities indicated that there were approximately equal probabilities of ecto- and endoparasitic species to occur on/in any bat individual within a site. The shape of zeta decline for component communities suggested the stochasticity of ectoparasite turnover, whereas the turnover of endoparasites was driven by niche-based processes. Compositional turnover in component communities of ectoparasites was more spatially dependent than that of endoparasites. Spatial independence of compositional turnover in endoparasites was due to subcommunities harboured by female bats. We conclude that the patterns of compositional turnover in infracommunities were similar in ecto- and endoparasites, whereas the patterns of turnover in component communities differed between these groups.

Perceptions and practices of rural households toward animal welfare are influenced by socio-cultural, demographic, and agroecological factors. We conducted Community Conversations in two geographically and culturally diverse regions of Ethiopia to explore the attitudes and practices of rural households regarding animal welfare and its impact on livelihoods. Community Conversations are facilitated dialogues among rural households to explore their perceptions, practices, constraints, and needs and identify and co-create solutions to improve the welfare of their animals. We used single- and mixed-sex discussion groups to understand community members' gendered perceptions of animal welfare and influence their attitudes and practices toward gender-equitable roles in animal welfare management. In the Community Conversations, community members readily described the biological needs of their animals but there was also a good acknowledgment of the behavioral and affective state needs of animals. Identified constraints for animal welfare included feed and water shortage, limited veterinary support, and poor animal handling practices. Community members described the welfare of their animals as being intertwined with their own livelihoods and identified productive, public health, and non-economic benefits of good animal welfare. Raising awareness of animal welfare within rural communities through Community Conversations is a useful way to both identify livestock production needs as well as engage community members in making practical improvements in animal welfare. The understanding of perceptions, practices, and needs of rural households in animal welfare helps engage communities in starting behavioral change and provides insights into developing context-specific welfare improvement interventions. Community Conversations are also an effective way to feedback community voices into planning to build a bottom-up implementation of animal welfare programs.

Here, we conducted transcriptomic and physiological analyses to identify metabolic processes associated with the enhanced tolerance of the melatonin-treated maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings to water deficit. Maize seedlings were foliar sprayed with either 50 mu M melatonin or water and exposed to drought stress for 12 d in growth chambers. Drought stress significantly suppressed seedling growth, and melatonin application partially alleviated this growth inhibition. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that genes whose expression was significantly altered by melatonin were mainly related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism. Analysis of transcriptomics, enzyme activity, and metabolite content data, melatonin-treated plants exhibited a higher level of relatively stable C and N metabolism than untreated plants; this phenotype of melatonin-treated plants was associated with their higher photosynthesis, sucrose biosynthesis, N assimilation, and protein biosynthesis capacities under drought stress.

This study focused on a forest succession sequence including farmland, grassland, shrubland (i.e., Hippophae rhamnoides), pioneer forest (i.e., Populus davidiana), and climax forest (i.e., Quercus liaotungensis) on the Loess Plateau of China, to explore plant and soil changes, as well as soil microbial community dynamics. The results showed that litter biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and the ratio of SOC to TN exhibited an increasing trend in the whole process of the forest succession, and NH4+, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and the ratio of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) had significantly increased before the shrubland stage, and then they were going to be stable. During the forest succession, the main bacterial phyla present were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria, and the predominant fungal phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The soil microbial community composition was stable and did not change significantly, but the bacteria and fungal communities were associated with specific plant or soil properties. It was proved that the change of soil microbial community was closely related to vegetation and soil community changes. The results suggested that long-term forest succession not only improves plant diversity, but also improves soil biology and quality, even though it does not significantly increase soil microbial diversity. The findings enhance the understanding of the impact of soil microbial ecological characteristics and provide an important guidance for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems following long-term natural vegetation restoration.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014; 朱, 广宇/GQZ-5189-2022	Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564; zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310; ZHU, GUANGYU/0000-0002-8641-2422													0925-8574	1872-6992				JAN	2020	142								105631	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.105631	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.105631													WOS:000497646800006
J	Robertson, SM; Friend, MA				Robertson, Susan M.; Friend, Michael A.			Performance of sheep systems grazing perennial pastures. 3. Fertility, fecundity and lamb survival	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE												Management system has the potential to alter the reproductive output of sheep flocks and thereby farm profit. A study was conducted between 2006 and 2010 to evaluate the reproductive performance of four management systems with differing combinations of time of lambing, stocking rate and ram breed, while grazing at a similar midwinter stocking rate (dry-sheep equivalents per hectare of 8, 10.2, 13, 11.2 and 11.2 in the successive seasons 2006-2010). Three systems, winter lambing Merino (WLM), split lambing (SL) and later lambing (LL), grazed replicated farmlets comprising pastures that were 20% lucerne (Medicago sativa), 20% tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and 60% phalaris (Phalaris aquatica). A fourth system (high lucerne (HL)) grazed farmlets of 40% lucerne, 15% tall fescue and 45% phalaris. All systems used Merino ewes: in WLM mated to Merino rams, lambing in July; in SL half of the ewes lambing to terminal-breed rams in July, the other half lambing to Merino rams in September; and in LL and HL lambed in September, half to terminal-breed and half to Merino rams. The number of lambs weaned per ewe joined was 10% higher (P < 0.05) in the WLM system (0.99 +/- 0.03) than in the September-lambing systems LL and HL, largely a result of a higher number of fetuses per ewe and despite lower (P < 0.05) lamb survival to marking in some years. The SL system weaned a similar (P > 0.05) number of lambs per ewe (0.95 +/- 0.03) to all other systems. However, the number of lambs weaned per hectare was least in WLM (4.6 +/- 0.2), lower than in the HL and LL systems by 2.7 lambs/ha because of a lower stocking rate. The ranking of systems for fetal number and lamb survival was not consistent among years. Spring-lambing systems produced more lambs per hectare because of a higher stocking rate but fewer lambs per ewe than the WLM system. System differences in pregnancy rate, fecundity and lamb survival were not consistent between years.

Although a plethora of studies have elucidated the changes in Q(10) in farmland or natural ecosystems, the response of Q(10) to soil redistribution remains unclear. A simulated anthropogenic soil redistribution experiment by examining subsoil exposure (E-20) and topsoil addition (A(20)) was performed to explore the influences of soil organic matter (SOM) composition and r/K-shifts of microbial community on Q(10). Compared with the undisturbed soil, the average annual Q10 in the E-20 plot was significantly increased, whereas the mean annual Q(10) in the A(20) plot decreased. The ratios of C=C to COO and C=C to C=O, which indicate the stability of SOM, were significantly increased by 14.8% 44.2% and 33.9% 45.4% in the E20 plot but decreased by 18.6% 28.1% and 3.8% 11.2% in the A(20) plot, respectively. The ratios of oligotrophs to copiotrophs in both the bacterial and fungal communities were significantly increased in the E-20 plot (K-shift) but decreased in the A(20) plot (r-shift). The beta-D-xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase activities in the E-20 plot were significantly decreased but prominently increased in the A(20) plot, whereas the activity of polyphenol oxidase showed the opposite trend. The high aromaticity of recalcitrant SOM in the E-20 plot determined the prevalence of K-shift in the bacterial and fungal communities, which might be attributed to the production of enzymes that decompose recalcitrant SOM, which then further enhanced Q(10) and vice versa. Overall, our findings indicated that the feedback of ecological strategy of microbial community on the changes in SOM functional groups should be considered when evaluating the response of regional C cycling to anthropogenic soil redistribution.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				SEP	2022	223								105477	10.1016/j.still.2022.105477	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2022.105477		JUL 2022											WOS:000883425700007

Germplasm Using Diversity Array Technology and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Markers	PLANTS-BASEL												Knowledge of the genetic structure and diversity of germplasm collections is crucial for sustainable genetic improvement through hybridization programs and rapid adaptation to changing breeding objectives. The objective of this study was to determine the genetic diversity and population structure of 281 International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) soybean accessions using diversity array technology (DArT) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the efficient utilization of these accessions. From the results, the SNP and DArT markers were well distributed across the 20 soybean chromosomes. The cluster and principal component analyses revealed the genetic diversity among the 281 accessions by grouping them into two stratifications, a grouping that was also evident from the population structure analysis, which divided the 281 accessions into two distinct groups. The analysis of molecular variance revealed that 97% and 98% of the genetic variances using SNP and DArT markers, respectively, were within the population. Genetic diversity indices such as Shannon's diversity index, diversity and unbiased diversity revealed the diversity among the different populations of the soybean accessions. The SNP and DArT markers used provided similar information on the structure, diversity and polymorphism of the accessions, which indicates the applicability of the DArT marker in genetic diversity studies. Our study provides information about the genetic structure and diversity of the IITA soybean accessions that will allow for the efficient utilization of these accessions in soybean improvement programs, especially in Africa.

The specific nano-treatment can improve the distribution and properties of biochar (e.g., increase the specific surface area). To investigate the migration processes of runoff, sediment and nutrients on the nano-biochar (NB) applied sloping land during rainfall events, different mass content of NB (0.0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 0.7%, and 1.0%) were used on the three types of vegetation covered sloping land (bare, caragana, and maize). The effects of NB and vegetation on runoff volume, sediment yield, and nitrate loss were studied under simulated rainfall in the northeastern region of the Loess Plateau. The main results were as follows: the application of NB effectively reduced runoff (39.7-74.4%), sediment yield (8.9-41.8%), and nitrate loss (13.6-59.8%) in all treatments. Losses of nitrate in runoff and sediment were negatively correlated with increased content of NB (when NB application rate was 1.0%, the maximum nitrate loss in runoff and sediment were 27.43 and 6.25 mg, respectively). The equivalent model of convection was more suitable for analyzing the nutrient transfer process with the application of NB. The effective mixing depth decreased with NB content and could be well described by a power function. NB might promote the nitrate migrate to deep soil and reduce nitrate loss in runoff and sediment. With NB application, the peak value of nitrate distribution in the profile moved downward, and the maximum value was obtained at 10-15 cm. Moreover, the most effective NB content for reducing nitrate loss were 1.0%. Comparing with bare and maize, caragana had the most significant effect on reducing runoff, sediment and nutrient loss. In addition, Synergistic effect of NB and caragana showed the great potential on soil and water loss control. The findings in this study provide an efficient and economic method for controlling soil erosion and nutrient loss on the Chinese Loess Plateau.

Within the soil profile, salinity is a dynamic indicator and significantly changes with depth. The present study examined the effects of the vertical heterogeneity of soil salinity chemistry on the plant height, fresh and dry biomass accumulation, water content, level of genetic polymorphism, and observed and expected heterozygosity in seven populations of halophyte Bassia prostrata in natural habitats. Soil salinity ranged from slight (S-salts = 0.11-0.25%) to extreme (S-salts = 1.35-2.57%). The main contributors to salinity were Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. Multivariate analysis revealed that biomass accumulation is positively affected by moderate/high salinity in 20-60 cm soil layers, which may be associated with the salt required for the optimal growth of the halophyte B. prostrata. The formation of seed genetic diversity is negatively affected by slight/moderate salinity in the 0-40 cm layers. An increase in divalent ion content can reduce genetic diversity and increase the local adaptation of B. prostrata to magnesium-calcium sulfate salinity. The effect of the in-depth distribution of soil salinity on productivity and genetic diversity may be related to seasonal variables during biomass accumulation (summer) and seed formation (autumn).

Ignacio; Perez-Escobar, Oscar A.; Krasnov, Boris R.; Antonio Balbuena, Juan			Rtapas: An R Package to Assess Cophylogenetic Signal between Two Evolutionary Histories	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY												Cophylogeny represents a framework to understand how ecological and evolutionary process influence lineage diversification. The recently developed algorithm Random Tanglegram Partitions provides a directly interpretable statistic to quantify the strength of cophylogenetic signal and incorporates phylogenetic uncertainty into its estimation, and maps onto a tanglegram the contribution to cophylogenetic signal of individual host-symbiont associations. We introduce Rtapas, an R package to perform Random Tanglegram Partitions. Rtapas applies a given global-fit method to random partial tanglegrams of a fixed size to identify the associations, terminals, and internal nodes that maximize phylogenetic congruence. This new package extends the original implementation with a new algorithm that examines the contribution to phylogenetic incongruence of each host-symbiont association and adds ParaFit, a method designed to test for topological congruence between two phylogenies, to the list of global-fit methods than can be applied. Rtapas facilitates and speeds up cophylogenetic analysis, as it can handle large phylogenies (100+ terminals) in affordable computational time as illustrated with two real-world examples. Rtapas can particularly cater for the need for causal inference in cophylogeny in two domains: (i) Analysis of complex and intricate host-symbiont evolutionary histories and (ii) assessment of topological (in)congruence between phylogenies produced with different DNA markers and specifically identify subsets of loci for phylogenetic analysis that are most likely to reflect gene-tree evolutionary histories.

Despite the vital role of microelements in life chemistry and ecosystem functioning, little is known about how plant microelement concentrations, especially their bioconcentration factors (BCFs, the ratio of plant to soil concentration of elements), respond to large-scale environmental gradients, such as aridity, soil properties and anthropogenic activities, in drylands. The aim of the present study was to fill this important gap. We determined leaf microelement BCFs by measuring the concentrations of Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn in soils from 33 sites and leaves of 111 plants from 67 species across the drylands of China. Leaf microelement concentrations were maintained within normal ranges to satisfy the basic requirements of plants, even in nutrient-poor soil. Aridity, soil organic carbon (SOC) and electrical conductivity (EC) had positive effects, while soil pH had a negative effect on leaf microelement concentrations. Except for Fe, aridity affected leaf microelement BCFs negatively and indirectly by increasing soil pH and SOC. Anthropogenic activities and soil clay contents had relatively weak impacts on both leaf microelement concentrations and BCFs. Moreover, leaf microelement concentrations and BCFs shifted with thresholds at 0.89 for aridity and 7.9 and 8.9 for soil pH. Woody plants were positive indicator species and herbaceous plants were mainly negative indicator species of leaf microelement concentrations and BCFs for aridity and soil pH. Our results suggest that increased aridity limits the absorption of microelements by plant leaves and enhances leaf microelement concentrations. The identification of indicator species for the response of plant microelements to aridity and key soil characteristics revealed that woody species in drylands were more tolerant to environmental changes than herbaceous species.

Incident radiation is one of the key factors influencing LUE and SIFyield. In this study, to investigate the influence of PAR on LUE and SIFyield, pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry was carried out at the leaf level along with tower-based continuous SIF-GPP measurements at the canopy level for maize. LUE was found to decrease as PAR increased, following a hyperbolic function, at both the leaf level (R-2 = 0.978) and canopy level (R-2 = 0.460 for half-hourly averaged dataset; R-2 = 0.341 for daily averaged dataset). However, the variation of SIFyield with PAR was found to be very small. By integrating the influence of PAR on LUE, the GPP estimation model based on the red band and near-infrared (NIR) band SIF for maize became more linear. For both the half-hourly and daily datasets, the values of R-2 for the SIF-GPP model increased (e.g. from 0.573 to 0.718 for the half-hourly NIR band SIF), and the RMSE for the estimated GPP reduced (e.g. from 8.30 to 6.75 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) for the half-hourly NIR band SIF). These results highlight that the ratio of LUE to SIFyield is an important source of uncertainty in SIF-GPP models and should be carefully corrected. The results also show that PAR is a key factor influencing this ratio. This PAR-based LUE model can be integrated not only in SIF-GPP models but also in other LUE-related GPP estimation models for unstressed maize.

J	Lei, N; Han, JC				Lei, Na; Han, Jichang			Effect of precipitation on respiration of different reconstructed soils	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Respiration and hydrothermal characteristics of four reconstructed soils in barren gravel land at a site in Shaanxi Province were monitored before, during, and after two precipitation events. Both precipitation events significantly reduced soil temperature but there were great fluctuations in temperature after the second precipitation event. Moreover, precipitation increased the moisture content of the reconstructed soils. Before the first precipitation event, the soil volumetric water content was relatively stable, while it gradually decreased before the second precipitation event. The first precipitation event significantly stimulated the respiration rate for all reconstructed soils, while the second precipitation event generally inhibited it, especially during the precipitation event. The key factors influencing respiration for different reconstructed soils were different between the precipitation events. When soil volumetric water content showed persistent variation before precipitation, soil moisture was the most influential factor. In contrast, if water content was stable, soil temperature was more influential. Soil moisture and temperature jointly influenced soil respiration before, during, and after the precipitation event, while soil moisture was always the most influential factor after precipitation.																			2045-2322					APR 30	2020	10	1							7328	10.1038/s41598-020-63420-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63420-x								32355174					WOS:000559954900005

Little is known about age structure and self-thinning of poisonous dicotyledonous forbs in the alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau. We selected four poisonous dicotyledonous species, namely Anaphalis lacteal, Stellera chamaejasme, Pedicularis kansuensis, and Gentiana straminea, and determined their age structures by using number of branches, crown diameters, and plant heights and their self-thinning by using dry weights and different components (branches, leaves, and inflorescences). The populations of the four species were pyramid shaped with a rich seedling and juvenile base, which demonstrated a strong ability to increase in number rapidly and adapt to the environment. The Godron index indicated that the stability of age structures of the four species were A. lacteal > S. chamaejasme > G. straminea > P. kansuensis. Significant self-thinning was exhibited by branches of A. lacteal, branches and leaves of S. chamaejasme, and inflorescences of P. kansuensis. The self-thinning exponents from the allometric relationships between biomass and density differed at the level of branches, leaves, and inflorescences in the four poisonous forbs. We concluded that the populations of the four poisonous species were stable and able to increase in number rapidly on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. (c) 2022 The Society for Range Management.

The mean TDFs between diet and hair (expressed as delta C-13/delta N-15) were 2.14 parts per thousand/3.44 parts per thousand for C3 plant-based fodder and 2.65 parts per thousand/3.25 parts per thousand for fodder with 30% animal (insect) matter in yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and 1.66 parts per thousand/4.67 parts per thousand for C3 plant-based fodder and 1.94 parts per thousand/4.49 parts per thousand for fodder with 30% animal (insect) matter in bank voles (Myodes glareolus). As compared with the diet, faeces were depleted in C-13 by about 0.75 parts per thousand and enriched in N-15 by about 2 parts per thousand. All bank voles and only half of yellow-necked mice had regrown hair at the end of the study (day 95). We analysed archived skins of those species and confirmed, that moult in bank voles is more intensive. Our results can be used for trophic studies of temperate-forest rodents and for meta-analyses on trophic discrimination.

Keeping these things in view, a field study was conducted during the two consecutive winter seasons (2013-2014 and 2014-2015) to assess the effect of best management practices (application of straw mulch, doses of lime and integrated nutrition) on production potential, quality and soil health in baby corn under the acidic soil of eastern Himalaya. Yields, economics and quality of baby corn were increased significantly with application of straw mulch @ 5 t ha(-1) as compared to without mulch. Yield of baby corn increases with increasing levels of liming up to 1.0 t ha(-1). Also, higher quality parameters were noted in same treatment. Application of 1.0 t lime ha(-1) also improved the soil fertility status after crop harvest. Baby cob, baby corn, green fodder and dry fodder yields was significantly higher with 100% RDF + 25% RDF (through farm yard manures as organic nitrogen ON). This treatment also improved nitrogen content, their uptake and protein content in baby corn, cob husk and green fodder compared to control. Economic parameters were significantly higher with applications of 100% RDF + 25% RDF (ON). Higher doses of integrated nutrition [100% RDF + 25% RDF (ON)] also enhanced the soil health. Thus, it may be concluded that baby corn should be grown with straw mulching and integrated nutrition of 100% RDF + 25% RDF (ON) along with liming of 1.0 t ha(-1) to achieve the higher productivity, quality and soil health under acidic soil of eastern Himalaya.

Hepper) in Indian Subtropics	ATMOSPHERE												The thermal environment of a crop is one of the prime factors enhancing growth and production by regulating its physiological processes at different phenophases. To study the impact of thermal regime on spring-summer-grown black gram (variety Pant Urd 31), an experiment was conducted with different sowing dates (from the first to the third week of March), soil application of cobalt (Co) and foliar sprays of potassium (K) and boron (B) in various combinations in the split-split plot design during 2020 and 2021. The first-week-of-March-sown crop recorded more accumulated growing degree-days (GDD), photothermal units (PTU) and heliothermal units (HTU) with a longer duration than the later sown crop. Higher daily mean temperature during the reproductive stage of the later sown crop compelled it to complete the phenophases earlier than the normally sown crop, leading to yield reduction. Soil application of Co at 4 kg ha 1 and foliar sprays of K at 1.25% and B at 0.2% mitigated the adversities of excess heat irrespective of sowing dates. Variations in GDD and HTU, respectively, explained variations of about 75.8% and 87.3% in the final dry matter accumulation and of 72.9% and 84.8% in seed yield through polynomial regressions in the respective years. The maximum mean thermal use efficiency (TUE) for biomass production (0.24 g m(-2)/degrees C/day(-1)) and seed yield (0.11 gm(-2)/degrees C/day(-1)) were observed with Co soil application and combined foliar sprays of K and B due to higher dry matter production or seed yield with lower heat units accumulation in the first sown crop.

Assessing the use of a drought-tolerant variety as adaptation strategy for maize production under climate change in the savannas of Nigeria	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The Decision Support System for Agricultural Technology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to quantify the impact of climate change on maize yield and the potential benefits of the use of drought-tolerant maize variety over non-drought tolerant variety in savanna ecological zones of Nigeria. Projections of maize yields were estimated for three locations representing different agro-climatic zones and soil conditions, in the mid-century (2040-2069) and end-century (2070-2099) under representative concentration pathways scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) against the baseline period (1980-2009). Relative to the baseline period, the ensemble Global Circulation Models (GCMs) predicted significant increase in minimum and maximum temperatures and seasonal rainfall across the sites. In the mid-century, ensemble GCMs predicted temperatures increase between 1.7-2.4 degrees C for RCP4.5 and 2.2-2.9 degrees C for RCP8.5. By end-century, the temperature increases between 2.2-3.0 degrees C under RCP4.5 and 3.9-5.0 degrees C under RCP8.5. Predicted seasonal rainfall increase between 1.2-7% for RCP4.5 and 0.03-10.6% for RCP8.5 in the mid-century. By end of century, rainfall is expected to increase between 2-6.7% for RCP4.5 and 3.3-20.1% for RCP8.5. The DSSAT model predictions indicated a negative impact on maize yield in all the selected sites, but the degree of the impact varies with variety and location. In the mid-century, the results showed that the yield of the non-drought tolerant maize variety, SAMMAZ-16 will decline by 13-19% under RCP4.5 and 19-28% under RCP8.5. The projection by end-century indicates a decline in yield by 18-26% under RCP4.5 and 38-47% under RCP8.5. The yield of the drought-tolerant variety is projected to decline by 9-18% for RCP4.5 and 14-25% for RCP8.5 in the mid-century and 13-23% under RCP4.5 and 32-43% under RCP8.5 by the end-century. The higher temperatures by both emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) were primarily shown to cause more yield losses for non-drought-tolerant variety than that of the drought-tolerant variety. There will be 1-6% less reduction in yield when drought-tolerant variety is used. However, the higher yield reductions in the range of-13 to-43% predicted for the drought-tolerant variety by the end of the century across the study areas highlighted the need to modify the maize breeding scheme to combine both tolerances to drought and heat stresses in the agro-ecological zones of northern Nigeria.

One of the interesting solar cell structures is the fully mesoporous-carbon-based perovskite solar cells. The mesoporous layers can be fabricated entirely by screen printing with the potential for upscaling. Herein, the two-step deposition of perovskite in mesoporous-carbon-based perovskite solar cells is studied. The influence of the dipping time on the photovoltaic parameters is investigated using charge extraction and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements. A power conversion efficiency of 15% is observed for cells fabricated using two-step deposition which is one of the highest reported for this solar cell structure. Stability characterizations at maximum power point (MPP) tracking show degradation with time, however a complete recovery of the devices in the dark is revealed. Analyzing the mechanism for this shows that the perovskite's unit cell shrinks during the recovery process due to internal stress relief. This interesting phenomenon opens the possibility to optimize the stability of these solar cells for commercial applications.

J	Su, BQ; Shangguan, ZP				Su, Bingqian; Shangguan, Zhouping			Patterns and driving factors of water and nitrogen use efficiency in <i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i> L. on the Loess Plateau in China	CATENA												Water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) demonstrates the competitive strategies of plants with limited resources, which is important in mediating survival productivity and fitness of plants. Previous studies have found that there is a trade-off relationship between WUE and NUE and that they are affected by many factors, such as climate variables, geographical variables and soil properties. However, the patterns of WUE and NUE in Robinia pseudoacacia on the Loess Plateau are unclear and their driving factors need to be investigated to advance our knowledge of these key parameters to understand the coupling of carbon, nitrogen and water cycle. In this study, we calculated the WUE and NUE in Robinia pseudoacacia along a precipitation transect on the Loess Plateau and examined the effects of influencing factors on WUE and NUE. Our results showed that WUE varied from 64.03 to 103.08 mu mol mmol(-1), and NUE varied from 11.26 to 18.19 gC g(-1)N. Latitude played a substantial role in WUE, and soil nitrogen (ammonium nitrogen and total nitrogen) played a substantial role in NUE. In addition, NUE in Robinia pseudoacacia was lower than the average value of whole plants on the Loess Plateau, and the growth of Robinia pseudoacacia was mainly restricted by phosphorus. By dividing into three zones, zone 3 had higher WUE in where with higher latitude and lower precipitation, and NUE was not significant among the three zones. These results highlight the importance of location variables and soil chemical properties to WUE and NUE and provide useful information for understanding the coupling of carbon, nitrogen and water cycle of plants in ecosystems.						zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310													0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2020	195								104790	10.1016/j.catena.2020.104790	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.104790													WOS:000580366300039

Selective transport of soil organic and inorganic carbon in eroded sediment in response to raindrop sizes and inflow rates in rainstorms	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The soil carbon (C) reservoir involves soil organic and inorganic carbon stocks. The influence of soil erosion processes on soil organic carbon (SOC) migration has been investigated in the literature, but the influence on soil inorganic carbon (SIC) remains uncertain. Variations in the proportion of SOC and SIC in eroded sediment can influence C cycling, so we conducted a detailed laboratory study to investigate the selective transport of SOC and SIC in eroded sediment in treatments with different raindrop sizes and inflow rates. We used the boosted regression trees (BRT) models to estimate the SOC and SIC contents according to the ratio of flow depth and raindrop diameter (h/D), the maximum shear stress (tau*(max)), the runoff rate, the stream power (omega), the sediment concentration (SC), the soil loss rate (SLR), and various particle-related factors, including D50, D[4,3], D[3,2], clay content, silt content and sand content of non-dispersed sediment. The BRT model explained 42.1% and 56.1% of the variation in the SOC and SIC contents in the sediment, respectively. The relative importance of particle-related factors was approximately 50%, demonstrating that the particle size distribution (PSD) of sediment was a crucial factor for both SOC and SIC transport. The SOC content was sensitive to the presence of fine particles, while the SIC content was largely determined by coarse particles because smaller particles with a higher specific surface area tended to adsorb more SOC whereas coarser particles contained more carbonates in the form of binding agents. In sediment under intensive rainfall on steep slopes, the SOC tended to be depleted, while the SIC was slightly enriched. Our study demonstrates that both SIC and SOC were selectively transported by water erosion and fills gaps in this field of research. Moreover, this work implies that the PSD of the sediment provides important information about the variation in SOC and SIC and should be considered when modelling the global C cycle.

J	You, YL; Song, P; Yang, XL; Zheng, YP; Dong, L; Chen, J				You, Yongliang; Song, Ping; Yang, Xianlong; Zheng, Yapeng; Dong, Li; Chen, Jing			Optimizing irrigation for winter wheat to maximize yield and maintain high-efficient water use in a semi-arid environment	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Optimizing irrigation scheduling is vital in maintaining high crop yield and sustainable water use in waterlimited regions worldwide. In this study, a 4-year field experiment (2016-2020) was conducted to evaluate the effect of six irrigation schedules on the grain yield performance, soil water content, plant evapotranspiration, and irrigation water use efficiency of typical winter wheat production system in the North China Plain. The six irrigation schedules involved irrigation at different growth stages, including one critical growth stage (60 mm per stage, I60), two stages (I120), three stages (I180), four stages (I240), and five stages (I300). No irrigation was performed in the control field (I0). The results showed that the plant height and yield components of winter wheat (spike number per hectare, kernels per spike, thousand-kernel weight) increased with the increase in annual irrigation amount. The grain yield in each study year increased quadratically (P < 0.05) with the annual irrigation amount. The soil water content in the 0-90 cm soil layer (where the wheat roots are mainly distributed) increased significantly during the growing season with the increase in annual irrigation amount. In I240, the mean soil water content (0-90 cm) during the growing seasons (17.3-22.6 %) was 61.7-80.8 % of the field water holding capacity, sufficiently favoring wheat growth. The average soil water storage (0-90 cm) during the wheat growing season ranged from 241.1 to 283.2 mm in the irrigation applied treatments, which were 21.7-63.8 mm (9.9-29.1 %) higher than in no irrigation treatment (I0, 219.4 mm). The 4-year averages of wheat grain yield did not differ significantly between I240 (7909.1 kg ha-1) and I300 (7868.6 kg ha-1); however, the average irrigation water use efficiency decreased from 33.0 kg ha-1 mm-1 in I240 to 26.2 kg ha-1 mm-1 in I300. Therefore, we recommend an irrigation scheduling at the regreening, jointing, flowering, and filling stages (I240, 60 mm per stage, 240 mm in total) to maintain high grain yield and sustainable soil water use for winter wheat production in the North China Plain and similar semi-arid regions.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 1	2022	273								107901	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107901		AUG 2022											WOS:000861238500002
J	Li, JW; Shangguan, ZP; Deng, L				Li, Jiwei; Shangguan, Zhouping; Deng, Lei			Dynamics of soil microbial metabolic activity during grassland succession after farmland abandonment	GEODERMA												Secondary succession has a major influence on vegetation and soil biogeochemical processes, however, the dynamics of microbial metabolic activity and the driving factors during grassland succession after farmland abandonment remain unclear. Therefore, we examined variations in microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), soil basal respiration (BR), microbial quotient (Cmic:Corg), and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) in sloping farmlands that had been abandoned for 0, 3, 8, 13, 18, 23 and 30 years on the Loess Plateau in China. Moreover, the plant, soil and microbial properties were determined to reveal the forces driving soil microbial metabolic activity. The results showed that compared to those of farmland, the Cmic significantly increased by 104.7% and 168.0%, while the qCO(2) significantly decreased by 54.3% and 70.5%, respectively, in the late succession stages (23 and 30 years). Long-term succession (30 years) significantly enhanced the Cmic:Corg by 51.4%. In contrast, except for a decrease at 8 years, the BR changed little during grassland succession following farmland abandonment. These changes in microbial metabolic activity indicators were associated with shifts in litter biomass, soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, and soil fungi. Litter biomass and fungi were strongly affected the changes in microbial metabolic activity. This study provided new information regarding the dynamics of microbial metabolic activity during long-term secondary succession and enhanced our understanding of the linkages among plant, soil and microorganisms in semiarid ecosystems.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564													0016-7061	1872-6259				APR 1	2020	363								114167	10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.114167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.114167													WOS:000515198500027

In addition, this practice can help retain soil moisture and slow down the rainfall runoff rate, particularly on sloping farmland. This study uses laboratory experiments with a silt loam soil to examine the effects of wheat straw incorporation into cultivated farmland soil on rainfall-runoff. The experiments involved four straw incorporation rates (0 (control), 2, 4, and 8 t/ha), three rainfall intensities (80, 120 and 160 mm/h) and three slope gradients (10, 15 and 20 degrees), carried out by a completely randomized combination design, with three repetitions. In all the experimental runs, the total rainfall amount was 100 mm per event. Our experimental results showed that the duration of runoff initiation time at straw incorporation rates of 2, 4 and 8 t/ha were increased by 1.63% to 104.93%, 6.16% to 111.67% and 15% to 141.25%, while the total runoff amounts decreased by 11.74% to 28.81%, 24.21% to 49.67% and 38.90% to 65.93%, compared with those of our control group (0 t/ha). The effects of straw incorporation on the runoff initiation delay time and runoff reduction were significant, particularly when the rainfall intensity was 120 mm/h and the slope was 10 degrees. With increases in rainfall intensity and slope gradient, the runoff initiation time durations were decreased and the runoff rate increased. In conclusion, incorporating wheat straw into the farmland soil can delay the runoff initiation time and reduce runoff volume, to significantly increase rainwater storage into soil, thereby increasing the rainwater utilization rate and to benefit soil erosion control. This study can provide a data basis for farmland soil and water conservation research and practice.

We questioned how the mound-building ant,Camponotus herculeanus, affects the above-ground vegetation, the soil seed bank and physico-chemical properties of the soil. Location An alpine meadow in the northeast margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (37 degrees 40 ' N, 102 degrees 32 ' E), China. Methods We used field and greenhouse studies to determine the above-ground vegetation parameters and soil physico-chemical properties, and the soil seed bank composition under the mound (UM), the herbage circle at about 10 cm width around the outside of the mound (mound edge, ME) and the area 1 m from the center of the mound (control). Results (a) The mound edge had higher vegetation height, greater above-ground biomass, lower vegetation coverage and lower plant richness than controls; (b) Gramineae had a higher total importance value, which was based on the height, coverage and biomass of each plant species, and composed a higher biomass proportion in the mound edge than in controls (68% vs. 38%), while most of the perennial dicotyledons were restricted to the controls; (c) dicotyledons were the main seed group in the 0-8 cm layer of soil(UM)(43%), soil(ME)(51%) and soil(control)(60%), while Gramineae had a significantly higher seed density and percentage of total seeds in the soil(UM)(16,507 +/- 2,882.7 seeds/m(3), 28.1%) than in the soil(control)(4,200 +/- 799.5 seeds/m(3), 10.2%); and (d) soil in the 0-8 cm layer under the mound had lower water content and lower bulk density than soil on the mound edge and in controls. Conclusions Mound-building activity ofCamponotus herculeanusincreased the proportion of Gramineae and decreased the proportion of dicotyledons at the site of the study indicating, that mound building could enhance the transformation of a grass and sedges community to mainly a grass community in the alpine meadow.																			1100-9233	1654-1103				SEP	2020	31	5					867	876		10.1111/jvs.12907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvs.12907		JUL 2020											WOS:000546406300001

Bioactive Peptides from African Yam (AVIAIMF and GPADPF) and Taro (NGDF and NGNW) Reveal Multifunctional Antidiabetic Effects Using Biochemical and Cellular Models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEPTIDE RESEARCH AND THERAPEUTICS												The multifactorial nature of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has driven a need to discover multifunctional antidiabetic peptides preferably from functional food sources for possible application as antidiabetic supplements. Herein, the antidiabetic effects of bioactive peptides previously identified in yam (AVIAIMF & GPADPF) and taro (NGDF & NGNW) were investigated. The peptides showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitory activities than vildagliptin with NGDF having the best activity. AVIAIMF, GPADPF, and NGNW significantly inhibited the formation of methylglyoxal-induced advanced glycosylated end products (AGEs) while AVIAIMF and NGNW showed oxygen radical scavenging (ORAC) activities. The peptides also showed significant (p < 0.05) nitric oxide (NO) scavenging activities in murine macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells and were not cytotoxic to the RAW 264.7 cells in the presence and absence of lipopolysaccharide. The peptides did not show a biologically significant inhibition of lipid formation in 3T3-LI adipocytes and were not cytotoxic to human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells, suggesting safety. The ORAC negatively correlated (- 0.40) with % AGEs formed and positively correlated (0.53 and 0.41) with the viability of LPS + and LPS- RAW 264.7 cells respectively. AVIAIMF, GPADPF and NGNW have shown promising multifunctional anti-T2DM activities that could be considered as potential antidiabetic peptides for application in functional antidiabetic foods.

However, uncertainty exists regarding the distribution of soil C and N along slopes of various vegetation types. To examine differences in soil C and N on the slope, this study selected three vegetation restoration types of grasslands (Artemisia sacrorum and Artemisia capillaris), shrublands (Caragana korshinskii) and forestlands (Robinia pseudoacacia) with five slope positions (top, upper, middle, lower, and foot). The results showed that the distribution of soil C and N were regulated by the vegetation type. Soil C and N stocks in grasslands and shrublands increased from the top to the foot slope, but this pattern was not observed in forestlands. The lowest coefficients of variation (CVs) of soil C and N along the slope were observed in the shrublands, with the highest soil C (17.0 Mg ha(-1)) and N (1.9 Mg ha(-1)) stocks on the entire slope. The primary factors influencing soil C and N distribution along the slope differed depending on the vegetation type. The primary factors influencing soil C and N in grassland slopes were pH and belowground biomass C/N, while those in shrublands and forestlands were pH, litter biomass C/N, and soil inorganic N (NH4+ and NO3-). Moreover, variations in mineral-associated organic C and mineral-associated organic N dominated the soil C and N dynamics. This study showed that vegetation types regulated the distribution of soil C and N throughout the slope. The shrublands were the optimal vegetation type on the entire slope, which can help in boosting soil C and N stocks in Central Loess Plateau.

J	Su, BQ; Shangguan, Z				Su, Bingqian; Shangguan, Zhouping			Response of water use efficiency and plant-soil C:N:P stoichiometry to stand quality in <i>Robinia</i> <i>pseudoacacia</i> on the Loess Plateau of China	CATENA												The evaluation of stand quality is of great significance for forest management and sustainable development. Water use efficiency (WUE) and the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) stoichiometric characteristics of plants and soil are important indexes used to evaluate plant water and nutrients adaptation strategies. However, little is known about the effects of stand quality on WUE and plant soil C:N:P stoichiometry. In this study, the growth characteristics of Robinia pseudoacacia plantations and understory plants in an age series of 8-, 15-, 25-, and 35-year-old stands were investigated, and the leaf-level WUE and C:N:P stoichiometry in plants and soil were measured on the Loess Plateau. The results showed that the species richness, Shannon-Weiner diversity index, and evenness index reached their peaks in the 35-year-old stands with increasing afforestation age. WUE reached its highest value in the 35-year-old stands but was only significantly higher than that in the 8-year-old stands. Stand age had different effects on C, N, and P nutrients and stoichiometry in leaves, fine roots, and soil. The most obvious trend was that soil total P decreased significantly with increasing afforestation age, and the leaf N:P ratio was greater than 16 in the four stand ages, which indicated that P was the main limiting factor in R. pseudoacacia plantations. Leaf nutrients and stoichiometry are closely related to forest growth characteristics, while root nutrients and stoichiometry are more related to understory plant composition and diversity. Importantly, the WUE had no significant change with the increase in the stand quality index, and the response of soil stoichiometry to stand quality was stronger than that of plant stoichiometry. These results help us further understand coordinated plant-soil restoration after afforestation.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				NOV	2021	206								105571	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105571		JUL 2021											WOS:000688449100078

Although a number of studies have focused on the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool under soil redistribution, few studies have comprehensively assessed the effects of soil redistribution on the ecosystem carbon pool. A five-year experiment of simulated topsoil redistribution (removal and addition, R-A) was conducted to explore the effects of soil redistribution on soil CO2 emissions, the SOC pool and the plant C pool in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China. The soil properties, soil CO2 emissions, and crop parameters were measured after the topsoil removal (R-20) treatment and topsoil addition (A(20)) treatment and in the undisturbed control (CK). Our results showed that 1) compared with the undisturbed control, the mean soil CO2 emissions of the R-A treatment decreased by 8% while the mean SOC pool increased by 3.0%; 2) the plant C pool was significantly reduced by 53.8% in 2015 and 5.8% in 2019 compared with the undisturbed control; 3) the ecosystem C pool (the sum of the SOC pool and plant C pool) of the R-A treatment was reduced by 10.3%, 3.7% and 1.1% compared with the ecosystem C pool of the undisturbed CK for 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, but increased by 0.6% and 1.9% from 2018 to 2019. During the first three experimental years, the decrease in the ecosystem C pool of the R-A treatment was caused by the reduced plant C pool in R-20 exceeding the elevated plant C pool in A(20). Over time, the soil bulk density (BD) decreased in R-20 and the SOC, microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and total nitrogen (TN) increased, which jointly improved the plant C pool in R-20 and the ecosystem C pool by 2019. The gradual recovering pattern of the ecosystem C pool in the later years highlights the key role of plants in restoring soil properties and stabilizing ecosystem C cycling. Overall, our findings highlight that any attempt to assess the net impacts of soil redistribution, whether as a sink or source for atmospheric CO2, should comprehensively consider the changes in the SOC pool and plant C pool.

Within-site drivers for soil nutrient variability in plantation forests: A case study from dry sub-humid New Zealand	CATENA												Precise spatial information on soil properties in plantation forests is needed to improve soil nutrient management and to sustain productivity. Soil nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, organic matter, carbon and boron are important determinants and indicators of soil fertility and quality. Particularly in forests, these soil properties are highly variable in space and time. In this study, soils were sampled from three plantation forest sites in a dry sub-humid region near Blenheim, New Zealand. Thirty sampling points were selected, and samples were collected from the three sites across a range of slope and aspect strata. Soil samples were analysed for total carbon (totC), total nitrogen (totN), total phosphorus (totP), extractable potassium (exK) and hot-water extractable boron (exB). All examined soil properties varied significantly (p < 0.05) within sites. A set of fine-scale (5 m resolution) topographic surfaces, that might explain this variability, were then interpolated or derived in geographic information system software. Topographic surfaces included elevation, aspect, slope, profile and plan curvature, topographic position index (TPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), wind exposition index (WEI), and morphometric protection index (MPI). A generalised linear mixed-effect model was applied to develop predictive models. The study found all soil properties were positively correlated with MPI and negatively correlated with the WEI. This indicated that soil properties were correlated with shelter from surrounding relief and wind. Interestingly, within-site boron levels were correlated with both profile curvature (PrCurv) and topographic wetness index, indicating boron movement through the surface with the movement of soil moisture. The modelling approach in this study has potential for application to sustainable management of plantation forests using spatially-precise estimates of soil fertility.

Climatic and hydrologic elements are among the primary factors controlling the dynamics of NPP at global and regional scales. Thus, understanding the interactions between them is of great importance for optimal ecosystem management. This study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal change in NPP and its responses to both climatic and hydrologic factors in a semiarid watershed-the Upper reach of the Wei River Basin (UWRB)-on the Loess Plateau, China. To this end, an integrated hydro-biogeochemical model (SWAT-DayCent) was applied to examine NPP during the period 1987-2016. The results show that the SWAT-DayCent performed well in simulating both the hydrologic and the biogeochemical components in this typical loess watershed. Though the basin average NPP increased slightly during the recent 30 years (1987-2016), the spatial distribution varied significantly in the region, with a relatively higher level in the southeastern and western parts and a lower level in the northern part. The strongly positive responses of major vegetations to precipitation indicate that precipitation was the dominant factor driving the ecosystem production, whereas warming may exert negative effects, especially in the southeastern part of the UWRB. Further, the strongly positive relationships between NPP and soil water/ET also suggest that the ecosystem production relied heavily on the water availability, indicating a tightly-coupled water-carbon cycle in this region. Overall, our findings are of great importance for identifying the key driving forces of the ecosystem production and the interaction between water and carbon cycles. The study may also aid policymakers in seeking better eco-environmental management when facing the climate change on the Loess Plateau.

However, the contribution of microbial necromass to soil aggregates has not been comprehensively studied because of the heterogeneity of microhabitats in different soil aggregates, especially in different ecosystems on a global scale. To address this gap, we conducted a global-scale meta-analysis to investigate the contribution of microbial necromass to carbon sequestration in aggregates and identify the climatic and soil factors that influence necromass carbon in aggregates. The database of fungal and bacterial necromass carbon was based on the glucosamine and muramic acid contents in microaggregates (< 250 & mu;m, 226 samples), medium macroaggregates (250-2000 & mu;m,132 samples), and macroaggregates (> 2000 & mu;m, 66 samples). On average, microbial necromass carbon in microaggregates, medium macroaggregates, and macroaggregates contributed 48.5 %, 40.9 %, and 42.5 % of aggregate carbon sequestration, respectively. The contribution of fungal necromass carbon was significantly higher than that of bacteria (average 30.9 % vs. 13.1 %, respectively). Meanwhile, the ratio of fungal to bacterial necromass carbon increased with the increasing aggregate size, from 2.68 (< 250 & mu;m) to 3.11 (250-2000 & mu;m) to 3.14 (> 2000 & mu;m) for micro, medium size, and macroaggregates, respectively. In addition, the screening method for aggregates and the type of land use significantly affected the contribution of microbial necromass to aggregate carbon sequestration. Specifically, grassland and dry sieving significantly increased the contribution of microbial necromass carbon to aggregate carbon. Finally, the results from PLS-PM showed that climatic factors regulated fungal and bacterial necromass carbon through soil pH, sand, and nutrients in aggregates, thereby enhancing the contribution of microbial necromass to aggregate carbon sequestration. In addition, fungal and bacterial necromass carbon improved with increasing carbon and nitrogen content of the aggregates. Furthermore, a lower soil pH seemingly stimulates the accumulation of fungal and bacterial necromass in soil aggregates. These findings emphasize that the contribution of microbial necromass carbon to aggregate carbon sequestration, especially fungal necromass carbon, is an important method for improving carbon sequestration in soil aggregates.

J	Li, JW; Shangguan, ZP; Deng, L				Li, Jiwei; Shangguan, Zhouping; Deng, Lei			Free particulate organic carbon plays critical roles in carbon accumulations during grassland succession since grazing exclusion	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Grazing exclusion is proposed as an effective strategy for to recover degraded grasslands and increase carbon accumulation. However, few studies have explored the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its components to grazing exclusion during long-term succession. In this study, we collected soils from sites with a chronosequence of ~33 years after grazing exclusion with randomized and replicated experiments in the temperate grasslands of the Loess Plateau, China. The contents of SOC, free particulate organic carbon (fPOC), occluded particulate organic carbon (oPOC), and mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC) and their driving factors in the 0-60 cm soil layer were examined in each grassland. The results showed that fPOC, oPOC, and MOC contents were significantly affected (P < 0.05) by grazing exclusion duration and soil depth. Soil fPOC, oPOC, POC, and MOC contents increased with exclusion time, but decreased with soil depth. SOC content was significantly improved since grazing exclusion for more than 26 years compared with that for active grazing grasslands. The fPOC played critical roles in promoting the SOC formation within the entire soil profile (0-60 cm depth). Across the sampled areas, we found a positive association between the concentrations of SOC and its fractions, and the input of litter to the topsoil (0-40 cm), and soil extracellular enzymes at greater depths (40-60 cm). Our results indicate the potential of grazing exclusion for promoting SOC accumulation in semiarid regions, and highlight the need to understand soil carbon stabilization mechanisms in both top- and subsoil under future climate change scenarios.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564													0167-1987	1879-3444				JUN	2022	220								105380	10.1016/j.still.2022.105380	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2022.105380		MAR 2022											WOS:000805959600004
J	Lu, XL; Liu, ZQ; Zhao, F; Tang, JW				Lu, Xiaoliang; Liu, Zhunqiao; Zhao, Feng; Tang, Jianwu			Comparison of total emitted solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF in estimating photosynthesis	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Many studies have shown that solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) has a good potential to predict gross primary production (GPP) of vegetation. What we measured by remote sensing or near-surface platforms is top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF (SIFtoc), which is not necessarily equal or proportional to total emitted SIF (SIFtot) from the entire canopy due to the (re)absorption and scattering effects. However, photosynthesis, the process that plants use to fix carbon from the atmosphere, occurs at the entire vertical canopy. Here, by using the recollision theory, we calculated SIFtot at 760 nm from the measured SIFtoc, hyperspectral reflectance (R), canopy interception (i) and leaf albedo (omega(l)). Among them, both SIFtoc and R can be obtained from concurrent TOC spectral measurements; i and omega(l) in the near-infrared region can be estimated from the open access datasets with a good accuracy. Our result confirms that the measured SIFtoc only accounts for a small fraction of SIFtot: the above-the-canopy sensor can only "see" on average 22.9% of SIFtot at Harvard Forest. SIFtot has the following advantages over SIFtoc in estimating GPP: (1) SIFtot improves the diurnal estimate of canopy GPP, especially capable to capture the midday depression of photosynthesis which may cause the large discrepancies between SIFtoc and GPP on a diurnal basis, (2) SIFtot produces a stronger correlation with GPP from plants with complex canopy structure or under sky conditions with more diffuse irradiance, and (3) the SIFtot-GPP relationship shows a stronger resilience to environmental stresses. The fluorescence escape ratio (f(esc)), the ratio between SIFtoc multiplied by pi and SIFtot, is mostly determined by the sun-canopy-sensor geometry and leaf inclination distribution. The effect of LAI and the leaf chlorophyll concentration on f(esc) is marginal at the 760 nm wavelength. Our results suggest that converting SIFtoc into SIFtot provides a better tool to understand and estimate GPP.

The soil infiltrability has significance in reducing runoff yield and soil loss. However, characterization of the soil infiltration capacity of planted grasslands, such as alfalfa (Medicago Sativa), with different growing years in this high-altitude alpine region is still lacking. In this study, the variation of soil infiltration rate and characteristics were analyzed in alfalfa grasslands with three growth years (two-, four- and seven-year-old). A corn cropland was used as the control field, and the infiltration was monitored using the automatic soil infiltrability measurement system. To determine the influence factors on infiltration rate (IR), soil characteristics and root dry weight density (RDWD) at 0-30 cm soil depth were measured. The results indicated that the comprehensive index of soil water infiltration capacity (FIR) of the seven-year-old alfalfa grassland (0.69) was the highest, followed by the two- (0.05) and four-year-old (0.11) grasslands, being these values significantly higher than that of the corn field (-0.85, P < 0.05). SWC was positively correlated with IR during the fast infiltration stage (IR-I). The soil bulk density and organic matter were negatively correlated with IR, while RDWD was positively related to IR. Our results showed that alfalfa planting improved soil infiltrability, and this upgrade increased with the age growth. This study provided significant information to introduce soil-erosion-control practices for alpine soil and highlights the importance of ecological function of planted grasslands in alpine area of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

However, our understanding of the long-term effects of N addition on microbial communities in the plant-soil system is still limited. Here, we used an Ion S5 (TM) XL sequencing platform to explore the structural and functional characteristics of root-associated bacterial communities in winter wheat (Triticum aestivium) under long-term N addition. The N fertilization experiment involved five treatments (0, 90, 180, 270, and 360 kg N ha(-1)) in a farmland ecosystem over 14 years. Bacterial communities shifted significantly with increasing N level in three soil-root compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere, and root interior) of wheat plants at two growth stages (jointing and filling). These shifts were associated with dynamic changes in soil properties, mainly pH, nitrate-N, and ammonium-N levels. There was a community shift between slow-growing oligotrophs and fast-grow copiotrophs with increasing N addition, indicating distinct survival strategies of bacteria across soil-root compartments and wheat growth stages. Potential biomarkers, including nitrifying, denitrifying, and N-fixing genera were identified to predict very high N concentration in each soil-root compartment. Significant variation was detected in the relative abundance of predicted functional genes related to N metabolism (denitrification, nitrification, and N fixation) across the three compartments, two growth stages, and five N levels. These results indicate that bacterial communities respond differentially to long-term high N input in the soil-root compartments of wheat plants during different growth stages.

J	Yan, WM; Zhong, YQW; Liu, J; Shangguan, ZP				Yan, Weiming; Zhong, Yangquanwei; Liu, Jin; Shangguan, Zhouping			Response of soil respiration to nitrogen fertilization: Evidence from a 6-year field study of croplands	GEODERMA												Agroecosystems receive large amounts of nitrogen (N), which can have a profound impact on soil respiration (Rs). Although Rs is the largest carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere, the potential effects of N fertilization on Rs and its components (heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and autotrophic respiration (Ra)) remain controversial, and information on the impacts of N fertilization on C emission from long-term experiments is lacking. In this study, we conducted a field experiment during 6 growing seasons (2012-2018) in which we applied N fertilizer at three rates (0, 180 and 360 kg N ha(-1), referred to as NO, N180 and N360, respectively) to two wheat varieties (Changhan No. 58 (CH) and Zhengmai No. 9023 (ZM)) and investigated the effects of N fertilization on Rs and its components by continuous half-hourly observations. We found that over the 6 growing seasons, N180 and N360 increased the mean growing season soil C emission by 29.7% and 11.6%, respectively, due to the increased C emission through Ra under fertilization, which was related to an increased leaf area index (LAI) and canopy photosynthesis (Pn). Significant seasonal variations in the Rs rate were observed; both Rh and Ra contributed to these variations, and the variations were significantly correlated with both soil and air temperature and plant-related traits (LAI and canopy Pn). In addition, the C emission through Rs during the growing season increased throughout the experiment, mainly because of an increase in C emissions through Rh that was caused by increasing temperature during the observation period due to climate change at the experimental site. However, C emission through Rs increased relatively rapidly under the N180 treatment due to the increased Rh throughout the experiment. Furthermore, interaction effects of soil moisture and temperature on the Rs rate and its components were also observed. Overall, our findings highlight the significance of N fertilization in term of soil C emission and its feedback under global warming in agroecosystems.

Net C balance of BSCs is strongly dependent on rainfall and consequent activation of microbes in the BSCs. The compensation-rainfall size for BSCs (the minimum rainfall amount for a positive net C balance) is assumed to be different with BSCs of different developmental stages. A field experiment with simulated rainfall amount (SRA) of 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mm was conducted to examine the C fluxes and compensation-rainfall size of BSCs in different parts of fixed dunes in the ecotone between the Badain Jaran Desert and the Minqin Oasis. We found algae-lichen crust on the interdunes and crest, algae crust on the leeward side, and lichen-moss crust on the windward. Even a small rainfall (1 mm) can activate both photosynthesis and respiration of all types of BSCs. The gross ecosystem production, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem exchange were significantly affected by SRA, hours after the simulated rainfall, position on a dune, and their interactions. The rapid activation of photosynthesis provides a C source and therefore could be responsible for the increase of C efflux after each rewetting. C-uptake and -emission capacity of all the BSCs positively correlated with rainfall size, with the lowest C fluxes on the leeward side. The compensation rainfall for a net C uptake was 3.80, 15.54, 8.62, and 1.88 mm for BSCs on the interdunes, the leeward side, the crest, and the windward side, respectively. The whole dune started to show a net C uptake with an SRA of 5 mm and maximized with an SRA of about 30 mm. The compensation-rainfall size is negatively correlated with chlorophyll content. Our results suggest that BSCs will be favored in terms of C balance, and sand dune stabilization could be sustained with an increasing frequency of 5-10 mm rainfall events in the desert-oasis transitional zone.

Categorical principal components analysis (CATPCA) has the potential to overcome these issues. Therefore, in order to investigate the suitability of CATPCA for spatial modeling, we conducted a case study based on the generation susceptibility of gully heads was determined, including 2310 gully head and 23 variables. CATPCA was first used in the spatial modeling of gully head generation. The first six principal components retained 76.4% of data trends. The area of the training and validation sensitivity curves were 75.4% and 75.7%, respectively, which reflected good levels. CATPCA can simulate gully head spatial differences, and thus, has great potential for spatial modeling applications. Among the 23 factors, elevation, distance to residential areas, human footprint, lithology, and soil type were identified as the main controlling factors affecting the generation susceptibility of gully heads, with high correlations between them. Low altitudes, close proximity to residential areas, high human footprint, and poor vegetation were associated with high susceptibility. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of the applicability of CATPCA for spatial modeling. CATPCA is a novel solution for spatial modeling strategies that can improve understanding and has great potential for various spatial modeling applications in the future.

Here, we used a combined transcriptomic and physiological approach to investigate the underlying mechanism of melatonin in mitigating chromium (Cr) toxicity in Zea mays L. Maize plants were treated with either melatonin (10, 25, 50 and 100 mu M) or water and exposed to 100 mu M K2Cr2O7 for seven days. We showed that melatonin treatment significantly decreased the Cr content in leaves. However, the Cr content in the roots was not affected by melatonin. Analyses of RNA sequencing, enzyme activities, and metabolite contents showed that melatonin affected cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis, glutathione (GSH) metabolism, and redox homeostasis. During Cr stress, melatonin treatment increased cell wall polysaccharide contents, thereby retaining more Cr in the cell wall. Meanwhile, melatonin improved the GSH and phytochelatin contents to chelate Cr, and the chelated complexes were then transported to the vacuoles for sequestration. Furthermore, melatonin mitigated Cr-induced oxidative stress by enhancing the capacity of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Moreover, melatonin biosynthesis-defective mutants exhibited decreased Cr stress resistance, which was related to lower pectin, hemicellulose 1, and hemicellulose 2 than wild-type plants. These results suggest that melatonin alleviates Cr toxicity in maize by promoting Cr sequestration, re-establishing redox homeostasis, and inhibiting Cr transport from the root to the shoot.

This study focuses on heavy metals in the hyporheic sediment of the Weihe River, China. Contamination levels of metals were examined by using "geo-accumulation index, enrichment factor, and contamination factor" while ecological risk of metals were determined by "potential ecological risk and risk index". The pollutant accumulation of metals ranked as follows: "manganese (Mn) > chromium (Cr) > zinc (Zn) > copper (Cu) > nickel (Ni) > arsenic (As) > lead (Pb)". The geo-accumulation index identified arsenic as class 1 (uncontaminated to moderate contamination), whereas Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb, and Mn were classified as class 0 (uncontaminated). According to the enrichment factor, arsenic originated through anthropogenic activities and Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb were mainly controlled by natural sources. The contamination factor elucidated that sediments were moderately polluted by (As, Cr, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Pb), whereas Ni slightly contaminated the sediments of the Weihe River. All metals posed a low ecological risk in the study area. The risk index revealed that contribution of arsenic (53.43 %) was higher than half of the total risk.

J	Sivan, D; Meron, E; Kinast, S				Sivan, Doron; Meron, Ehud; Kinast, Shai			Stability and bifurcation analysis of Generation IV reactors via point reactor models with temperature reactivity feedback	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY												While the stability of present-day reactors is well studied, stability analysis of Generation IV reactors is in its very beginning. In this paper, the stability of point nuclear reactor models with temperature reactivity feedbacks is analyzed. The examined models are referred to as G-L reactor models, which are point reactor models with G delayed neutron-emission groups, L temperature lumps (regions) and a linear reactivity feedback for each temperature. G-L reactor models are applicable for modeling four out of the six Generation IV reactor types (Gas Fast Reactor, Lead Fast Reactor, Sodium Fast Reactor and Very High Temperature Reactor).New analytical stability and bifurcation results of general G-L reactor models and of the G1-L2 reactor model are derived. These analytical results add a different perspective to the previous studies of Generation IV reactors, most of which are based only on numerical analysis. In particular, the codimension-1 bifurcations of general G-L reactor models are characterized, and a classification of the linear stability region in the G1-L2 model is derived.Then, stability and bifurcation analysis of a G1-L2 model of a Generation IV HTR-type microreactor is performed, using both analytical methods and the numerical continuation method. The nominal design point of this microreactor is shown to be globally asymptotically stable, while in other regions of the parameter space, a bistability of the operating steady state and a limit cycle, or of two limit cycles, is demonstrated.

Academic/practical relevance: We are the first to comprehensively study ad hoc and forward multiple-sourcing negotiations for food importing. Such problems are widespread, especially in developing nations, and thus the research can be relevant to the wellbeing of large underprivileged populations. Methodology: We develop an analytical negotiation model in the Nash bargaining framework and adopt the Nash-in-Nash framework to analyze multiple-sourcing negotiations. Results: We find that while forward negotiations are not necessarily better than ad hoc negotiations for the buyer, it would be true with sufficiently many suppliers. When facing a supplier pool, we show that it may be optimal to mix forward and ad hoc suppliers. In general, fewer suppliers should be assigned as ad hoc as the pool size increases. We also find that adding a hybrid supplier (engaged in a forward negotiation with an ad hoc negotiation as the fallback option) may be better or worse than adding a forward supplier in the presence of other suppliers. Managerial implications: Our findings inform how a food importer should strategically utilize ad hoc and forward negotiations with its suppliers to improve the outcome. The work may help countries' food importing policymaking and strategies and may improve the wellbeing of large underprivileged populations.

J	Ding, L; Fu, SH				Ding, Lin; Fu, Suhua			Effects of different types of undecomposed surface litter on the sediment transport capacity	GEODERMA												Plant litter cover affects the sediment transport capacity of overland flow, which, in turn, influences the prediction of the soil erosion. In previous studies, researchers focused on the differences in the hydraulic variables and soil erosion for different types of litter incorporated in the soil or present on the surface. The quantitative relationship between the litter morphology and sediment transport capacity on no-till systems with litter covered surfaces has not been examined yet. Therefore, in this study, the effects of different types of litter on the hydraulic variables and sediment transport capacity were examined, along with the quantitative relationships among the three aspects. To this end, one discharge magnitude (2.632 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1)), two slope gradients (8.8% and 26.8%), and five types of undecomposed surface litter (Populus simonii, Robinia pseudoacacia, 114)pophae rhamnoides, Pinus tabuliformis, and Bothriochloa ischaemum) were considered to conduct experiments in a steel flume bed. The coverage of each type of litter ranged from 0% to 70%. The results showed that the flow regime, hydraulic variables and sediment transport capacity were affected by the types of litter. The length, width-to-length ratio and roundness of the individual litter leaves could suitably reflect the impact of the litter morphology on the sediment transport capacity, as indicated by the high Pearson correlation coefficients (> 0.5). Long and narrow litter with a small roundness more notably reduced the sediment transport capacity than short and wide litter with a large roundness. The litter morphology did not influence the relationships between the sediment transport capacity and hydraulic variables. In particular, the hydraulic variables such as the unit stream power, flow velocity combined with slope gradient, and stream power combined with flow depth could accurately predict the sediment transport capacity (R-2 > 0.94), and the characteristic variables of the litter morphology and cover were not required to be considered in the prediction equation. The presented findings can be used to develop a simple algorithm to predict the sediment transport capacity of litter covered surfaces.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				MAR 1	2021	385								114842	10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114842	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114842													WOS:000609999200010

Sustainable development in East Africa: impact evaluation of regional agricultural development projects in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda	NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM												Investments in agricultural technologies, capacity building and policy harmonization are needed to support sustainable development across Africa. Regional development projects can facilitate the adoption of agricultural technologies and innovations across nation-state borders and generate benefits for shared prosperity. This paper uses panel data from 1,160 smallholder households including beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries from five countries in East Africa - Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. From a pool of over 90 projects implemented over a span of 15 years, 23 regional projects are included in this study. The major economic benefits to smallholder participants are higher crop productivity and income, access to adaptable technologies, access to markets, higher livestock and milk production, gender equality, enhanced food security, resilience and capacity building for uptake and scaling up of future innovation platforms. For example, the adoption of low-cost tissue culture banana by the beneficiaries increased their incomes by 15% in Rwanda while the adoption of appropriate land and water management technologies increased the potato yields from 2.8 tons (USD 2,840/ha) to over 7.5 tons (USD 7,410/ha) in Kenya. The beneficiaries ensured value added to commodities like bananas (for export) and orange-fleshed sweet potatoes (a nutrition-sensitive intervention for enhancing domestic intake of vitamin A) in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Additionally, milk production increased from 6 to 11 L per cow per day in Uganda and from 6 to 8 L per cow per day in Tanzania, with increases in sales generating USD 115 per cow per month above the non-beneficiaries. These results are supported by previous studies on technology adoption, investments in agriculture and well-being outcomes. Our findings with the higher farm income Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator for the female beneficiaries compared to male beneficiaries might have important implications for investing in regional development projects that will close the gender gap in agricultural productivity in Africa. Regional projects can also support post-conflict development efforts for food security and peace in fragile contexts such as in Burundi. Our findings might serve as an input to the African Union's Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, localization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals related to food security and agriculture in Africa and an input to monitoring, evaluation and learning.

Micro-watershed management by removing reservoir sediments and using them for reclaiming farmland, while using reservoir water for irrigation, can be a potential solution to simultaneously address soil and water constraints and food security challenges. Still, there is knowledge gap before such a solution can be practically applied. The objective of this paper is to present potential solutions for the reservoir sedimentation problem and specifically highlight the utility of bathymetric survey using an echo-sounder to assess sediment volume. Our results indicated that the estimated reservoir sediment volume was 6400 m(3) leading to a reclamation of 3.2 hectares by layering 0.2 m sediment. The sediment used for reclamation depicts neutral pH (7.3), high organic carbon (2.5%), available phosphorus (9.2 mg/kg) and exchangeable potassium (25 cmol(+)/kg). Garlic (Allium sativum) was planted in the reclaiming abandoned farmland and produced 7.1 t/ha of bulb on average. There is a potential of producing 2-3 horticultural crops per year. Thus, developing methods for scaling up potential farmland reclamation using reservoir sediment would contribute to degraded farmland restoration and food security in Ethiopia and beyond.

Bias-Dependent Dynamics of Degradation and Recovery in Perovskite Solar Cells	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS												Degradation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is often found to be partially or fully reversible when the cells are allowed to recover in the dark. Unlike the dynamics of degradation, knowledge about the dynamics of PSC cell recovery is very limited. Here, we demonstrate that the PSC recovery strongly depends on the electrical bias conditions during the light-induced degradation and that it can be manipulated by applying an external electrical bias during the recovery phase. Investigation of the recovery dynamics allows us to analyze the degradation mechanisms in detail. More specifically, we aged a mixed-cation mixed-halide PSC with a n-i-p structure under illumination in open-circuit (OC) or short-circuit (SC) conditions, and periodically measured their characteristics during the recovery. PSCs aged in SC degrade faster and fully recover after the light is switched off, while the performance of the cells aged in OC does not recover but instead further decreases after the light is switched off ("drop-in-dark" effect). With the use of transient photoluminescence, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and drift-diffusion-based simulations, we hypothesize that extrinsic ion migration causes the drop-in-dark effect, by forming an electron extraction barrier at the metal oxide electron transport layer. The applied bias alleviates this effect. Our results are relevant for gaining a deeper understanding of the multiple degradation mechanisms present in perovskite solar cells, and for finding a practical way to assist their recovery.

Regional-scale partitioning of transmission losses and groundwater recharge using satellite estimates of actual evapotranspiration in an arid environment	ECOHYDROLOGY												Rivers in arid regions often rely on flow generated from wetter regions upstream, leading to high transmission losses of downstream flows. These transmission losses support a range of ecosystems, but partitioning the volume of the transmission losses across the floodplain, riparian zone and in-channel is difficult. This study presents a methodology relying primarily on multi-decade satellite remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration estimates to partition these losses. The method was applied to the similar to 40,000 km(2) floodplain of Cooper Creek in the central Australian arid zone, where first, the alluvial landscape was classified based on actual evapotranspiration rates, and second, both regional- (i.e., for the entire floodplain) and local-scale (i.e., for each waterhole) water balances were calculated to partition these losses. Regional-scale results estimated that 82% of transmission losses occurred on the floodplain, 13% in the riparian zone and 5% from open water in the river channel and waterholes. These results showed that a refinement of the conceptual model of recharge from the waterholes is necessary as vast areas of the riparian zone are likely to be accessing a shallow freshwater lens rather than a discrete freshwater lens below the permanent waterholes. This method can be used in other data-poor arid river systems as it uses globally accessible data sources.

Genotyping-by-sequencing and multilocation evaluation of two interspecific backcross populations identify QTLs for yield-related traits in pigeonpea	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												This study has identified single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with nine yield-related traits in pigeonpea by using two backcross populations (BP) developed through interspecific crosses and evaluating them at two locations and 3 years. In both the populations, markers have shown strong segregation distortion; therefore, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping mixed model was used. A total of 86 QTLs explaining 12-21% phenotypic variation were detected in BP-1. On the other hand, 107 QTLs explaining 11-29% phenotypic variation were detected in BP-2. Although most QTLs were environment and trait specific, few stable and consistent QTLs were also detected. Interestingly, 11 QTLs in BP-2 were associated with more than one trait. Among these QTLs, eight QTLs associated with days to 50% flowering and days to 75% maturity were located on CcLG07. One SNP "S7_14185076" marker in BP-2 population has been found associated with four traits, namely days to 50% flowering, days to 75% maturity, primary branches per plant and secondary branches per plant with positive additive effect. Hence, the present study has not only identified QTLs for yield-related traits, but also discovered novel alleles from wild species, which can be used for improvement of traits through genomics-assisted breeding.

It is significantly influences on the ecological security and sustainable development of the region. Soil conservation (SC) service, as one of the most important regulating services provided by ecosystems, can alter soil and water processes and improve ecosystem services that ensure human welfare. Investigations of spatial and temporal characteristics of SC service play important roles in soil erosion control and ecosystem protection in AUMYR. In the past several years, restoration projects (e.g. the Grain-for-Green project) were implemented to improve SC in most of AUMYR. It is needed to evaluate the change of SC service brought about by the projects. This study carries out quantitative spatial analysis of SC services through Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) model and geographic information system (GIS) manipulation based on various datasets, such as remote sensing image, digital elevation model (DEM), climate, and land use/cover maps. Soil retention calculated as potential soil erosion (erosion without vegetation cover) minus actual soil erosion was applied as indicator for SC service. The results are like these. (1) The total amount and mean capacity of SC service in AUMYR were 7.22 billion t/a and 142.2 t/hm(2).a in 2000 and 10.19 billion t/a and 200.8 t/hm(2).a in 2010, respectively. South-east AUMYR exhibited a much higher capacity of soil retaining than the north-west. (2) Forest ecosystems displayed higher SC capacity than other types of ecosystems. Moreover, the SC capacity of ecosystems increased with the increasing of slope gradient. (3) Variations of SC rate (the ratio of SC to potential soil erosion in percentage) in different units (ecosystem, slope zone and city) were relatively small and ca. 90% of potentially eroded soil was retained in AUMYR. (4) The spatial characteristics of SC service in AUMYR were primarily controlled by topography at the regional scale. Vegetation cover restoration significantly improved the capacity of SC service in AUMYR in the midst year of 2000 and 2010. The results revealed that ecological restoration efforts significantly enhanced SC service of ecosystem in the study area.

It plays an important role in guiding policy makers to plan and implement adaptation practices to mitigate potential climate risks to crop. However, due to the diversity in the methodology of vulnerability assessment, there are still knowledge gaps in assessing and comparing crop vulnerability to climate in different regions of the world, including Australia.OBJECTIVE: Our main objectives were to: (1) present a vulnerability analytical method for wheat yield, which can be applied to different areas where long-term crop yield and climate data are available. (2) quantify temporal changes of the vulnerability of wheat yield to historical climate. (3) identify the most vulnerable region in study area to provide guidance for climate mitigation.METHODS: Our study developed an indicator-based method using exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to assess the vulnerability of crop yield. We used the long-term recorded wheat yield data, combining with comprehensive exposure index to assess climate vulnerability of historical yield with a case study area of south-eastern Australia's wheat belt.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that from the 1930s to the 1990s, both climate exposure and sensitivity had large inter-annual variations with no significant trends detected. However, adaptive capacity increased by 34% from 1930s to 1950s, 54% from 1950s to 1970s, and 54% from 1970s to 1990s. By contrast, climate vulnerability across the wheat belt decreased by 13% from 1930s to 1950s, 15% from 1950s to 1970s, and 33% from 1970s to 1990s. This is mainly due to increased adaptive capacity with the improvement of agronomic management practices, technological and socio-economic progress. We identified the areas with the highest vulnerability were in the northwestern parts of wheat belt while the least vulnerable areas located in the southeast.SIGNIFICANCE: We expect that these identified vulnerable hotspots can be used by different landholders to allocate natural resources and policymakers to plan the priority mitigation to adapt to climate change in the local scale. Moreover, the method of vulnerability assessment used in this study can be applied to other regions around the world where long-term crop yield and climate data are available.

Independent bioassays were performed including seed priming with AGE (0, 100, and 200 mu g center dot mL(-1)), germination under the allelochemical influence of AGE, DADS, and AAS, and germination under volatile application of AGE. Noticeable differences in germination indices and seedling growth (particularly root growth and fresh weights) were observed in a dose-dependent manner. When germinated under 50 mM NaCl, seeds primed with AGE exhibited induced defense via antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT)), lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde content (MDA)), and H2O2 scavenging. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent analysis (ELISA) of the endogenous phytohormones auxin (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinin (ZR), and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) in the roots and shoots of the obtained seedlings and the relative expression levels of auxin-responsive protein (IAA2), like-auxin (LAX5), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK7 and MPK2), respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH1), CHI3 and SODCC1 suggested allelopathic functions in stimulating growth responses. Our findings suggest that garlic allelochemicals act as plant biostimulants to enhance auxin biosynthesis and transportation, resulting in root growth promotion. Additionally, the relative expressions of defense-related genes, antioxidant enzymes activities and phytohormonal regulations indicate activation of the defense responses in tomato seedlings resulting in better growth and development. These results, thus, provide a basis to understand the biological functions of garlic allelochemicals from the induced resistance perspective in plants.

Yet, the effects of plant litter on sandy soil microbial activities and soil nutrients during the shrub and herb colonization process are still unclear. Here, contributions of plant litter to soil microbial activity improvement and soil nutrient enhancement along herb and shrub colonization expansion interfaces were studied in an arid sandy landscape. Plant litter mass, soil water content, pH, nutrient content, extracellular enzyme activities, and microbial community structure (taxon composition, alpha-diversity, 13-diversity, and co-occurrence pattern) of soils at depths of 0-10 cm were examined relative to the colonization processes of shrubs and herbs (shrub and herb vegetation-* sand-shrub and sand-herb interface-* a sand dune) in an arid sandy land. We found that the processes of both herb and shrub colonization significantly increased litter cu-mulative mass at the soil surface to soil depths of 5 cm, and shrub colonization contributed several folds more litter than herb colonization. Plant litter input significantly decreased soil pH, accelerated soil extracellular enzyme activities, increased abundances of some microbial phyla (Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Patescibacteria, Armatimonadetes, Ascomycota, Moritierellomycota, and Chytridiomycota), enhanced both prokaryotic and fungal alpha-diversities, altered both prokaryotic and fungal communities, and promoted complexity of microbial networks during both herb and shrub colonization. As a result, microorgan-isms actively participated in litter decomposition and soil nutrient enhancement. Nevertheless, shrub coloniza-tion process exhibited greater potential in nutrient input than herb colonization process due to its greater plant litter input, though both colonization played a comparable role in accelerating soil enzyme activity and improving soil microbial community diversity and co-occurrence. Therefore, xeromorphic shrubs are still more important plants than herbs should be used for vegetation construction and ecological restoration in arid sandy land.

Nitrogen fertilization weakens the linkage between soil carbon and microbial diversity: A global meta-analysis	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Soil microbes make up a significant portion of the genetic diversity and play a critical role in belowground carbon (C) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Soil microbial diversity and organic C are often tightly coupled in C cycling processes; however, this coupling can be weakened or broken by rapid global change. A global meta-analysis was performed with 1148 paired comparisons extracted from 229 articles published between January 1998 and December 2021 to determine how nitrogen (N) fertilization affects the relationship between soil C content and microbial diversity in terrestrial ecosystems. We found that N fertilization decreased soil bacterial (-11%) and fungal diversity (-17%), but increased soil organic C (SOC) (+19%), microbial biomass C (MBC) (+17%), and dissolved organic C (DOC) (+25%) across different ecosystems. Organic N (urea) fertilization had a greater effect on SOC, MBC, DOC, and bacterial and fungal diversity than inorganic N fertilization. Most importantly, soil microbial diversity decreased with increasing SOC, MBC, and DOC, and the absolute values of the correlation coefficients decreased with increasing N fertilization rate and duration, suggesting that N fertilization weakened the linkage between soil C and microbial diversity. The weakened linkage might negatively impact essential ecosystem services under high rates of N fertilization; this understanding is important for mitigating the negative impact of global N enrichment on soil C cycling.

This study assessed the effects of rhizobium (Sinorhizobium meliloti CCNWSX0020) inoculation on the growth of alfalfa and soil microbial characteristics under Cu-stress. Further, we determined the regulatory mechanism of rhizobium inoculation to alleviate Cu-stress in alfalfa through plant-soil system. The results showed that rhizobium inoculation markedly alleviated Cu-induced growth inhibition in alfalfa by increasing the chlorophyll content, height, and biomass, in addition to nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Furthermore, rhizobium application alleviated Cu-induced phytotoxicity by increasing the antioxidant enzyme activities and soluble protein content in tissues, and inhibiting the lipid peroxidation levels (i.e., malondialdehyde content). In addition, rhizobium inoculation improved soil nutrient cycling, which increased soil enzyme activities (i.e., beta-glucosidase activity and alkaline phosphatase) and microbial biomass nitrogen. Both Pearson correlation coefficient analysis and partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) identified that the interactions between soil nutrient content, enzyme activity, microbial biomass, plant antioxidant enzymes, and oxidative damage could jointly regulate plant growth. This study provides comprehensive insights into the mechanism of action of the legume-rhizobium symbiotic system to mitigate Cu stress and provide an efficient strategy for phytoremediation of Cu-contaminated soils.

In this study, the effects of seed pre-soaking with MEL on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth and yield were investigated in a continuous two-year pot experiment and another year of field experimentation. Results showed that seed pre-soaking with different concentrations of MEL (10, 100 and 500 mu M) for 24 h increased grain yields per plant from 29% to 80% in pot experiment and increased grain yield per area from 4-19% in field experiment, compared with the controls. Further analysis showed that the beneficial effects of MEL on improving wheat grain yield can be ascribed to: (1) increased spike number by enhancing tiller number; (2) enhanced carbon assimilation capacity by maintaining large leaf area, high photosynthetic rate and delaying leaf senescence; (3) promoted growth in root system. The result of this study suggests that MEL could be considered as an effective plant growth regulator for improving grain production in winter wheat.

The present study examined root morphological and physiological responses of two graminoids (wheat and maize), and three legumes (soybean, white lupin and narrow-leafed lupin) to low P supply under two difference growth conditions. Two experiments using non-destructive root observation systems (Expt.1, semi-hydroponic system; Expt.2, rhizoboxes) were conducted under low P (Expt.1: 2 mu M; Expt.2: 9 mg kg(-1) soil) and optimal P (Expt.1: 200 mu M; Expt. 2: 60 mg kg(-1) soil). Plants were assessed 40 days after transplanting (Expt. 1) and 35 days after sowing (Expt. 2). Results showed that low P stress generally suppressed plant shoot and root growths of all crops and significantly increased root-shoot ratio in graminoid plants in both experiments. Root length vertical distribution in each 10 cm layer was relatively lower in low P than in optimal P treatments with the majority roots distributed in 10-40 cm layers in both experiments. Under low P, all plants accumulated significantly less P in plant tissues. Maize, soybean and white lupin plants had larger dry weights and P contents than wheat and narrow-leaf lupin under respective P treatment under both experiments except high P content in wheat cv Zhongyu 6 under optimal P in Expt. 2. Low P stress significantly increased plant P-use efficiency in both experiments with more profound increase in maize and white lupin in Expt. 1. Low P stress stimulated cluster roots formation in white lupin. Both lupin species had significantly higher rhizosheath acid phosphatase activity than other crops under low P supply. In conclusion, five crop species differed in their adaptive strategies to low P availability. Graminoid species had strong response by modifying their root morphology while legumes especially lupin species used the limited P more efficiently through enhancing rhizosheath acid phosphatase activity to cope with soil P deficit.

Semiconductivity Transition in Silicon Nanowires by Hole Transport Layer	NANO LETTERS												The surface of nanowires is a source of interest mainly for electrical prospects. Thus, different surface chemical treatments were carried out to develop recipes to control the surface effect. In this work, we succeed in shifting and tuning the semiconductivity of a Si nanowire-based device from n- to p-type. This was accomplished by generating a hole transport layer at the surface by using an electrochemical reaction-based nonequilibrium position to enhance the impact of the surface charge transfer. This was completed by applying different annealing pulses at low temperature (below 400 degrees C) to reserve the hydrogen bonds at the surface. After each annealing pulse, the surface was characterized by XPS, Kelvin probe measurements, and conductivity measured by FET based on a single Si NW. The mechanism and conclusion were supported experimentally and theoretically. To this end, this strategy has been demonstrated as an essential tool which could pave a new road for regulating semiconductivity and for other low-dimensional nanomaterials.

However, existing studies have not provided a comprehensive understanding of the effects of litter and root carbon inputs on the Q10 of soil respiration in different seasons. In this study, we used the trench method under in situ conditions to measure the total soil respiration (R-total), litter-removed soil respiration (Rno-litter), root-removed soil respiration (Rno-root), and the decomposition of soil organic matter (i.e., both litter and root removal; R-SOM) in different seasons of pioneer (Populus davidiana Dode) and climax (Quercus liaotungensis Mary) forests on the Loess Plateau, China. Soil temperature, soil moisture, litter biomass, fine root biomass, litter carbon, and root carbon were analyzed to obtain the drive mechanism of the Q(10) of soil respiration in the two forests. The results showed that the Q(10) of soil respiration exhibited seasonality, and the Q(10) of soil respiration was higher in summer. The litter enhanced the Q(10) of soil respiration considerably more than the root did. Soil temperature, soil moisture, fine root biomass, and litter carbon were the main factors used to predict the Q(10) of different soil respiration components. These findings indicated that factors affecting the Q(10) of soil respiration highly depended on soil temperature and soil moisture as well as related litter and root traits in the two forests, which can improve our understanding of soil carbon-climate feedback in global warming. The results of this study can provide reference for exploring soil respiration under temperate forest restoration.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Wu, Jianzhao/0000-0003-3124-1109; Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564													1674-6767	2194-7783				SEP	2022	14	9					1055	1068		10.1007/s40333-022-0102-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-022-0102-0													WOS:000855779100008

However, the function of lysine lactylation remains unexplored in wheat. In this study, we performed the first comparative proteomes and lysine lactylomes during seed germination of wheat. In total, 8000 proteins and 927 lactylated sites in 394 proteins were identified at 0 and 12 h after imbibition (HAI). Functional enrichment analysis showed that glycolysis- and TCA-cycle-related proteins were significantly enriched, and more differentially lactylated proteins were enriched in up-regulated lactylated proteins at 12 HAI vs. 0 HAI through the KEGG pathway and protein domain enrichment analysis compared to down-regulated lactylated proteins. Meanwhile, ten particularly preferred amino acids near lactylation sites were found in the embryos of germinated seeds: AA*KlaT, A***KlaD********A, KlaA**T****K, K******A*Kla, K*Kla********K, KlaA******A, Kla*A, KD****Kla, K********Kla and KlaG. These results supplied a comprehensive profile of lysine lactylation of wheat and indicated that protein lysine lactylation played important functions in several biological processes.																			1661-6596	1422-0067				NOV	2023	24	22							16195	10.3390/ijms242216195	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms242216195								38003390					WOS:001115251800001

Precisely predicting deep SOC at the regional scale is crucial for the accurate assessment of carbon sequestration potential in soils but has been challenging for a century. Herein, we developed a depth distribution function-based empirical approach to predict SOC in deep soils at the regional scale. We validated this approach with a dataset from four regions of the world and examined the application of this approach in China's Loess Plateau. We found that among the reported depth distribution functions describing vertical patterns of SOC, the negative exponential function performed best in fitting SOC along the soil profile in various regions. Moreover, the parameters (i.e., C-e and k) of the negative exponential function were linearly correlated to surface SOC (0-20 cm) and the changing rates of SOC within the topsoil (0-40 cm). Based on the above relationships, the empirical equations for predicting the negative exponential parameters are established. The validation results from site-specific and regional dataset showed that combining the negative exponential function and such empirical equations can precisely predict SOC concentration in soils down to 500 cm depth. Our study provides a simple, rapid and accurate method for predicting deep soil SOC at the regional scale, which could simplify the assessment of deep soil SOC in various regions.

To address this knowledge gap, the contents of fungal and bacterial necromass were estimated based on glucosamine and muramic acid contents in cropland (986 samples), grassland (278 samples), and forest (452 samples) soils. On an average, microbial necromass C contributed 51%, 47%, and 35% to the SOC in cropland, grassland, and forest soils, respectively, in the first 20 cm of topsoil. The contribution of microbial necromass to SOC increased with soil depth in grasslands (from 47% to 54%) and forests (from 34% to 44%), while it decreased in croplands (from 51% to 24%). The microbial necromass accumulation coefficient (the ratio between necromass and living microbial biomass C) was higher in soil from croplands (41) and grasslands (33) than in forest (20) soils. These results suggest that the turnover of living microbial biomass is faster in grassland and cropland soils than in forest soils, where the latter contains more partially decomposed plant residues. Fungal necromass C (65% of total necromass) had consistently higher contributions to SOC than bacterial necromass C (32-36%) in all soils due to i) a larger living fungal biomass than bacterial biomass, and ii) fungal cell com-pounds being decomposed slowly and, thus able to persist longer in soil. The ratio of fungal:bacterial necromass C increased from 2.4 to 2.9 in the order of croplands < grasslands < forests, because fungi are the principal decomposers of complex substrates dominant in grassland and, especially, in forest soils. The ratios of bacterial: microbial necromass and bacterial:fungal necromass in cropland soils are larger than those in grassland and forest soils. This result indicates that the relative contribution of fungal necromass to total microbial necromass is lowest in cropland among the three land uses. Moreover, fungal and bacterial necromass increased with the total living microbial C and N contents. Lower temperatures and soil pH (e.g., in temperate and boreal ecosystems) stimulate fungal and bacterial necromass accumulation. These findings highlight the fact that shifts in the bacterial:fungal necromass ratio and the microbial necromass contribution to SOC are ecosystem-specific and depend on climate. In conclusion, microbial necromass contributes to approximately half of the SOC in cropland and grassland soils, and only 35% in forest soils; whereas, two-thirds of microbial necromass are of fungal origin.

Materials and methods This study quantified metabolic limitation of microbes and their association with carbon use efficiency (CUE) via extracellular enzymatic stoichiometry and biogeochemical equilibrium models in field experiment employing five inorganic P gradients (0, 75, 150, 225, and 300 kg P ha(-1)) in farmland used to grow peas. Results and discussion Results showed P fertilization significantly increased soil Olsen-P and NO3--N contents, and enzyme activities (beta-1,4-glucosidase and beta-D-cellobiosidase) were significantly affected by P fertilization. It indicated that P fertilization significantly decreased microbial P limitation due to the increase of soil available P. Interestingly, P application also significantly decreased microbial nitrogen (N) limitation, a phenomenon primarily attributable to increasing NO3--N content via increasing biological N fixation within the pea field. Furthermore, P fertilization increased microbial CUE because the reduction in microbial N and P limitation leads to higher C allocation to microbial growth. Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) further revealed that the reduction of microbial metabolic limitation is conducive to soil C sequestration. Conclusions Our study revealed that P application in agroecosystem can alleviate not only microbial P limitation but also N limitation, which further reduces soil C loss via increasing microbial CUE. This study provides important insight into better understanding the mechanisms whereby fertilization mediates soil C cycling driven by microbial metabolism in agricultural ecosystems.

The present study was aimed at evaluating the suitability of wheat production shifting conventional flat planting (CFH) and supplemental irrigation (SIH) with water-saving cultivation stra-tegies [straw mulching (SML) and plastic film mulching (PFL) with 50% less N fertilizer] from economic, energy, and environmental perspectives on the Loess Plateau of China. Results showed that the PFL exhibited-18.5% and 12.7% higher grain yields, and 74.0% and 59.9% higher economic profit over the CFH and SML, while reduced grain yields by 9.6% retative to the SIH. Meanwhile, the economic profit and the ratio of income to cost remained consistent between the PFL and SIH. The PFL had the highest net energy out, energy use efficiency and energy productivity, but had the lowest specific energy. Compared with the SIH, the total environmental emissions final score increased by 36.6% under SML, while decreased by 24.8% under PFL. Overall, the strategy of plastic film mulching with 50% less N fertilizer has great potential to cater to the demands of wheat pro-duction with environmental sustainability on the Loess Plateau of China.																			0360-5442	1873-6785				DEC 15	2022	261		B						125330	10.1016/j.energy.2022.125330	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.125330		SEP 2022											WOS:000859020800008

However, the transformation of PAHs with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substitutional groups on clay minerals is not well understood currently. In this study, the degradation of anthracene (ANT) with different substituents (including-CH3,-CHO,-Br,-OMe, and-NO2) on Al(III)-montmorillonite (MMT) was investigated in the dark. The results showed that aromatic compounds were degraded with the rate constants (lobs) of 0.004-0.141 d-1. Moreover, ANT with electron-donating substituents (e.g.,-CH3,-OMe) had a higher transformation rate than that with electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g.,-Br,-NO2). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching experiments indicated that ROS played a significant role in the transformation of ANT and ANT derivatives. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the reactivity of single substituted PAHs was highly correlated with their ionization potential (IP), the energy of highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO), the energy of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO), and electronegativity (zeta), while independent of hardness (eta). This study provides novel insights into predicting the reactivity of PAHs derivatives, and lays a fundamental basis for better understanding the fate of substituted PAHs in soils.

In this study, soil fungal communities in topsoil (0-5 cm) and subsoil (5-10 cm) on simulated eroding slopes of three slope gradients, i.e., 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 20 degrees, and in the corresponding depositional zones were examined from 2015 to 2017 in the region of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The results showed that, compared with that in the 5 degrees reference slopes, soil fungal richness in the topsoil and subsoil of the 10 degrees and 20 degrees eroding slopes was 11.8-24.9% lower. However, the richness increased by 2.3-22.7% in the subsoil of the depositional zones, yet not in the topsoil. Soil fungal community compositions in both topsoil and subsoil differed between depositional zones and reference slopes but not between eroding slopes and reference slopes. The differentiation of fungal richness and community compositions between eroding slopes and depositional zones increased with slope gradients, regardless of the topsoil and the subsoil. Saprotrophic fungi levels were 22.5-48.0% lower and pathogenic fungi were 45.2-193.3% higher in the subsoil of the depositional zones with 10 degrees and 20 degrees slopes than in the subsoil of the 5 degrees reference slopes. Soil fungal network on the eroding slope was more complex than that in the depositional zone, suggesting more extensive interactions of fungal taxa and higher community stability potential on eroding slopes. The decreasing soil moisture, organic matter, and other properties on the eroding slopes, in contrast with these properties increasing in the depositional zones, were responsible for the variations in fungal richness and community composition. The divergent responses of soil fungal communities to soil erosion and deposition emphasized the complexity and variability of fungal communities during the soil erosion-deposition processes.

J	Mohiley, A; Tielbörger, K; Seifan, M; Gruntman, M				Mohiley, Anubhav; Tielborger, Katja; Seifan, Merav; Gruntman, Michal			The role of biotic interactions in determining metal hyperaccumulation in plants	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Heavy metal hyperaccumulation (MH) is a rare trait found in plant species that inhabit metal-contaminated soils. Two main hypotheses proposed to explain the selective advantage of MH are the elemental defence hypothesis and elemental allelopathy hypothesis. The elemental defence hypothesis suggests that MH functions as defence against herbivores while the elemental allelopathy hypothesis suggests that MH acts to inhibit the growth of neighbours. Nevertheless, these hypotheses are not likely to be mutually exclusive. Here, we present the first study to test both hypotheses simultaneously. We examined these hypotheses with the Cd hyperaccumulator, Arabidopsis halleri, which inhabits both metalliferous and non-metalliferous soils, thus providing an opportunity to test the hypotheses of both habitats. Arabidopsis halleri plants originating from several populations in both metalliferous and non-metalliferous soils were grown in a greenhouse in soils with or without cadmium (Cd). Their leaves were used in a feeding experiment with a specialist herbivore and in a set of leaf-leachate experiments that tested their effect on seed germination and seedling establishment of species co-occurring with A. halleri. Finally, a field survey in several A. halleri populations was conducted to compare herbivore load between A. halleri and neighbours from metalliferous versus non-metalliferous soils. Results of the feeding experiment and field survey suggest that Cd accumulation in A. halleri leaves could provide it with defence against herbivores. Results of the leaf-leachate experiments reveal that Cd accumulation has no effect on seed germination of neighbouring species but inhibits seedling establishment, particularly of plant species originating from non-metalliferous soils. Our results suggest that both herbivores and competing neighbours may jointly select for MH in plants. Moreover, MH could provide a selective advantage particularly in non-metalliferous soils, where neighbouring plants lack metal tolerance. These results highlight the importance of including different origins and populations of both the target species and its neighbouring plant species when studying the ecological role of MH.

EARTHS FUTURE												China has implemented the world's largest-ever vegetation restoration program in marginal mountainous areas to sustain life on land. However, land competition between the demand for grain and the need for green has threatened sustainable vegetation restoration. Here, focusing on China's marginal mountainous areas with the highest density of slope cropland, we explore the optimal solution in the trade-offs between green and grain. We find that current vegetation restoration strategies are not sufficiently optimized, which may threaten the survival and development of local farmers and in turn destroy existing vegetation restoration achievements. Through adjusting vegetation restoration objectives carefully tailored to local conditions, the population experiencing grain shortages can be greatly reduced by 51-66% (from 18.26 million to 6.29-8.90 million) compared with the current scheme. The optimal design will alleviate the conflict between grain and green, thereby promoting sustainable ecological restoration in China. Our research provides an important reference for the world's mountainous areas to achieve a win-win situation between green and grain.

However, it is not clear which combination ratio of regular and controlled-release urea will increase the soil microbial community complexity and improve maize yield in the North China Plain. To address this knowledge gap, a 2-year field experiment was conducted to explore the effects of the combination of regular (U) and controlled release (S) urea ratios [no fertilizer control (CT), regular urea alone (U), controlled-release urea alone (S), controlled-release urea mixed with regular urea 3:7 (SU3), controlled-release urea mixed with regular urea 5:5 (SU5), and controlled-release urea mixed with regular urea 7:3 (SU7)] on XianYu 688 yield and its rhizosphere and bulk soil microbial community composition and network complexity at different fertility stages. The combination of controlled-release and regular urea increased the N agronomic efficiency, N partial factors productivity, maize yield, and grain number per spike, with the maximum maize yield (9,186 kg ha(-1)) being achieved when the ratio of controlled-release urea to regular urea was 3:7 (SU3, p < 0.05). Maize yield increased by 13% in the SU3 treatment compared to the CT treatment. Rhizosphere soil microbial diversity remained stable at the silking stage of maize while increased at the physiological maturity stage of maize, with the increasing controlled-release to regular N fertilizer ratios (from 3:7 to 7:3, p < 0.05). This result suggests that a combination of regular and controlled-release N fertilizer can still substantially increase soil microbial diversity in the later stages of maize growth. The combination of controlled-release and regular urea is more effective in improving microbial network total links and average degree, and N agronomic efficiency (R-2 = 0.79, p < 0.01), N partial factor productivity (R-2 = 0.79, p < 0.01), spikes per unit area (R-2 = 0.54, p < 0.05), and maize yield (R-2 = 0.42, p < 0.05) increased with the microbial network complexity. This result indicates that the higher microbial network complexity is strongly associated with the higher N agronomic efficiency and N partial factors productivity and maize yield. In conclusion, the ratio of controlled-release to regular urea at SU3 not only increases the yield of maize and N agronomic efficiency but also enhances microbial diversity and network complexity in the North China Plain.					li, xiang/GWM-6319-2022															1664-302X				JUN 21	2022	13								825787	10.3389/fmicb.2022.825787	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.825787								35801114					WOS:000820857700001

However, the degradation rate of biodegradable plastic film over the entire crop growth period is still unclear, as well as its impact on crop growth and product quality. Here, several properties of two kinds of composite biodegradable mulch films, PBAT/PLA-[S1] and PBAT/lignin-[S2], are studied with polyethylene-[PE] and uncovered substrate (CK) as controls. We tested the differences in morphological characterization, physical properties, and weight loss rate of the plastic films, as well as the effects of the different plastic films on melon yield and quality, substrate temper-ature and humidity, physical and chemical properties of the substrate, and substrate fungal species composition. Com-pared to PE, biodegradable plastic films S1 and S2 increased substrate temperature and the net photosynthetic rate of leaves. The results of substrate 18 s rDNA assay of CK, PE, S1, and S2 after 80 days of treatment and pre-treatment showed that a total of 12 fungal phylum, with 317 fungal genera were found, in which Ascomycota as the main phyla and Penicillium as the main genera. Compared with PE, the S2 treatment significantly increased the single fruit weight, central sugar content and soluble sugar of melon by 225.35 g, 1.26%, and 0.68%, respectively (p < 0.05). When buried for 240 d, the weight loss rate of S2 was significantly increased by 86.08% compared with PE (p < 0.05). From these results, we extrapolated that covering the substrate with the most biodegradable film, PBAT/ lignin composite (10 mu m), improved the yield and fruit quality of the melon in winter greenhouse production.

However, changes in the soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus storages and stoichiometry after mixed afforestation with the N-fixing tree species under the "Grain for Green Project" in the Loess Plateau of China are not well understood. Typical restoration types, including the mixed plantations of Pinus tabuliformis with Hippophae rhamnoides (HrPt) and Robinia pseudoacacia with H. rhamnoides (HrRp), as well as the pure forests of P. tabuliformis (P-t) and R. pseudoacacia (R-p), were chosen to examine changes in the storages and stoichiometry of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in 0-100 cm soil layers. The results showed that compared with the corresponding pure forest, HrRp significantly increased the SOC content in the 0-20 cm soil layer and the SOC storage in the 0-100 cm layer, while HrPt significantly increased the SOC content in the 0-10 cm layer, but there was no significant difference for SOC storage in the 0-100 cm layer between P-t and HrPt. Similarly, HrRp significantly increased the TN content in the 0-10 cm layer and the TN storage in the 0-100 cm layer, but there was no significant difference in TN storage between P-t and HrPt. Furthermore, HrRp significantly increased the TP content in the 0-100 cm layer and TP storage was higher than that of R-p, while there were no significant differences in TP content and storage between P-t and HrPt. In the 0-10 cm soil layer, HrRp significantly reduced C:N and increased N:P, but HrPt significantly increased C:P. In addition, compared with the pure forest, the soil physical and chemical properties had a stronger control effect on the soil storages and stoichiometric ratios in the mixed forests. In summary, compared with P. tabuliformis, the introduction of N-fixing tree species into the R. pseudoacacia forest was more conducive to the accumulation of SOC, TN, and TP reserves and the improvement of the N and P utilization efficiency. These results have important implications for the restoration of degraded vegetation and scientific management of mixed plantations on the Loess Plateau and can provide basic data for the assessment of soil quality at the regional scale.																				1999-4907				DEC	2021	12	12							1718	10.3390/f12121718	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f12121718													WOS:000742442400001

However, few studies have investigated the potential effects of different degradation levels and restoration ages on soil erodibility on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau where many alpine grasslands suffering from severe degradation have been restored for different years.Materials and methodsIn order to quantify the impact of alpine grassland degradation and restoration on soil erodibility, we selected different degradation levels (non-degraded, lightly degraded, moderately degraded, and heavily degraded) and restored ages (3, 8, 13, and 19 years) on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Soil sampling was carried out at different depths, and the microaggregate fractal dimension (D-v), multifractal theory (D-m) and erodibility factor (K) were measured and calculated to quantify the soil changes in erodibility.Results and discussionWith the degree of degradation increased, the K value in the surface soil changed little, but the D-v value increased significantly. On the grassland recovery sequence, the K value showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing, and the K factor and D-m of 19-y restored grasslands was reverted to the same level as that of the non-degraded site. Furthermore, the K value and D-v value increased with the increase in soil depth. Our result also shows that root biomass, microorganisms, and soil physicochemical properties including SOC, TN, TP, PSD, and MSD were all significantly correlated with K value.ConclusionsOur research proves that restoration of alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau helps reduce soil erodibility, and reveals that plant roots, soil physical and chemical properties, and microorganisms play an important role in reducing soil erodibility, further deepening the influence on soil erodibility. This understanding can provide a certain theoretical basis for the sustainable development of grassland ecosystems.

M.			Quantitative partitioning of temporal origin of transpiration into pre- and post-plantation under deep-rooted vegetation on the Loess Plateau of China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Deep-rooted vegetation transpires a considerable amount of deep soil water with different ages in the unsaturated zone. However, the tradeoffs between new water of transpiration (temporally originating from post-planting precipitation) and old water of transpiration (temporally originating from pre-planting precipitation) across the vegetation lifespan are poorly understood. In this study, we collected soil samples from beyond 28 m soil depth on the Loess Plateau of China to investigate the influence of deep-rooted vegetation on the age of soil water and analyze the proportion of new and old water of transpiration in the unsaturated zone under grassland, 22-year-old apple orchard, and 17-year-old peach orchard. Water isotopes (H-2, O-18, and H-3), solutes (chloride, nitrate, sulfate), and soil water content were used to identify the critical water ages in the unsaturated zone (one-year water age, water age corresponding to stand age, and the maximum water age of transpiration), and to determine soil water deficit, soil evaporation loss fraction, and potential groundwater recharge. The results showed that soil water mainly moved as piston flow in these soil profiles, and deep soil water largely came from heavy precipitation. Deep-rooted vegetation restrained new pore water velocity and potential groundwater recharge. New pore water velocity declined from 0.40 m yr(-1) to 0.14 m yr(-1) and 0.34 m yr(-1) for apple and peach, respectively. Deep-rooted vegetation decreased groundwater recharge by 9.46 % for apple and 7.04 % for peach, compared to grassland. Over the vegetation lifespan, annual average transpiration was 500.56 mm yr(-1) and 468.89 mm yr(-1) with maximum water age of 63 years and 45 years for apple and peach, respectively. The transpiration of deep-rooted vegetation mainly used new water-94.97 % for apple and 97.47 % for peach. The total old water of transpiration was 553 mm for apple and 209 mm for peach. Our results identify the temporal sources of vegetation water use, offering new insights into the transpiration process of deep-rooted vegetation.					wu, wenjie/IUN-9258-2023; Siddique, Kadambot H.M./B-3462-2011; Si, Bing Cheng/H-8745-2012	Siddique, Kadambot H.M./0000-0001-6097-4235; Si, Bing Cheng/0000-0002-7497-5033; Chen, Guangjie/0000-0002-4518-7038													0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2023	617		A						128964	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128964		DEC 2022											WOS:000921133400001
J	Zhang, H; Wang, B; Liu, DL; Zhang, MX; Leslie, LM; Yu, Q				Zhang, Hong; Wang, Bin; Liu, De Li; Zhang, Mingxi; Leslie, Lance M.; Yu, Qiang			Using an improved SWAT model to simulate hydrological responses to land use change: A case study of a catchment in tropical Australia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Land use change is one of the dominant driving factors of watershed hydrological change. Thus, hydrological responses to land use changes require detailed assessments to ensure sustainable management of both water resources and natural ecosystems. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model has been widely used to simulate the impacts of land use change on water balance. However, the original SWAT model has poor performance in estimating the leaf area index (LAI) of different vegetation types for tropical areas. The objective of this study was to simulate the impact of different land use change scenarios (deforestation, afforestation and urbanization) on the water balance, using an improved SWAT model with vegetation growth calibrated from MODIS LAI data. The North Johnstone River catchment in wet tropical eastern Australia was selected as the case study area. Results showed that the modified SWAT model was able to reproduce smoothed MODIS LAI with NSE >= 0.59 (NSE < 0 for default SWAT), R-2 >= 0.70 (R-2 <= 0.66 for default SWAT), and vertical bar PBIAS vertical bar <= 2.5% (vertical bar PBIAS vertical bar >= 42% for default SWAT), and to predict monthly streamflow well with NSE >= 0.92 (NSE >= 0.90 for default SWAT), R-2 >= 0.94 (R-2 >= 0.90 for default SWAT). It is noted that SWAT-T had vertical bar PBIAS vertical bar <= 10% while vertical bar PBIAS vertical bar <= 5% for default SWAT. Land use change impacted all hydrological variables, with the impact on surface runoff being the most notable at yearly scale (8.9%, 5.7%, - 9.5% and 15.9% for scenario 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Absolute changes of surface runoff under land use change scenarios differed across months, with the most notable absolute change occurring during the wet season (December to May) (1.2 similar to 6.6 mm, 1.0 similar to 3.5 mm, - 7.3 similar to -1.1 mm and 3.0 similar to 9.0 mm for scenario 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Urbanization increased surface runoff (5.7% and 15.9% for scenario 2 and 4, respectively) and decreased lateral runoff (- 0.7% and - 1.3%) and groundwater (-0.9% and - 3.5%), but produced no clear change in total runoff (0.2% and 0.2%), actual evapotranspiration (- 0.3% and - 0.3%), and soil water (0.5% and 0.7%) at the annual time scale. Furthermore, afforestation could decrease surface runoff (- 9.5% for scenario 3) and soil water (- 2.0%), increase evapotranspiration (1.7%), and lead to slight changes (absolute values <= 0.8%) in other hydrological variables at the annual time scale. A strong positive correlation (r >= 0.94) was observed between annual rainfall and total runoff for forest-evergreen, range-grasses, and urban land use. Forest-evergreen generally produced less total runoff than range-grasses and urban land use under conditions of the same rainfall, terrain slope, and soil texture. In addition, urban land use generally produced more surface runoff and less lateral runoff and groundwater than forest-evergreen and range-grasses under the same conditions. These results contribute important information for development of effective adaptation strategies and future policy plans for sustainable water management in tropical eastern Australia.					zhang, mingxi/GYI-9562-2022; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009; Wang, Bin/AFI-6568-2022	Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Wang, Bin/0000-0002-6422-5802; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908; zhang, Hong/0000-0001-9369-7481													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUN	2020	585								124822	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124822	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124822													WOS:000544230000074

To find stability patterns, this study evaluated the soil hydro-thermic response in a rainfed organic vineyard with humid climate, a permanent grass cover and under no-tillage and homogeneous soil and topographic conditions. The differences between the rows (R) and inter-row areas (IR) and two cultivars (Agudelo -Ag- and Blanco Legitimo -BL-) were assessed. SWC and ST were measured with 12 probes every 15 min at 5, 15 and 25 cm depth over the crop cycle (242 days). On average, wetter (+2.2%) and cooler (-1.4%) values appeared in Ag than in BL that may be associated with differences in vine water demand. IR had wetter (+5.9%) and cooler (-0.7%) conditions than R due to higher water consumption by vines. Sig-nificant differences appeared when time-series analysis was split into three periods: drying and warming (spring), dry and warm (summer), and wetting and cooling (autumn). SWC and ST correlated well in R, but moderate correlations appeared in IR, showing a more complex pattern in this zone. In general, the most stable conditions appeared at 15 cm depth, with drier and warmer conditions in the deepest layer in spring and autumn. This vertical pattern did not vary over time for ST, but IR had the most stable and moistest conditions in summer at 25 cm. The relative differences among zones and cultivars revealed that Ag had moister, but less represen-tative, conditions than BL at the three soil layers in spring, and this pattern kept in summer at 15 and 25 cm, but only in autumn at 15 cm. Regarding ST, the pattern was very stable, and cooler and representative conditions prevailed in Ag. BL has been rarely cited in the literature, and these results contributed with new insights about the SWC and ST dynamic on this cultivar. Cooler conditions always appeared in IR, compared with R; and R always had more representative values of SWC than IR. The pattern of ST was more variable and R only had more representative values than IR at 15 cm in summer and at 25 cm in spring and summer. This article represents the first study that calculated the index of temporal stability (ITS) for SWC and ST in any type of woody crop. Our findings allowed to identify the most representative areas of the hydro-thermic response of the soil in the vineyard, which is of interest to save time and resources during long-term monitoring tasks in commercial vineyards.

Existing information on the spatial variation of black soil thickness is inadequate. In this paper, we propose a model framework for spatial estimation of the black soil thickness at the watershed scale by integrating field observations, unmanned aerial vehicle variations of topography, and satellite variations of vegetation with the aid of random forest. We sampled 141 sample profiles over a watershed and identified the black soil thickness based on indices of the mollic epipedon. Topographic variables were derived from a digital elevation model and vegetation variables were derived from Landsat 8 imagery. Random forest was used to determine the relationship between black soil thickness and environmental variables. The resulting model explained 61% of the black soil thickness spatial variation, which was more than twice that of traditional interpolation methods (ordinary kriging, universal kriging and inverse distance weighting). Topographic variables contributed the most toward explaining the thickness, followed by vegetation indices. The black soil thickness over the watershed had a clear catenary soil pattern, with thickest black soil in the low depositional areas and thinnest at the higher elevations that drain into the low areas. The proposed model framework will improve estimates of soil thickness in the region of our study.

J	Zhang, DJ; Ge, WY; Zhang, Y				Zhang, Daojun; Ge, Wenyan; Zhang, Yu			Evaluating the vegetation restoration sustainability of ecological projects: A case study of Wuqi County in China	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Grain for Green project has achieved substantial results in ecological reconstruction and social benefits in China. Meantime, some doubts also exist, and one of the most concerned themes is its sustainability. Although some studies address this topic, there are deficiencies in the research scale and depth. In this work, except for traditional growth trend analysis of vegetation restoration by using vegetation index from 2000 to 2016 in Wuqi County of China, Moran's I was used to analyze the competition for water and nutrients among the vegetation due to restricted space, and the Hurst exponent was used to analyze the future development trends of the vegetation cover. The results show that although the vegetation coverage rate of the study area has improved steadily since the implementation of the ecological policy, limited further improvement in the study area is possible in the future; and vegetation restoration is generally sustainable in the southeastern part of the study area but not in the northwestern part of the study area from a spatial perspective. In terms of driving factors, natural factors are the decisive factors affecting the sustainability of vegetation restoration; ecological projects and maintenance measures may promote vegetation restoration generally but they should be controlled at a certain level, otherwise, the counterproductive result would be obtained. Therefore, vegetation restoration should be adapted to local conditions rather than uniform standards being adopted for the entire region, and this conclusion should apply equally to ecological restoration efforts in other regions of the world. Also, from a methodological point of view, this study proposes to analyze the sustainability of vegetation restoration based on the spatial and temporal perspectives by using the spatial autocorrelation and Hurst exponent methods, which is a development and supplement to previous studies and has a certain advantage for evaluating the vegetation restoration status.

Under PEG-6000 Induced Drought Stress	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, MT) can mitigate abotic stress, including drought stress on a number of crops. However, it is unclear whether and how seed priming with melatonin alleviates the effects of drought stress on seed germination and seedling growth of triticale (Triticale hexaploide L.). In this study, we investigated the effects of seed priming with MT on seed germination, protective enzyme activity, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide in triticale under PEG-6000 induced drought stress. Seed priming with 20 mu M MT alleviated the adverse effects of PEG-6000 induced drought stress on seed germination and seedling growth. Triticale seeds primed with 20 mu M MT exhibited improved germination potential, germination rate, germ and radicle length. Specifically, MT priming increased the germination rate by 57.67% compared with unprimed seeds. Seed priming with melatonin also alleviated the adverse effects of PEG-6000 induced drought stress on triticale seedlings. MT pretreatment with 20 mu M significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, plant height, leaf area, and relative chlorophyll concentration, enhanced the activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase, and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malonaldehyde content in the seeds (germ and radicle) and seedlings (leaf and root). Collectively, these results suggest that seed priming with melatonin promotes ROS scavenging capacity and enhances energy supply and antioxidant enzyme activities to alleviate the adverse effects of drought stress in triticale.

The vast functional gene repertoire of soil microbial communities is composed of both core and accessory genes, which may be governed by distinct drivers. This intuitive hypothesis, however, remains largely unexplored. We conducted a 5-year nitrogen and water addition experiment in the Eurasian steppe and quantified microbial gene diversity via shotgun metagenomics. Nitrogen addition led to an 11-fold increase in the abundance (based on quantitative PCR [qPCR]) of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, which have mainly core community genes and few accessory community genes. Thus, nitrogen addition substantially increased the relative abundance of many core genes at the whole-community level. Water addition stimulated both plant diversity and microbial respiration; however, increased carbon/energy resources from plants did not counteract increased respiration, so soil carbon/energy resources became more limited. Thus, water addition selected for microorganisms with genes responsible for degrading recalcitrant soil organic matter. Accordingly, many other microorganisms without these genes (but likely with other accessory community genes due to relatively stable average microbial genome size) were selected against, leading to the decrease in the diversity of accessory community genes. In summary, nitrogen addition primarily affected core community genes through nitrogen-cycling processes, and water addition primarily regulated accessory community genes through carbon-cycling processes. Although both gene components may significantly respond as the intensity of nitrogen/water addition increases, our results demonstrated how these common global change factors distinctly impact each component. IMPORTANCE Our results demonstrated increased ecosystem nitrogen and water content as the primary drivers of the core and accessory components of soil microbial community functional diversity, respectively. Our findings suggested that more attention should be paid to certain components of community functional diversity under specific global change conditions. Our findings also indicated that microbial communities have adapted to nitrogen addition by strengthening the function of ammonia oxidization to deplete the excess nitrogen, thus maintaining ecosystem homeostasis. Because community gene richness is primarily determined by the presence/absence of accessory community genes, our findings further implied that strategies such as maintaining the amount of soil organic matter could be adopted to effectively improve the functional gene diversity of soil microbial communities subject to global change factors.

To explore the effect of late shoot pruning on grape berry and wine metabolite composition, field trials were carried out on Vitis vinifera cv. Malbec and cv. Syrah grafted on 110 Richter rootstock. Fifty-one metabolites were detected and unequivocally annotated employing UPLC-MS based metabolite profiling. Integrating the data using hierarchical clustering showed a significant effect of late pruning treatments on must and wine metabolites. Syrah metabolite profiles were characterized by a general trend of higher metabolite content in the late shoot pruning treatments, while Malbec profiles did not show a consistent trend. In summary, late shoot pruning exerts a significant effect, though varietal specific, on must and wine quality-related metabolites, possibly related to enhanced photosynthetic efficiency, which should be taken into consideration when planning mitigating strategies in warm climates.

However, after revegetation, spoil heaps can be transformed into available land resources such as cultivated land and forest land. Previous studies have reported the runoff and sediment reduction benefits of different vegetation measures on spoil heaps, while little information has been documented about what differences in the taproot and fibrous root grasses were transferred into the differences in hydrological and erosion processes. This study compared the effects of taproot (Artemisia gmelinii (A. gmelinii)) and fibrous root (Cynodon dactylon (C. dactylon)) grasses on soil erosion and runoff production processes and the reduction benefits of spoil heaps with silt loam soil. A series of rainfall events at three intensities (0.8, 1.2, and 1.8 mm min-1) were simulated on runoff plots (length of 3.0 m and width of 1.0 m) under treatments of A. gmelinii, C. dactylon, and bare soil (BS, as control) (each treatment was replicated), and the initial runoff time (IRT), saturated hydraulic conductivity, runoff rate (RR), flow velocity, and soil loss rate (SLR) were measured. The results showed that grasses delayed the IRTs on spoil heaps by 0.69-12.96 min compared BS, and the delay effects were more significant for fibrous root grass than for taproot grass. The soil loss reduction benefits (91.1 %) of the two kinds of grass were approximately 2.2 times greater than those of runoff volume reduction (42.1 %), and shear stress could be used to predict the soil loss rate following power functions (R2 = 0.72-0.85) for the grass-covered plots. The taproot grass exhibited a higher erosion reduction than fibrous root grass and is thus preferred to control the soil erosion of spoil heaps. Taproot grass has a greater stem diameter and can insert deeper into spoil heaps to consolidate the soil particles, which can improve roughness and hydraulic resistance, thereby producing a lower effective hydraulic shear stress that is directly exerted on soil particles. This study enhances the understanding of different grasses on the water erosion process and mechanism of spoil heaps and provides scientific guidance for selecting erosion control practices.					wang, yi/HOF-6668-2023; li, wl/JJC-0768-2023; chen, si/JPK-4258-2023; Wang, Yahui/JCO-6233-2023; feng, chen/JLM-8296-2023	Guo, Mingming/0000-0002-4887-5688; Li, Jianming/0000-0001-5888-7351													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR	2023	618								129169	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129169	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129169		JAN 2023											WOS:000967463000001

The objective of the study was to determine the photosynthetic and yield responses of maize and peanut under six treatments: sole maize, sole peanut, maize-peanut intercropping, maize-peanut rotation-intercropping, 20% and 40% N reductions for maize in the maize-peanut rotation-intercropping. Maize-peanut intercropping had no land-use advantage. Intercropped peanut is limited in carboxylation rates and electron transport rate (ETR), leading to a decrease in hundred-grain weight (HGW) and an increase in blighted pods number per plant (N-BP). Intercropped peanut adapts to light stress by decreasing light saturation point (I-sat) and light compensation point (I-comp) and increasing the electron transport efficiency. Intercropped maize showed an increase in maximum photosynthetic rate (Pn(max)) and I-comp due to a combination of improved intercellular CO2 concentration, carboxylation rates, PSII photochemical quantum efficiency, and ETR. Compare to maize-peanut intercropping, maize-peanut rotation-intercropping alleviated the continuous crop barriers of intercropped border row peanut by improving carboxylation rates, electron transport efficiency and decreasing I-sat, thereby increasing its HGW and N-BP. More importantly, the land equivalent ratio of maize-peanut rotation-intercropping in the second and third planting years were 1.05 and 1.07, respectively, showing obvious land use advantages. A 20% N reduction for maize in maize-peanut rotation-intercropping does not affect photosynthetic character and yield for intercropped crops. However, a 40% N reduction decreased significantly the carboxylation rates, ETR, I-comp and Pn(max) of intercropped maize, thereby reducing in a 14.83% HGW and 5.75% lower grain number per spike, and making land-use efficiency negative.

However, uncertainty in runoff projection due to different ETp inputs has not been fully assessed. This study firstly adopted the physically-based Penman model, temperature-based Hargreaves model, and radiation-based Abtew, Jensen-Haise, and modified Makkink models to drive Xinanjiang (XAJ) model, thus investigating the influence of different potential evapotranspiration (ETp) inputs on runoff simulation. Then, we used the validated XAJ model to project runoff in North Johnstone catchment, northeast Australia. Lastly, we quantified the uncertainty caused by 34 global climate models (GCMs), different representative concentrative pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 & RCP8.5), and different ETp models with the technique of three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). We found that XAJ model performed well (R-2 >= 0.88, NSE >= 0.86) and showed low sensitivity to different ETp inputs in runoff simulation and projection. Under future climate scenarios, spring and winter runoff had a large decrease, which was mainly caused by the decrease in rainfall. The mean decreases in spring and winter runoff were 14.6% - 20.1% and 10.3% - 15.2% respectively by 2090s under RCP8.5. GCMs (50.9% - 67.4%) and their interaction with RCPs (35.4% - 46.6%) were the dominant factors resulting in uncertainty in runoff projection. Our study not only advanced the understanding of the impacts of different ETp inputs on runoff projection but also offered insights on the understanding of the roles different factors played in the uncertainty in runoff projection. We expect such knowledge can provide a way forward to narrow down the uncertainty in runoff projection, thus providing more robust information for policy makers in water management.

J	Wu, GL; Zhao, JX				Wu, Gao-Lin; Zhao, Jingxue			Warming positively promoted community appearance restoration of the degraded alpine meadow although accompanied by topsoil drying	OECOLOGIA												On-going climate warming is threatening the ecological function of grassland ecosystems. However, whether warming has positive effects on community microhabitats and appearance, especially in degraded grasslands, remains elusive. To address this issue, we conducted a 2-year field experiment on the severely degraded alpine meadow and undegraded alpine meadow with no warming and warming treatments. Community coverage and height in degraded meadow significantly increased under warming, while these changes were not significant in undegraded meadow. Two-year warming increased the community height of degraded meadow and undegraded meadow by 56.55% and 10.99%, respectively. Warming also increased community coverage by 41.88% in degraded meadow and decreased community coverage by 3.01% in undegraded meadow. Moreover, the response of topsoil temperature to warming was stronger in degraded meadow (6.89%) than in undegraded meadow (- 0.26%), while the negative response of topsoil moisture to warming was weaker in degraded meadow (- 13.95%) than in undegraded meadow (- 20.00%). The SEMs further demonstrated that warming had positive effects on topsoil temperature and community height, while had negative effects on topsoil moisture both in degraded and undegraded meadows. Our results confirm that warming-induced soil drying is an important pathway affecting the community appearance in alpine meadows. These findings highlight that warming has positive effects on community height and coverage and is particularly effective in improving community coverage appearance in severely degraded alpine meadow with topsoil drying.

However, existing methods of sediment volume estimation often require detailed field measurements and historical topographic data, limiting the broader application of these methods. In this paper, focusing on the region that suffers the world's most severe soil erosion, we combine unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry and simulate submerging analysis to propose a novel method for estimating sediment silted by check dams under complex topography. We obtained 1339 groups of topographic factors and ascertained the corresponding volumes of sediment deposited behind check dams in the loess hilly region of China (LHRC), and established five different models combined with regression analysis. Two different sets of data were used for method validation and optimal model determination. The results showed that the error of the optimal model in the volume estimation of single check dam and regional check dams is 12-13% and 2-3%, respectively. Additionally, the area-volume model has the potential to evaluate the sediment retention capacity of check dams (in the order of billions of cubic meters) in the whole LHRC, because the variables are easy to obtain and the model accuracy is relatively high. The further application of this method will help to evaluate the watershed sediment yield and regional soil and water conservation benefits, and is of great significance for explaining the future changes in water and sediment in the Yellow River basin.

However, the spatial variation in soil quality and plant diversity following vegetation restoration remains unclear. This study was designed to explore soil nutrient dynamics and how soil nutrients affect plant diversity and spatial heterogeneity after shrub restoration. We assessed the effect ofHaloxylon ammodendron(C.A.Mey.) Bunge (which has been planted over 30 years) on the soil nutrients and plant diversity in a desert-oasis ecotone in Minqin County, Gansu, China, using geostatistics, beta diversity and rarefaction analyses, and Hill number extrapolation. Soil nutrients, including soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and alkali nitrogen, increased significantly afterH. ammodendronplanting. Species richness gradually increased from 1-5 years to 10-20 years afterH. ammodendronwas planted but then decreased at 20-30 years. The largest differences in plant composition were observed at 15 and 20 years. Plant diversity increased in the whole 30 years after shrub planting, increasing in the first 25 years and then decreasing at 26-30 year stage. The maximum coefficient of determination for the spatial heterogeneity model fit was 0.84 (25 years). The spatial heterogeneity in vegetation decreased with increasing soil available K content at 1-10 years. Our results suggest that planting shrubs can improve soil conditions and plant species diversity in desert-oasis ecotones and soil nutrients have a strong influence on plant diversity patterns and spatial heterogeneity following vegetation restoration.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014														1085-3278	1099-145X				JAN 30	2021	32	2					670	683		10.1002/ldr.3690	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3690		SEP 2020											WOS:000573411800001

During 2012-2014, we performed a field evaluation of the influence of RFRHP with supplementary irrigation (RI) on the water irrigation use and water use efficiency by maize in a semiarid climate using the following treatments: (1) no supplementary irrigation (RN); (2) irrigation during the trumpeting stage (RB); (3) irrigation during the blooming stage (RF); (4) irrigation during the trumpeting and blooming stages (RBF); and (4) traditional flat planting with border irrigation (CK). We found that although the irrigation volume was double under CK, the soil water content in the 0-120 cm soil layer did not differ significantly between the RFRHP with supplementary irrigation treatments and CK. The RFRHP with supplementary irrigation treatments reduced the irrigation water volume required (750-1125 m(3) hm(-2)) and alleviated drought stress during key maize growth periods. The biomass, grain yield, and water use efficiency were significantly higher under RFRHP with supplementary irrigation, i.e., 6.0-8.7%, 15.4-25.8%, and 34.9-39.2% higher compared with CK, respectively, and 3.8-6.4%, 4.8-14.2%, and 9.2-12.7% higher compared with RFRHP with no supplementary irrigation. Under RFRHP with supplementary irrigation treatments, the irrigation water use efficiency was 1.5-3.9 times higher than that under CK. The irrigation water productivity levels under the RFRHP with supplementary irrigation treatments were ranked as follows: trumpeting stage > trumpeting and blooming stages > blooming stage. Compared with CK, RFRHP with supplementary irrigation significantly increased the out/input ratio and net income by 13.1-26.9% and 2600-3762 Chinese Yuan hm(-2), respectively.

The task is more daunting in the semi-arid region of the globe. In addition to the primary nutrient deficiency over the mining of secondary nutrients, especially sulfur is an emerging challenge in contemporary crop production systems. Hence, there is a dire need to devise an appropriate sulfur management protocol by searching for efficient and sustainable sulfur sources. Therefore, the efficacy of new sulfur molecules was evaluated on the performance and nutrient acquisition potential of the pearl millet-mustard system at the research farm of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi, India, for two years. The flexibility of urea-ES technology allows customized sulfur-enhanced urea formulations that suit unique crop needs, offering an all-in-one nitrogen and sulfur fertilizer solution. Hence, the study hypothesized that new sulfur molecules like sulfonated urea (SEU) will have a positive impact on crop growth, yield, and nutrient acquisition in the pearl millet-mustard system. The results revealed that the application of 50% sulfur (S) (15 kg/ha) as a base and 50% (15 kg/ha) as a topdressing (SEU 10-0-0-75) produced better growth, yield-contributing parameters, and economic productivity of the pearl millet-mustard system. However, both compositions of SEU (40-0-0-13 and 10-0-0-75) were significantly better than the recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) and the RDF along with other S sources like single super phosphate and bentonite in enhancing crop growth and productivity. The agronomic efficiency of nitrogen (AEn) and S (Aes) of SEU (40-0-0-13 and 10-0-0-75) were 9.1 and 10.3 kg seed yield/kg N and 51.2 and 28.9 kg seed/kg, respectively. The agronomic nitrogen use efficiency of SEU (40-0-0-13) and SEU (10-0-0-75) is significantly higher than those of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) alone. Thus, the findings inferred that splitting S (50% as a base and 50% as topdressing) through SEU is a practically feasible and economically robust S option for profitable and sustainable production of the pearl millet-mustard production model in the semi-arid region.

However, the influence of SOC from different fall/winter cover crop roots (annual and perennial crops) on aggregate stability through soil internal forces (SIFs) (electrostatic repulsive force (P-erf), van der Waals attractive force (P-vdw), and surface hydration repulsive force (P-h)) remains unclear. The objectives of this study were compare three fall/winter cover crops (lucerne, rapeseed, six-year-vetiver (Vet_6Y)) and two control (fallow and fallow with SOC removal (fallow-SOC-R)) to determine SOC effects red soil aggregation through SIFs. Plant root morphological and chemical traits, SOC properties, soil surface charge properties, soil internal forces and aggregate breakdown were all determined. The perennial crop (Vet_6Y) showed the highest root number density (0.21 counts cm(-2)), second highest root mass density (1.80 mg cm(-3)), and the lowest root lignin/cellulose ratio (0.69), and thus contributed to higher SOC content and SOC functional groups (mainly polysaccharide-C) than annual crops (rapeseed and lucerne). Such SOC traits in perennial vetiver resulted in a higher specific surface area (SSA), lower surface charge density and surface charge number (Q(s)) compared to annual crops (rapeseed and lucerne) and controls, and the relationship between the root, SOC and soil surface properties (i.e., SSA) was further confirmed by significant correlation (r ranging from 0.76 to 0.97). Ultimately, these soil surface charge properties after cover crops increased P-vdw, decreased P-erf, and thus decreased repulsive net force (P-net) (the sum of P-vdw, P-erf, and P-h) and the average repulsive net force displayed in order of fallow-SOC-R (2.77 MPa) > fallow (2.11 MPa) > lucerne (2.02 MPa) > rapeseed (1.78 MPa) > Vet_6Y (1.45 MPa) at a distance of 1 nm. This resulted in the mass percentage of released small particles (<20, <10, and <2 mu m) w (<d) % from aggregate being reduced after cover crops compared to controls. Generally, clayey red soil aggregate stability can be improved by decreasing the repulsive soil P-net through cover crop root contribution to SOC and SOC-functional groups.

The hydrodynamic mechanism of rainfall runoff from loess slopes treated with incorporated straw	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												The hydrodynamic parameters of rainfall runoff are important for those studying hillslope water flow, which in turn affects soil erosion, chemical pollutant migration, and diffusion. Straw incorporation into the cultivated soil layer may affect soil properties, resulting in different hydrodynamic behaviours of hillslope runoff. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influences of straw incorporation, rainfall intensity, and slope gradient on hydraulic parameters, such as the Reynolds number (Re), Froude number (Fr), Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (f), and hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient (D-H). Laboratory experiments were conducted under four straw incorporation rates (SRs: 0, 2, 4, and 8 t ha(-1)), three rainfall intensities (RIs: 80, 120, and 160 mm hr(-1)), and three slope gradients (SGs: 10, 15, and 20 degrees) to examine the hydrodynamic characteristics. The results show that the increase in SR significantly reduces the D-H. Compared with bare soil slope (0.020 m(2) s(-1)), the mean D-H decreased by half (0.011 m(2) s(-1)) at an SR of 2 t ha(-1) and approximately three-quarters (0.005 m(2) s(-1)) at an SR of 8 t ha(-1). Both Re and Fr decreased with a rise in the SR; however, the slope roughness increased, which caused a significant increase in frictional force compared to results observed for the bare soil. A rise in RI and SG increased the driving force on the farmland slope. The Re and Fr decreased with RI and SR, while f increased with RI and SG. Therefore, this study elucidates that the incorporation of straw in the soil can alter the hydrodynamic parameters, thus influencing water flow velocity and soil erosion.					huaqing, liu/ABC-5155-2020														1085-3278	1099-145X				AUG 30	2021	32	14					3812	3822		10.1002/ldr.3941	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3941		JUL 2021											WOS:000676112500001

It is considered a complicated issue in breeding programs to obtain stable and high-yielding genotypes to release new genotypes. This study was conducted to achieve a stable high-yielding genotype that is adaptive to climatic conditions of potato-producing regions in Iran. A total of 20 potato breeding lines along with five commercial varieties (Savalan, Agria, Caesar, Luta and Satina) were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with three replicates in the Agricultural Research and Natural Resources Stations of five location (Ardabil, Razavi Khorasan, Karaj, Isfahan and Hamadan) in Iran, for two years (2016 and 2017). Combined ANOVA of yield data for studied genotypes and environments indicates significant differences among potato genotypes, environments, and GE interaction was significant. Thus, the AMMI method and its parameters were used to analyze yield stability. The results indicated that only four interaction principal components were significant (P<0.01), which accounted for 81.2% of the GEI sum of squares. Based on type 1 parameters (SIPC1, FA(1), Za(1), Dz(1), EV1, and Da(1)), genotypes G7, G10, G14, G20 and G24 were identified as to be stable. Moreover, according to the results of type 2, 3 and 4 parameters, genotypes G2, G6, G7, G14, G15 and G20, as well as cultivars Agria (G24) and Luta (G23), were found to be stable. Genotypes G6, G7, G14, G15, G20, and G24 were stable according to the ASV parameter, and genotypes G6 and G7 were stable based on the MASV parameter. Amongst the stable genotypes identified by the AMMI parameters, while genotype G6 was highyielding, G14 and G24 (Agria) were moderate-yielding.

This study detects the spatiotemporal variations of individual rainfall events during a rainy season (RS) from May to September based on the hourly precipitation data measured at 87 stations on the LP from 1983 to 2012. The incidence and contribution rates were calculated for all classes of rainfall duration and intensity to identify the dominant contribution to the rainfall amount and frequency variations. The trend rates of regional mean annual total rainfall amount (ATR) and annual mean rainfall intensity (ARI) were 0.43 mm/year and 0.002 mm/h/year in the RS for 1983-2012, respectively. However, the regional mean annual total rainfall frequency (ARF) and rainfall events (ATE) were -0.27 h/year and -0.11 times/year, respectively. In terms of spatial patterns, an increase in ATR appeared in most areas except for the southwest, while the ARI increased throughout the study region, with particularly higher values in the northwest and southeast. Areas of decreasing ARF occurred mainly in the northwest and central south of the LP, while ATE was found in most areas except for the northeast. Short-duration (<= 6 h) and light rainfall events occurred mostly on the LP, accounting for 69.89% and 72.48% of total rainfall events, respectively. Long-duration (>= 7 h) and moderate rainfall events contributed to the total rainfall amount by 70.64% and 66.73% of the total rainfall amount, respectively. Rainfall frequency contributed the most to the variations of rainfall amount for light and moderate rainfall events, while rainfall intensity played an important role in heavy rainfall and rainstorms. The variation in rainfall frequency for moderate rainfall, heavy rainfall, and rainstorms is mainly affected by rainfall duration, while rainfall event was identified as a critical factor for light rainfall. The characteristics in rainfall variations on the Loess Plateau revealed in this study can provide useful information for sustainable water resources management and plans.

Global change decreased soil bacterial and fungal diversity by an average of 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively. For each global change factor, the effect sizes of precipitation(-), eN, wetting-drying cycle, and drought on soil microbial diversity were negative, whereas the effect sizes of eCO(2), warming, and precipitation(+) were positive. This phenomenon was driven by changes in mean annual temperature (MAT) and edaphic factors (especially soil pH, bulk density and organic carbon content) rather than mean annual precipitation. Moreover, the effect size of soil microbial diversity linearly declined with increasing MAT, suggesting that microbial diversity was highly dependent on climate conditions at the global scale. In addition, two- and three-way interactions of global change factors aggravated the negative effects of individual effects. We suggest that it is essential to conduct long-term, multiple-factor experiments to assess the response of soil microbial diversity to global change because multiple global change factors often occur simultaneously.

The positive effects of melatonin (MEL) on alleviation drought or osmotic stress-induced water deficiency in plants has been well reported. However, the underlying mechanism of MEL on the detailed process of plant water uptake and transport under water deficiency condition remains largely unknown. Results Application of 1 mu M MEL led to enhanced tolerance to water deficiency stress in maize seedlings, as evidenced by maintaining the higher photosynthetic parameters, leaf water status and plant transpiration rate. The relatively higher whole-plant hydraulic conductance (K-plant) and root hydraulic conductance (Lp(r)) in MEL-treated seedlings suggest that exogenous MEL alleviated water deficiency stress by promoting root water absorption. HgCl2 (aquaporin inhibitor) treatment inhibit the transpiration rate in MEL-treated plants greater than those of MEL-untreated; after recovery by dithiothreitol (DTT, anti-inhibitor), the transpiration rate in MEL-treated plants increased much higher than those of untreated plants. Moreover, under water deficiency, the transcription level of aquaporin genes was up-regulated by MEL application, and the H2O2 was less accumulated in MEL-treated root. Conclusions Exogenous MEL promoted aquaporin activity, which contributed to the maintaining of Lp(r) and K-plant under short-term water deficiency. The increased water uptake and transport lead to improved water status and thus increased tolerance to PEG-induced short-term water deficiency in maize seedlings.

Slack water pool (SWP) is an essential micro-topographic structure that has an impact on surface water and groundwater interactions in the HZ during and after high flows. However, only a few studies investigate HZ surface water and groundwater exchange in the SWP. This study used the thermal method to estimate the HZ water exchange in the SWP in a segment of the Weihe River in China during the winter season. The findings show that on the flow-direction parallel to the stream, river recharge dominates the HZ water exchange, while on the opposing flow-direction bank groundwater discharge dominates the water exchange. The water exchange in the opposing flow-direction bank is about 1.6 times of that in the flow-direction bank. The HZ water exchange is not only controlled by flow velocity but also the location and shape of the SWP. Great water exchange amount corresponds to the shape with more deformation. The maximum water exchange within the SWP is close to the river bank where the edge is relatively high. This study provides some guidelines for water resources management during flooding events.

However, the effects of RFMS on hydrothermal states and maize (Zea mays L.) yields in dry sub-humid regions remain unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of ridge-furrow construction and plastic film mulching on soil moisture and temperature, evapotranspiration (ET), maize growth and yield, water use efficiency (WUE), and thermal time use efficiency (TUE) in dry sub-humid regions of the Loess Plateau. A three-year field study was conducted in which four different planting practices were evaluated: (1) alternating wide ridges and narrow furrows with film mulching (WRM), (2) alternating equal-width ridges and furrows with film mulching (ERM), (3) equal row spacing in flat plot with half film mulching (EFM), and (4) conventional flat plot without mulching (CK). The results demonstrated that at early maize growth stages, soil water storage within the 0-200 cm soil profile and soil temperatures were increased for mulching treatments compared with CK. RFMS utilized soil water efficiently by increasing rainwater harvesting efficiency and transpiration while decreasing soil evaporation. RFMS significantly increased soil temperature in the ridges by 4.0-4.4 degrees C and reduced diurnal soil temperature amplitude in the furrows, thereby increasing soil thermal time. These positive effects of RFMS compared with CK improved maize growth and crop yields because of adequate absorption and utilization of water and thermal resources. RFMS increased average maize yield by 24.9-32.8%, WUE by 34.1-45.7%, and TUE by 15.9-21.1%. The highest grain yield, WUE, and TUE were observed with WRM due to its favorable soil hydrothermal conditions. The WRM treatment is a promising water-saving and high-yielding maize cultivation practice to improve grain yields and resource use efficiency in dry sub-humid regions.

One of the most important applications of remote sensing in agriculture is a crop acreage and production estimation (CAPE). The CAPE's main goal is to estimate crop acreage and production of important crops, so that advanced food production, distribution and supply data were achieved. Methods: Multi-temporal Sentinel 1A SAR IW- GRD data with 20 m spatial resolution and 12 days temporal resolution of vertical - horizontal (V-H) polarization were downloaded for the period of 4th October 2020 to 8th January 2021 to have the full coverage during the crop growth period in the study area used for this work. Crop backscattering and multi-temporal features were extracted from MAPscape 5.2 automated pre-processing tool and its classified using supervised maximum likelihood classification for groundnut acreage extraction for Thiruvannamalai district. Result: The rabi groundnut area of Thiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu was estimated using SAR Sentinel-1A data as 32298 ha with a higher accuracy percentage of 87.4 and kappa coefficient of 0.75.

To reveal the individual contributions of rainfall intensity and slope to splash erosion, and to distinguish the enrichment ratio of each size and the critical size in splash, loessial soil collected on the Loess Plateau in May 2019 was tested under different rainfall intensities (60, 84, 108, 132, 156 mm h-1) and slopes (0 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees). The results demonstrated that 99% of splash mass was concentrated in 0-0.4 m. Rainfall intensity was the major factor for splash according to the raindrop generation mode by rainfall simulator nozzles. The contributions of rainfall intensity to splash erosion were 82.72% and 93.24%, respectively in upslope and downslope direction. The mass percentages of effective clay and effective silt were positively correlated with rainfall intensity, while the mass percentages of effective very fine sand and effective fine sand were negatively correlated with rainfall intensity. Opposite to effective very fine sand, the mass percentages of effective clay significantly decreased with increasing distance. Rainfall intensity had significant effects on enrichment ratios, positively for effective clay and effective silt and negatively for effective very fine sand and effective fine sand. The critical effective particle size in splash for loessial soil was 50 mu m.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				OCT	2023	33	10					2113	2130		10.1007/s11442-023-2168-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-023-2168-9													WOS:001083671600008

In flowering plants, genomic imprinting predominantly occurs in the triploid endosperm and plays a vital role in seed development. In this study, we identified 248 candidate imprinted genes including 114 maternally expressed imprinted genes (MEGs) and 134 paternally expressed imprinted genes (PEGs) in flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) endosperm using deep RNA sequencing. These imprinted genes were neither clustered in specific chromosomal regions nor well conserved among flax and other plant species. MEGs tended to be expressed specifically in the endosperm, whereas the expression of PEGs was not tissue-specific. Imprinted single nucleotide polymorphisms differentiated 200 flax cultivars into the oil flax, oil-fiber dual purpose flax and fiber flax subgroups, suggesting that genomic imprinting contributed to intraspecific variation in flax. The nucleotide diversity of imprinted genes in the oil flax subgroup was significantly higher than that in the fiber flax subgroup, indicating that some imprinted genes underwent positive selection during flax domestication from oil flax to fiber flax. Moreover, imprinted genes that underwent positive selection were related to flax functions. Thirteen imprinted genes related to flax seed size and weight were identified using a candidate gene-based association study. Therefore, our study provides information for further exploration of the function and genomic variation of imprinted genes in the flax population.

The region has undulating topography, poor groundwater resources and shallow soils with low soil fertility, resulting in frequent crop failures. A study was undertaken to assess the potential of bamboo-based agroforestry system to enhance productivity and economic returns at the research farm of ICAR-Central Agroforestry Research Institute, Jhansi (Uttar Pradesh), India, which lies in the Bundelkhand region of central India. The 7-year study (2007-2015) recorded 2906 number of bamboo culms ha(-1) at 10 m x 10 m spacing compared to 2409 culms under 12 m x 10 m spacing. Averaged over 3 years (5th, 6th and 7th year), bamboo culm yield from agroforestry (Dendrocalamus strictus + Sesamum indicum-Cicer arietinum)/(bamboo + sesame-chickpea) was higher by 3.20 and 4.96% over sole bamboo in 12 m x 10 m and 10 m x 10 m, respectively. The intercrop productivity started declining from 3rd year onwards, and the extent of reduction in productivity was to the tune of 26.1, 23.7, 24.2, 17.4 and 17.4% during the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th year, respectively. From 5th year onwards, the harvested bamboo culms contributed to the improvement in the system productivity and it was 29 and 236% higher than the sole crops and sole bamboo, respectively, during the 7th year. Financial analysis showed that bamboo-based agroforestry system (bamboo + sesame-chickpea) planted at 12 m x 10m spacing was having high land equivalent ratio (1.95-2.14) and was more profitable than arable cropping and sole bamboo. Therefore, the Dendrocalamus strictus-based agroforestry system can be a potential alternative to arable cropping in semi-arid tropics of central India to enhance productivity and economic returns.

Determining the predictor that can represent the effects of biocrusts on water erosion and the relationship between this predictor and water erosion is the key to solving this problem. Accordingly, we sampled 20 undisturbed biocrust samples from 10 slopes in the Loess Plateau region of China, representing a developmental sequence and used rainfall simulation to explore the effects of biocrust development on soil loss under water erosion. The results showed that the moss percentage cover was a better predictor than cyanobacterial or moss biomass to predict the resistance of biocrust covered soil to water erosion. As expected, there was a strong negative relationship between sediment concentration and moss cover. Effect of biocrust development on water erosion can be divided into two stages, based on a threshold moss cover of 35% beyond which water erosion was completely prevented. Where moss cover was below 35%, sediment concentration decreased logarithmically along with the increase of moss coverage. Biocrusts controlled water erosion through two tightly correlated mechanisms, decreasing erodibility (the K factor) and enhancing cover of the soil surface (the C factor). Increasing moss cover appears to induce a cascade of changes in soil organic matter, texture and organic carbon. All of these factors jointly control water erosion. Accounting for the effect of biocrusts in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation is essential, and we recommend that the most practical way of doing so is to ensure that the effect of biocrust cover, particularly moss cover, is more effectively and consistently taken into account when estimating the C factor. The results of this study will provide a scientific basis for the selection of parameters considering the biocrust effects in soil erosion models.

The effect of LU on soil quality is acute in water limited systems that are characterized by insufficient availability of soil organic resources. Thus, the main objective of this study was to assess the effects of human activities (i.e., land-uses as grazing, modern agriculture, and runoff harvesting systems) on soil quality using imaging spectroscopy (IS) in the arid regions of Israel. For this, 12 physical, biological, and chemical soil properties were selected and further integrated into the soil quality index (SQI) as a method to assess the significant effects of LU changes in an arid area in southern Israel. A flight campaign of the AisaFENIX hyperspectral airborne sensor was used to develop an IS prediction model for the SQI on a regional scale. The spectral signatures, extracted from the hyperspectral image itself, were well separable among the four LUs using the partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) classification method (OA = 95.31%, Kc = 0.90). The correlation was performed using multivariate support vector machine regression (SVM-R) models between the spectral data and the measured soil indicators and the overall SQI. The SVM-R models were significantly correlated for several soil properties, including the overall SQI (R(adj)(2)Val = 0.87), with the successful prediction of the regional SQI mapping (R(adj)(2)Pred = 0.78). Seven individual soil properties, including fractional sand and clay, SOM, pH, EC, SAR, and P, were successfully used for developing prediction maps. Applying IS, and statistically integrative methods for comprehensive soil quality assessments enhances the prediction accuracy for monitoring soil health and evaluating degradation processes in arid environments. This study establishes a precise tool for sustainable and efficient land management and could be an example for future potential IS earth-observing space missions for soil quality assessment studies and applications.

Knowledge of the distribution and disappearance of BSCs is vital for the management of ecosystems and for desertification researches. However, the major remote sensing approaches used to extract BSCs are multispectral indices, which lack accuracy, and hyperspectral indices, which have lower data availability and require a higher computational effort. This study employs random forest (RF) models to optimize the extraction of BSCs using band combinations similar to the two multispectral BSC indices (Crust Index-CI; Biological Soil Crust Index-BSCI), but covering all possible band combinations. Simulated multispectral datasets resampled from in-situ hyperspectral data were used to extract BSC information. Multispectral datasets (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets) were then used to detect BSC coverage in Mu Us Sandy Land, located in northern China, where BSCs dominated by moss are widely distributed. The results show that (i) the spectral curves of moss-dominated BSCs are different from those of other typical land surfaces, (ii) the BSC coverage can be predicted using the simulated multispectral data (mean square error (MSE) < 0.01), (iii) Sentinel-2 satellite datasets with CI-based band combinations provided a reliable RF model for detecting moss-dominated BSCs (10-fold validation, R-2 = 0.947; ground validation, R-2 = 0.906). In conclusion, application of the RF algorithm to the Sentinel-2 dataset can precisely and effectively map BSCs dominated by moss. This new application can be used as a theoretical basis for detecting BSCs in other arid and semi-arid lands within desert ecosystems.

Hence, four production scenarios viz., integrated organic management, integrated crop management, conservation agriculture, and conventional system and three cropping system viz., maize-mustard, maize + cowpea-mustard, and pigeon peawheat were tested to examine their energy, carbon, and economic feasibility for the development of environmentally clean production system. The integrated crop management system recorded significantly higher system productivity (12621 kg ha- 1), net energy (471632 MJ ha- 1), and economic returns (US$ 2079 ha-1). However, the integrated organic management system resulted in the highest energy productivity (0.83 kg MJ-1), ecoefficiency (0.18 US$ MJ- 1ha- 1), carbon economic efficiency (2.47 US$ ha- 1CO2-eq), and carbon sustainability index (37.5), and the lowest greenhouse gas intensity (0.06 kg grain kg- 1CO2eq). Among the cropping systems, maize + cowpea-mustard produced 32.6% higher net energy and 31.1% higher energy use efficiency over the maize-mustard system, respectively. However, the pigeonpea -wheat system recorded the highest carbon economic efficiency (1.41 US$ kg- 1 CO2eq), and carbon sustainability index (24.4). The greenhouse gases intensity was positively (+) correlated with specific energy but negatively (-) correlated with carbon ecological efficiency, C-gain, and carbon sustainability index. Thus, the study suggested that the intensified cropping is profitable and environmentally clean systems either in integrated crop management or in integrated organic management scenarios.

Most studies have focused on leaf litter decomposition, but thus far, there has been little information on the dynamic changes in soil microbial composition at the different stages of fine-root decomposition. Therefore, we conducted a 210-day incubation experiment on the fine roots of Robinia pseudoacacia to explore how the temporal dynamics of soil enzyme activities and microbial communities are related to the decomposition of R. pseudoacacia at four different stand ages (15, 25, 35 and 45 years) during vegetation restoration. The results showed that the fine-root decomposition rate was higher for young stands of R. pseudoacacia. We found that the oxidase activity was significantly higher in the young stands (15 and 25 years) than in the old stands (35 and 45 years), while the hydrolase activity showed the opposite trend. The main reason for the higher decomposition rate in young stands of R. pseudoacacia was the high oxidase enzyme activities and less complex but more specialized microbial network of younger stands. The occurrence network was used to identify the keystone taxa by statistical analysis, and the key taxa changed from Acidobacteria to Proteobacteria during vegetation restoration. These findings demonstrate that vegetation restoration alters the soil microor-ganism community and network structure during fine-root decomposition of R. pseudoacacia. This finding is of great significance for understanding the role of microorganisms in regulating fine-root decomposition dynamics.

However, there are increasing concerns regarding the sustainability of plantation ecosystems under climate change. In this study, we developed tree-ring width chronologies of Pinus tabulaeformis at seven sites along a precipitation gradient from south to north in the LP. Correlation analysis was performed to investigate the climate (temperature, precipitation, self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index)-growth relationship. Moreover, the tree resilience components were computed to study the adaptability of trees to extreme drought during the growth periods. The results showed that the differences in radial growth to climate change along the precipitation gradient and the cluster analysis of the tree ring width index (RWI)-scPDSI correlation coefficient illustrated that the climate-growth response pattern along the LP was divided into southern and northern regions. Tree growth in the southern region is limited by humid environment conditions, while tree growth in the early and middle growing seasons of the northern region is limited by warming-induced drought. As the temperature rising over the past fifty years, the growth was found to be negatively correlated with temperature, especially in the spring and autumn seasons of the northern region. In contrast, the effect of precipitation on tree growth became more negative in the southern region, but more positive in the middle and late growing seasons of the northern region. Moreover, tree resilience analysis showed that the high resistance of Pinus tabulaeformis in the southern region, whereas high recovery in the northern region. It was difficult for the growth of Pinus tabulaeformis to recover from drought in the southern region, but stronger adaptability to extreme drought events in the northern region. Our study illustrated that there are different climate response patterns and limiting factors of Pinus tabulaeformis along the precipitation gradient in the LP; thus, different ecological restoration and regional forestry management strategies should be initiated in the LP.

Sediment deposition changes the relationship between soil organic and inorganic carbon: Evidence from the Chinese Loess Plateau	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Soil erosion has a significant impact on the distribution and sequestration of soil carbon, affecting the global C cycle. Although the transport and transformation of soil organic carbon (SOC) during the erosion process have been widely studied, there is still a lack of understanding of the impacts of soil erosion on soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and its relationships with SOC. In this study, 62 erosional sites (including 16 gullies, 17 grasslands, 16 forestlands and 13 croplands) and 35 depositional sites (check dams) on the Chinese Loess Plateau were selected. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was carried out to explore the main influential factors of SIC variation. The results showed that, compared with erosional sites, the mean SOC and SIC content in depositional sites (0-25 cm) increased by 24.4 % and 15.4 %, respectively. Both SOC and SIC contents in depositional sites exhibited a decreasing tendency with depth. SIC was significantly negatively correlated with SOC (R-2 = 0.25, P < 0.01) across all erosional sites (0-25 cm). In contrast, SIC was significantly positively correlated with SOC in all depositional layers beneath 100 cm (P < 0.05), and R-2 increased from 0.23 (100-200 cm) to 0.68 (300-400 cm) and then decreased to 0.46 (500-600 cm). Sediment transport and deposition converted the negative relationship between SOC and SIC in the erosional sites to a positive relationship in deep depositional soil. The PLSR analysis suggested that SOC had an important (VIP > 1) positive impact on predicting SIC in depositional sites, which indicated that SOC increase contributed to enhancing SIC accumulation under the depositional conditions in the semi-arid region. We believe that the influencing mechanism of soil erosion on the relationship between SOC and SIC revealed in this study will contribute to understanding the soil C cycle.

Distribution of C<sub>4</sub> Plants of the Chenopodiaceae Family According to the Salinization Profile of the Kyzylkum Desert	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY												The peculiarities of the prevalence of C-4 species in the relief of the Kyzylkum Desert were revealed based on botanical and geographical descriptions. In the lowlands (0-50 m above sea level), a predominance of C-3 halophytes was found, while halophytes with C-4 photosynthesis began to predominate at medium elevations (50-200 m above sea level). Above 200 m above sea level, a sharp decline in the contribution of halophilic flora to the biodiversity of native vegetation was detected. Thus, the penetration of halophytes above 200 m is limited by the presence of C-4 photosynthesis as an adaptive characteristic to soil desalinization. Adecrease in the succulence of leaf morphology in edificatory perennial plants of the Kyzylkum Desert (tamarix, saxaul, and camel thorn) was noted with a decrease in soil salinization. In the summer dry period, C(4)photosynthesis provides a competitive advantage over C-3 halophytes for survival on desalinated soils of elevated parts of the terrain desiccated during the summer. It was concluded that the acquisition of C-4 photosynthesis by halophilic species is an adaptation of the photosynthesis of halophilic flora to seasonal desalinization and drying of the soil of the elevated parts of the Kyzylkum Desert.

Maintaining a diversity of arthropods in an urban environment can enhance the functions they fill, such as pest control and soil development. Theory suggests that the creation of a heterogeneous environment on green roofs would enhance arthropod diversity. Several studies have examined how arthropod diversity can be enhanced on green roofs, and particularly whether substrate properties affect the arthropod community, but a gap remains in identifying the effect of substrate heterogeneity within a green roof on the arthropod community. In this paper, it is hypothesized that creating heterogeneity in the substrate would directly affect the diversity and abundance of some arthropod taxa, and indirectly increase arthropod diversity through increased plant diversity. These hypotheses were tested using green roof plots in four treatments of substrate heterogeneity: (1) homogeneous dispersion; (2) mineral heterogeneity-with increased tuff concentration in subplots; (3) organic heterogeneity-with decreased compost concentrations in subplots; (4) both mineral and organic heterogeneity. Each of the four treatments was replicated twice on each of three roofs (six replicates per treatment) in a Mediterranean region. There was no effect of substrate heterogeneity on arthropod diversity, abundance, or community composition, but there were differences in arthropod communities among roofs. This suggests that the location of a green roof, which can differ in local climatic conditions, can have a strong effect on the composition of the arthropod community. Thus, arthropod diversity may be promoted by building green roofs in a variety of locations throughout a city, even if the roof construction is similar on all roofs.

Science-based decision support for formulating crop fertilizer recommendations in sub-Saharan Africa	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												In sub-Saharan Africa, there is considerable spatial and temporal variability in relations between nutrient application and crop yield, due to varying inherent soil nutrients supply, soil moisture, crop management and germplasm. This variability affects fertilizer use efficiency and crop productivity. Therefore, development of decision systems that support formulation and delivery of site-specific fertilizer recommendations is important for increased crop yield and environmental protection. Nutrient Expert (NE) is a computer-based decision support system, which enables extension advisers to generate field- or area-specific fertilizer recommendations based on yield response to fertilizer and nutrient use efficiency. We calibrated NE for major maize agroecological zones in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania, with data generated from 735 on-farm nutrient omission trials conducted between 2015 and 2017. Between 2016 and 2018, 368 NE performance trials were conducted across the three countries in which recommendations generated with NE were evaluated relative to soil-test based recommendations, the current blanket fertilizer recommendations and a control with no fertilizer applied. Although maize yield response to fertilizer differed with geographic location; on average, maize yield response to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) were respectively 2.4, 1.6 and 0.2 t ha(-1) in Nigeria, 2.3, 0.9 and 0.2 t ha(-1) in Ethiopia, and 1.5, 0.8 and 0.2 t ha(-1) in Tanzania. Secondary and micronutrients increased maize yield only in specific areas in each country. Agronomic use efficiencies of N were 18, 22 and 13 kg grain kg(-1) N, on average, in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Tanzania, respectively. In Nigeria, NE recommended lower amounts of P by 9 and 11 kg ha(-1) and K by 24 and 38 kg ha(-1) than soil-test based and regional fertilizer recommendations, respectively. Yet maize yield (4 t ha(-1)) was similar among the three methods. Agronomic use efficiencies of P and K (300 and 250 kg kg(-1), respectively) were higher with NE than with the blanket recommendation (150 and 70 kg kg(-1)). In Ethiopia, NE and soil-test based respectively recommended lower amounts of P by 8 and 19 kg ha(-1) than the blanket recommendations, but maize yield (6 t ha(-1)) was similar among the three methods. Overall, fertilizer recommendations generated with NE maintained high maize yield, but at a lower fertilizer input cost than conventional methods. NE was effective as a simple and cost-effective decision support tool for fine-tuning fertilizer recommendations to farm-specific conditions and offers an alternative to soil testing, which is hardly available to most smallholder farmers.

Soil extracellular enzyme stoichiometry reflects the shift from P- to N-limitation of microorganisms with grassland restoration	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Soil extracellular enzyme stoichiometry (EES), the ratio of extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) related to the acquisition of nutrients such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), reflects the demand for resources by microorganisms. However, how grassland restoration shifts microbial nutrient limitation as indicated by soil EES remains unclear. Here, we evaluated microbial nutrient limitation by studying soil EES across a chronosequence of grassland restoration sites. The ratio of the natural logarithm of C-, N-, and P-acquiring enzymes in our studied system ranged from 1:1.47:1.05 to 1:0.82:1.38, and the average was 1:1.08:1.28, deviating from the global ratio of 1:1:1 and indicating that microorganisms were co-limited by N and P. Enzyme N:P ratio increased and vector angles decreased with time since restoration, suggesting that the restored grassland shifted from P-limitation (angles>45 degrees ) to N-limitation (angles<45 degrees ), and N limitation gradually exacerbated over time. Strong relationships between microbial biomass C:N:P ratios and soil EES suggest that soil EES was dependent on microbial resource availability. We also found that the variation in soil EES was better explained by biotic than by abiotic factors, and the total variation explained increased with time since restoration, indicating that biotic control over soil EES increased over time as the environmental conditions such as soil moisture availability and nutrients improved for microorganisms. Overall, this study highlights the utility of the ecoenzymatic stoichiometry approach in assessing relationships in microbial resource ecology, and such insights provide guidance in developing restoration strategies such as the need for nutrient management in grassland ecosystems.

However, solar radiation is usually influenced by three groups of dynamic factors: sun-earth position, terrain, and atmospheric effects. Therefore, an integrated approach to accurately consider the impacts of those dynamic factors on solar radiation is essential to estimate solar radiation over rugged terrain. In this study, a spatial and temporal gap-filling algorithm was proposed to obtain a seamless daily MODIS albedo dataset. A 1 km-resolution digital elevation model was used to model the impact of local topography and shading by surrounding terrain on solar radiation. A sunshine-based model was adopted to simulate radiation under the influence of clouds. A GIS-based solar radiation model that incorporates albedo, shading by surrounding terrain, and variations in cloudiness was used to address the spatial variability of these factors in mountainous terrain. Compared with other independent solar radiation products, our model generated a more reliable solar radiation product over rugged terrain, with an R-2 of 0.88 and an RMSE of 2.55 MJ m(-2) day(-1). The improved solar radiation products and open source app can be used further in practice or scientific research.

Here we examined how litter N:P ratios affected decomposer community composition and nutrient release for two contrasting tree species in the Qinling Mountains, China. Methods Two-year-old Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata and Pinus tabulaeformis seedlings were fertilized using nutrient solutions with varying N:P ratios for four months. The obtained litters with contrasting N:P stoichiometry were left to decompose on nutrient-free quartz sand for 12 weeks with microbial inoculum. Then, the post-decomposition microbial community composition was determined using a phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Results The Q. aliena litter stoichiometry was more homeostatic than P. tabulaeformis litter. Litter N:P ratio was significantly related to litter nutrient loss and mass loss for P. tabulaeformis but not always for Q. aliena. The soil microbial community compositions showed larger fungal to bacterial (F:B) ratios with increasing litter N:P ratios for Q. aliena but not P. tabulaeformis. Conclusion Litter N:P ratio, as determined by species-specific homeostasis, showed an interspecific difference to affect the patterns of litter decomposition dynamics, as well as related soil microbial community composition. The less variation in the soil microbial community composition than plant litter stoichiometric characteristics during decomposition is likely an important mechanism that regulates the balance of biogeochemical cycles in the Qinling Mountains.

Cactus pear and Lantana camara fruits have well-known nutritive and health benefits. The purpose of this study was to investigate cactus wine quality improvement by applying response surface optimization method of cactus pear and Lantana camara fruits juice fermentation process. Wine quality responses were optimized at an experimental strategy developed using central composite rotatory design by varying fermentation process variable temperature, inoculum, and Lantana camara fruit juice concentration for six days. The developed fermentation models were significant (p < 0.01) to predict alcohol, total phenol content, and sensory property of the final wine accurately. From the statistics calculations, fermentation temperature of 24.8 degrees C, inoculum concentration 10.16% (v/v), and Lantana camara fruit juice concentration of 10.66% (v/v) were the overall optimum values to produce cactus pear fruit wine with alcohol 9.53 +/- 0.84% (v/v), total phenol content 651.6 +/- 54 (mg L-1 equivalent to gallic acid), and sensory value of 8:83 +/- 0.29. The Lantana camara fruit juice concentration added had shown significant (p < 0.05) enhancement on total phenol content and sensory values of the final wine. The results can be used for large-scale wine production in order to reduce its postharvest losses.

In some cases, models have such prohibitively high data requirements that they are only applicable with far-reaching and often questionable assumptions. In this paper, we demonstrate a customizable solution-oriented approach for crop modelling in situations where data and resources are limited. To address system complexity and produce a probabilistic crop model that does not depend on precise data, we used participatory analysis to describe system components using individual Bayesian networks that formalize expert knowledge into probabilistic causal relationships among important variables. We then used these Bayesian networks to generate inputs for a Monte Carlo model that illustrates the determinants of crop growth and simulates plausible ranges of expected grain and biomass yields at various stages of crop development. The resulting model accounts for all important variables and their interactions, as examined by local and foreign experts and described in relevant literature. We describe how to develop and customize such a model to specific situations based on case studies related to flood-based farming systems in Ethiopia and Kenya. The model assesses the performance of cropping systems and individual crops, and identifies factors of high importance for system outcomes. This approach to crop modelling paves the way for new opportunities to support agricultural decisions, since it does not require perfect information and can accommodate system complexity and uncertainty in data-poor environments.

Here, we investigated the changes in the soil properties over time, focusing on organic acid content in restoration areas following coal mining. The soil of three soil depths (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) from natural land and three waste dumps with primary succession ages of 5 (R5), 10 (R10), and 20 (R20) years in the Heidaigou open-pit coal mine of Northwest China, were analyzed to examine changes in the soil properties and to highlight relationships between these properties. Results showed soil pH, total nitrogen, alkali -hydrolyzable nitrogen, available phosphorus, soil organic matter, and organic acid increased with increasing restoration age. However, only soil organic matter and organic acid were influenced by soil depth and the interaction of restoration age and soil depth. Moreover, the total phosphorus content did not alter with the restoration age, soil depth, or their interactions. In contrast, the N:P ratio increased with increasing restoration age, indicating that the total phosphorus content might restrict restoration. The alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen was significantly correlated to available phosphorus, acetic acid, soil organic matter, and pH. The available phos-phorus was significantly correlated to the oxalic acid, while the pH and soil organic matter significantly influ-enced the acetic acid. Our findings provide theoretical support to improve the soil quality and may assist in restoration in coal dam areas.					yan, jiakun/GRJ-3297-2022; liu, pu/HOH-6399-2023	yan, jiakun/0000-0001-8844-6098; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				NOV	2022	218								106567	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106567	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106567		AUG 2022											WOS:000849670200001

Naphthalene dithiol additive reduces trap-assisted recombination and improves outdoor operational stability of organic solar cells	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS												While high efficiencies were achieved for organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, the commercialization of this technology requires addressing the challenge of long-term device stability. The application of stabilizers is one of the promising approaches to suppress OPV degradation since it is inexpensive and easily scalable. However, only limited progress has been achieved in the development of such stabilizing additives. Herein, we proposed and practically evaluated naphthalene dithiol (NDT) as a promising stabilizing additive, which mimics the action of the natural glutathione system scavenging radicals and reactive oxygen species in animals. Using NDT did not lead to any significant drop in the characteristics of the assembled solar cells, whereas the operational stability was improved: the devices maintained more than 90% of their initial efficiency after 200 h of outdoor aging under real sunlight illumination in the Negev desert. A decrease in the non-geminate recombination has been achieved by reducing the number of traps and suppressing their formation in the course of device operation. These results suggest that using NDT as a stabilizing additive might facilitate the development of the OPV technology with the required long device operational lifetimes.

The objective of this study was to identify the responses of soil water holding capacity (SWHC) and soil water availability (SWA) to land use type (grassland, shrubland and forestland). The soil water characteristic curve describes the relationship between gravimetric water content and soil suction. We measured the soil water characteristic parameters representing SWHC and SWA, which we derived from soil water characteristic curves, in the 0-50 cm soil layer at sites representing three land use types in the Ziwuling forest region, located in the central part of the Loess Plateau, China. Our results showed that the SWHC was higher at the woodland site than the grassland and shrubland, and there was no significant difference between the latter two sites, the trend of SWA was similar to the SWHC. From grassland to woodland, the soil physical properties in the 0-50 cm soil layer partially improved, BD was significantly higher at the grassland site than at the shrubland and woodland sites, the clay and silt contents decreased significantly from grassland to shrubland to woodland and sand content showed the opposite pattern, the soil porosity was higher in the shrubland and woodland than that in the grassland, the soil physical properties across the 0-50 cm soil layer improved. Soil texture, porosity and bulk density were the key factors affecting SWHC and SWA. The results of this study provide insight into the effects of vegetation restoration on local hydrological resources and can inform soil water management and land use planning on the Chinese Loess Plateau.

ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE												Selenium (Se) is an essential nutrient for humans and animals, but is toxic at high concentrations in leaves. It is chemically similar to phosphorus (P), an essential plant macronutrient. The objective of this pot experiment was to investigate the effects of P- and Se-application rate on alfalfa growth and P and Se uptake in loessial soil, and reveal the changing processes of soil P and Se fractions. The results indicated that Se concentration in alfalfa was significantly influenced by the interaction of P- and Se-application rate. In the loessial soil, an optimal P- and Se-application rate is 5 mg kg(-1) and 2 mg kg(-1), respectively for plant growth and the maximum P and Se accumulation in alfalfa. Besides, concentrations of exchangeable Se and organic-matter-bound Se in soil decreased, as the P-application rate increased, whereas concentrations of soluble Se and iron oxide-bound Se increased. The addition of P fertilizer reduced soil pH, affecting the changing processes of soil P and Se fractions, thus promoting the activation of Fe-P and the transformation of exchangeable Se to iron oxide-bound Se. These findings will help in understanding of forage P and Se accumulation and provide the guide for cultivating Se-enriched forage.

The mixed application of controlled-release urea and normal urea (CRUNU) is a potential nitrogen (N) management strategy for achieving this goal. However, few studies have focused on whether optimizing the N application rate of CRUNU can balance crop yield and greenhouse gas emissions, especially when straw is returned. Thus, we conducted a five-year field experiment in a winter wheat-summer maize planting system in Northwest China to determine the effects of different N fertilizer types (NU: normal urea; CRUNU) and N application levels (low N, 135 kg ha(-1); medium N, 180 kg ha(-1); high N, 225 kg ha(-1)) with straw return on the crop yield and stability, N fertilizer partial factor productivity (NFPF), and soil organic carbon (SOC). Life cycle assessment was also conducted to quantify the GHG emissions from farmland and carbon footprint (CF). Compared with NU, CRUNU improved the winter wheat and summer maize grain yield, biomass, and NFPF at all three N application levels. The crop grain yields increased significantly as the N application level increased under NU, but the crop grain yields did not differ significantly between the medium and high N application levels under CRUNU (P > 0.05). The SOC contents increased as the duration of straw return increased. Compared with NU, CRUNU significantly increased the SOC content, and correlation analysis showed that this increase was related to the increased amount of returned straw. Compared with NU, CRUNU increased the GHG emissions in the production process but reduced the GHG emissions in the application process, as well as increasing soil CO2 fixation to ultimately reduce the total GHG emissions. CRUNU increased the crop grain yield while also reducing the total GHG emissions, and thus the CF decreased significantly by 14.53-23.03% compared with NU, especially at the medium N application level. Therefore, this comprehensive analysis of the crop productivity and GHG emissions indicates that CRUNU combined with an appropriate N application level can be used as a nitrogen fertilizer management strategy for sustainable winter wheat-summer maize cropping in Northwest China.																			1161-0301	1873-7331				NOV	2023	151								127002	10.1016/j.eja.2023.127002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2023.127002		OCT 2023											WOS:001100686900001

(P) mono-cropping system is a practical approach to provide forage yield and increase the resource use efficiency. However, little information about the comprehensive assessment of water utilization and economic benefits in the crop-livestock system exists for the North China Plain (NCP). This study aims to identify the crop rotation for optimizing water management and enhance economic benefit. The field experiment was performed over three years (2011-2014) to assess production, water utilization, and economic benefits when inserting forage triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) (T) into the peanut mono-cropping system. Results showed that replacing the fallow F-P cropping system with forage triticale provided a substantial amount of forage (the average of 9.8 t ha(-1) per year) and enhanced the average system productivity by 85.1%. Cultivation of forage triticale during the fallow period decreased the subsequent peanut pod yield by 8.3% due to a 19.3% decline in soil water storage capacity during the sowing stage of peanut. Replacing fallow with forage triticale increased the system net income by 1016.2 US$ ha(-1) and the water use efficiency (WUE) by 30.0%, while not affecting the economic efficiency of water use (EEWU), and thus can be recommended as a better option for maintaining relatively high system production, economic benefit, and WUE in NCP.

The EC was conducted using iron electrodes and utilizing Congo Red (CR) dye as a model pollutant. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to investigate the effect of operational parameters (initial dye concentration, pH and inter-electrode distance) and optimize the process. To provide insight into the process mechanism, quantum chemical analysis and FTIR were utilized. The process achieved 89% and 97% COD and color removal respectively under optimum conditions (1000 mg/L initial dye concentration, pH 3 and 3 cm inter-electrode distance). The electrical energy required to achieve the optimum COD removal was estimated to be about 36.9 kJ. The quantum analysis showed that CR with HOMO energy of - 5.58 eV and Fe3+ LUMO energy of -15.09 eV exhibit electron donating and electron accepting tendency respectively. In addition, Fe3+ shares its LUMO with the HOMO of HO- due to the lower energy gap of - 19.47 eV, which leads to the formation of monomeric coagulant such as Fe(OH) 3 and the subsequent polymeric flocculants including Fe-2(OH)(2)(4+) and Fe-6(OH)(15)(3+). The FTIR analysis of the sludge indicates the presence of coagulant species i.e. Fe(OH)(3), Fe(OH)(2+), Fe(OH)(2)(+) and Fe-2(OH)(2)(4+) that are generated from the EC. The findings of this study show that quantum chemical analysis and RSM are suitable for investigating the mechanism and optimization of EC as applied to textile effluents.

In this study, five typical land-cover types (forest, shrub, grass, crop and bare land) and four rainfall patterns (heavy, intermediate, light and continuous rains) were selected to assess the effects of SM response characteristics on the Loess Plateau of China. We monitored SM at five depths on each land-cover type at 1-h intervals over the growing season of 2019. The results showed that rainfall patterns and land-cover types together determined the SM response process and infiltration efficiency. A minimum accumulated rainfall amount of 5 mm was the threshold required to trigger a 10-cm SM response. Rain events with a higher intensity and smaller total rainfall amount triggered a quick surface SM response, while larger amounts could percolate deeper and faster. Land-cover change significantly altered the rainfall-SM response dynamics and rainwater utilization efficiency after 20 years of ecological construction. Revegetation sites (mean values of forest, shrub and grass) increased the soil wetting depth by 14.7%, shortened the SM response time by 27.3%, and accelerated the SM wetting front velocity by 67.2%, which promoted a 35.2% rainfall transformation rate (RTR) across the 1-m profile over all rainfall events (R1-13). Moreover, planted forest showed the highest RTR of R1-13 and the maximal increase in soil water storage, which did not aggravate the soil water deficit across the 1-m profile over the growing season. Therefore, we present evidence that planted forests, instead of shrubs, may be beneficial for water conservation if precipitation is greater than 550 mm. The findings of this study prove the role of revegetation on rainwater infiltration capacity and efficiency and can help improve the management of afforestation in arid and semiarid regions.

We set four measurement plots with different vegetation compositions: plot 1 on bare sand; plot 2 on a cluster of young Vitex rotundifolia seedlings; plot 3 on a mixture of Artemisia capillaris and V. rotundifolia; and plot 4 on the inland boundary between the coastal vegetation zone and a Pinus thunbergii forest. R-s increased exponentially along with the seasonal rise in soil temperature, but summer drought stress markedly decreased R-s in plots 3 and 4. There was a significant positive correlation between the natural logarithm of belowground plant biomass and R-s in autumn. Our findings indicate that the seasonal dynamics of R-s in this coastal dune ecosystem are controlled by abiotic factors (soil temperature and soil moisture), but the response of R-s to drought stress in summer varied among plots that differed in dominant vegetation species. Our findings also indicated that the spatial dynamics of R-s are mainly controlled by the distribution of belowground plant biomass and autotrophic respiration.

J	Zou, YW; Huang, X; Hou, MT; She, DL				Zou Yuwen; Huang Xuan; Hou Meiting; She Dongli			Linking watershed hydrologic processes to connectivity indices on the Loess Plateau, China	CATENA												Sediment connectivity is an important property influencing landscape evolution. Understanding the link between sediment connectivity and hydrologic processes plays an important role in developing strategies for soil and water conservation measures. Based on 10 years of observations for 30 hydrologically monitored watersheds on the Loess Plateau, measurements for 926 hydrologic events were analyzed and the index of connectivity (IC) was calculated. The high-frequency runoff and sediment data were analyzed, and a normalized hysteresis index (HI) was calculated to assess the dominant hysteresis patterns for each watershed. Correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between IC and HI. The results showed that the watersheds with low IC values were located in regions with dense vegetation and flat terrain and were dominated mainly by a clockwise hysteresis pattern, while the watersheds with high IC values were located in regions with sparse vegetation and steep terrain and were dominated by an anticlockwise hysteresis pattern. The anticlockwise hysteresis pattern was the most frequent and the most efficient type in terms of sediment transport among the 30 watersheds. The anticlockwise hysteresis type was more likely to occur as the IC values increased. A significant negative correlation was observed between the IC values and HI values during small and medium hydrologic events. The link is correlated with the notion that the separation into two components in connectivity indexes are similar to the two sediment sources controlling the hysteresis type. The outcomes from this study are helpful for determining the relationship between sediment connectivity and hydrologic behavior and thus for providing insight into the hydrologic processes that are essential to facilitate sustainable watershed management.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				SEP	2022	216		A						106341	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106341	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106341		MAY 2022											WOS:000829817900001

However, most of the previous studies on soil CO2 emissions were conducted on flat land. In regions with complex terrains and fragmented fields with terraces, such as the Chinese Loess Plateau, it is particularly important to understand slope dependent soil CO2 emissions. This requires investigations to unravel the relationship between soil erosional responses and CO2 emissions on different slopes. In this study, erosion plots, set at angles of 0.5 degrees, 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 20 degrees, were refilled with loess soils from local farmland on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Changes of soil properties and CO2 emission rates were measured at three positions (upper, middle, lower) on each plot from October 2014 to September 2015. Our results show that greater runoff from the steeper slopes evidently depleted soil water and nutrients, directly responsible for the less soil CO2 emissions. Furthermore, the average yearly soil CO2 emissions decreased exponentially with slope gradients, from approximately 832.7 g m(-2) yr(-1) on the 0.5 degrees slope, to 380.9 g m(-2) yr(-1) when the slope gradient was 20 degrees. This not only proves the dependency of soil CO2 emission to slope gradients, but also provides the fundamental dataset to develop an empirical model between slope gradients and soil CO2 emissions. A coefficient beta has been parameterized for the first time in this study to represent the sensitivity of soil CO2 emissions to slope gradients. The model of slope-dependent CO2 emissions identified in this study tentatively demonstrate non-negligible implications for global carbon fluxes from sloped and terraced field to the atmosphere. Further investigations on slope-scale carbon balances should test and integrate topography specific CO2 emissions.

Therefore, several multispectral indices have been proposed to map the spatial distribution and coverage of BSCs. BSCs are composed of poikilohydric organisms, the activity of which is sensitive to water availability. However, studies on dry and wet BSCs have seldom considered the mixed coverage gradient that is representative of actual field conditions. In this study, in situ spectral data and photographs of 136 pairs of dry and wet plots were collected to determine the influence of moisture conditions on BSC coverage detection. Then, BSC spectral reflectance and continuum removal (CR) reflectance responses to wetting were analyzed. Finally, the responses of four commonly used indices (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); crust index (CI); biological soil crust index (BSCI); and band depth of absorption feature after CR in the red band, (BD_red)), calculated from in situ hyperspectral data resampled to two multispectral data channels (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2), were compared in dry and wet conditions. The results indicate that: (i) on average, the estimated BSC coverage using red-green-blue (RGB) images is 14.98% higher in wet than in dry conditions (P < 0.001); (ii) CR reflectance features of wet BSCs are more obvious than those of dry BSCs in both red and red-edge bands; and (iii) NDVI, CI, and BSCI for BSC coverage of 0%-60% under dry and wet conditions are close to those of dry and wet bare sand, respectively. NDVI and BD_red cannot separate dead wood and BSC with low coverage. This study demonstrates that low-coverage moss-dominated BSC is not easily detected by the four indices. In the future, remote-sensing data obtained during the rainy season with red and red-edge bands should be considered to detect BSCs.

Over the past 6 years, the semiarid regions of the Loess Plateau in China have experienced a transition from wet to dry years, but little is known about the response of grass growth to this change. Thus, this study aimed to analyze and evaluate the effect of climate change on grass growth. Using observed climate data and leaf area index (LAI) data obtained with hemispherical photography from 2016 to 2021, we investigated changes in trends of five climatic factors, including precipitation (P), temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), and solar radiation (R-s), and their impact on the growth of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and Stipa bungeana plantations in the semiarid area of the Loess Plateau. The results showed a tendency to become colder in spring and drier in summer and autumn. In response, LAI tended to decrease in alfalfa and S. bungeana plots with interannual variation rates of 0.21 year(-1) and 0.12 year(-1), respectively. Additionally, linear regression methods showed that P had the greatest effect on LAI of two grasslands during the growing season (R-2 > 0.84, p < 0.01), followed by RH and T (0.30 < R-2 < 0.50, p < 0.01), a negative effect of WS (R-2 = 0.36, p < 0.01), and no significant effect of R-s on LAI were found. Conversely, the path analysis indicated that R-s and P were the largest decision coefficients affecting the monthly LAI of alfalfa and S. bungeana, respectively, due to the different time-to-peak LAI and root growth depth of these two grass species. This study can provide theoretical support for ecological restoration and system management of semiarid grasslands.

Aeolian sandy soils cover >90% of the sandy area of the Mu Us Sandy Land (MUSL) in Northwest China. These soils have low water- and nutrient-retention capacity, limiting their ability to support plant growth. Pisha sandstone, a type of loose rock widely distributed in the MUSL, is regarded as an environmental hazard because it easily weathers, resulting in severe soil erosion and water loss. However, the retention capacity of the aeolian sandy soil can be significantly improved through blending with Pisha sandstone. We investigated the impacts of water supply (35% and 70% of soil water-holding capacity) and P supply (0, 5 and 20 mg P kg(-1) soil) on plant growth and P and nitrogen (N) nutrition by growing lucerne (Medicago saliva L.) in MUSL aeolian sandy soil amended or not with Pisha sandstone. Soil type and P supply had greater effects than water supply on lucerne growth and on P and N nutrition. Biomass accumulation and shoot P and N concentrations were increased by amending the aeolian sandy soil with Pisha sandstone and increasing P supply. The N : P ratios in shoots indicated that plant growth was limited by P but not by N. Aeolian sandy soil amended with Pisha sandstone and supplied with P at 5 mg kg -I enhanced lucerne growth; this practice is feasible for pasture development in the MUSL.

In this study, we collected suspended sediment samples at the hydrological stations to identify the sediment source dynamics during flood events in a highly erodible basin, the Huangfu River basin in the Northern Loess Plateau. A total of 6 flood events were sampled during 2016 and 2018 for investigation, the flow discharge was featured by a rapid rising limb and a slow falling limb. Compared with the sediment sources, the silt fraction in the suspended sediments was enriched and the sand fraction in the suspended sediment was depleted. The dominant particle grain size of suspended sediments was coarse sand (56.89%), higher than silt (41.81%) and clay (1.3%). The sediment sources were estimated using the FingerPro unmixing model based on the conservativeness index (CI) and consensus ranking (CR) methods. The results of the unmixing model reveal that the bare land was the predominant source of suspended sediments, ranging from 40% to 57%, which was much higher than farmland (27 similar to 31%) and grassland (16 similar to 25%). Our findings imply that the bare land (weathered sandstone area) is the critical region for soil loss control in the Huangfu River basin. A combination of vegetation restoration measures and engineering measures are proposed to improve the sustainable development of ecological environment in the basin.

Object-oriented classification technique was applied on high resolution remote sensing data (LISS-IV/ spatial resolution- 5.8 m) for mapping agroforestry/ poplar area in six study districts. Total agroforestry area in six districts was estimated to be 91622.73 ha. Poplar area was found to be the highest in Bijnor district (12840.53 ha) of Uttar Pradesh followed by Haridwar district (8096.25) of Uttarakhand. As % of agroforestry area in district, Haridwar has the highest poplar area (61.2%). Estimated stem, aboveground and total biomass of poplar plantations were found to be the highest in Baghpat district because of high tree density. Muzaffarnagar district has second the highest values of estimated stem, aboveground and total biomass (128.55, 153.89 and 194.80 t ha(-1), respectively). Carbon stock was also found to be the highest in Bijnor district (0.909 million tonnes) followed by Muzaffarnagar district (0.813 million tonnes). About 2.795 million tonnes of C-stock in total biomass was assessed in five selected districts of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. In this way, contribution of these districts in atmospheric CO2 absorption was to the tune of 10.257 million tonnes in total biomass of poplar plantations. It was concluded that agroforestry systems in general and poplar based systems in particular have significant contribution in reduction of atmospheric CO2. Hence, they would certainly play an important role in climate change mitigation at state/ regional level.																			0971-2070					DEC	2022	43	2					263	268																WOS:000971145500008

The weed attacks most cultivated cereals and legumes with crop losses as high as 100% when no control measure is employed. Studies conducted in the dry savannas of Nigeria indicated that Striga seedbank is strongly related to soil and climate properties. This study was conducted to model Striga hermonthica seedbank zones in the dry savannas of Nigeria based on soil and climate properties of the areas. Using multi-stage spatial sampling, 169 soil samples were collected at the centroids of 25 x 25 km grids across the study area and analysed for physico-chemical properties. The number of Striga seeds were counted from the soil samples using water elutriator and potassium bicarbonate method. Daily temperature, relative humidity and rainfall for each point were downloaded from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). Minimum and maximum temperatures, and relative humidity were accessed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA POWER). Thresholds of various soil and climate variables for optimum concentration of Striga seedbank were analysed using boundary line analysis (BLA). From the BLA, optimum amount of rainfall for high Striga seedbank was 549 mm per annum. While temperature has a wide suitability range for Striga seedbank development. Principal component analysis was used to reduce dimensionality of the dataset into principal components (PCs). Seven PCs which explained 75.6% variation in the data were retained and used in the weighed overlay modelling (WOM). The weighted overlay map produced five distinct Striga seedbank zones; very low, low, moderate, high and very high. More than 60% of the study area had moderate to high Striga seedbanks. The zones vary mostly based on soil, climate and Striga seed count. The establishment of the optimum levels of the environmental factors at which Striga seedbank is favoured will assist in designing a more site-specific Striga management. However, for scalability purpose, adoption of the Striga zoning approach can be useful.

Plant roots have significant effects on the soil detachment rate (SDR). Current studies have mainly focused on root effects on the SDR under single species. Because it is difficult to identify the roots of different species in mixed-plant areas, few studies have evaluated the root effects on the SDR under mixed -plants. Natural, undisturbed soil samples containing roots were collected from four natural sampling plots with single plant types, and six natural sampling plots with mixed plant types. Bare soil was used as the control. The samples were subjected to flow scouring through indoor hydraulic flume experiments under six shear stresses (3.65, 7.28, 7.67, 8.59, 10.15, and 12.19 Pa). The results showed that the root reduction effect on the SDR under the mode of tap roots mixed with fibrous roots was 55.54 % weaker than that the mode of fibrous roots mixed with other fibrous roots. When fi-brous roots were mixed with tap roots, the fibrous roots indirectly affected the SDR through soil mechanical properties, while the indirect path of the tap roots on the SDR was not unique. However, the indirect effect of roots on the SDR was weaker than the direct effect. The mixed roots affected the SDR mainly by rill erodibility, not critical shear stress. The variation in rill erodibility at the mixed root sites was similar to the SDR variation at those sites. The mode of grasses with fibrous roots mixed with other grasses with fibrous roots was considered as better for soil and water vegetation conservation.

The Co-doped ZnO photocatalyst was first prepared through a simple wet impregnation method and subsequently characterized using various qualitative and quantitative techniques. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed for experimental design and optimization of photocatalytic process. The effects including initial concentration of 4- Nitrophenol [4-NP](in), catalyst dosage, pH and irradiation time were investigated, and RSM suggested a second-degree polynomial model for abatement of p-nitrophenol from aqueous phase. Under optimized conditions (pH = 5; Irradiation time = 180 min; catalyst dosage = 30 mg; [4-NP](in) = 30 mg/L), up to 82% degradation was achieved, signifying the efficacy of the prepared photocatalyst. Moreover, the real case study was employed by incorporating Co-doped ZnO nanocomposite for treatment of real paper wastewater and results showed a considerable photocatalytic activity of Co-ZnO nanocomposites on paper wastewater.

The main goal of this study is to integrate envirotyping techniques and multi-trait selection for mean performance and the stability of maize genotypes growing in the Huanghuaihai plain in China. A panel of 26 maize hybrids growing in 10 locations in two crop seasons was evaluated for 9 traits. Considering 20 years of climate information and 19 environmental covariables, we identified four mega-environments (ME) in the Huanghuaihai plain which grouped locations that share similar long-term weather patterns. All the studied traits were significantly affected by the genotype x mega-environment x year interaction, suggesting that evaluating maize stability using single-year, multi-environment trials may provide misleading recommendations. Counterintuitively, the highest yields were not observed in the locations with higher accumulated rainfall, leading to the hypothesis that lower vapor pressure deficit, minimum temperatures, and high relative humidity are climate variables that -under no water restriction- reduce plant transpiration and consequently the yield. Utilizing the multi-trait mean performance and stability index (MTMPS) prominent hybrids with satisfactory mean performance and stability across cultivation years were identified. G23 and G25 were selected within three out of the four mega-environments, being considered the most stable and widely adapted hybrids from the panel. The G5 showed satisfactory yield and stability across contrasting years in the drier, warmer, and with higher vapor pressure deficit mega-environment, which included locations in the Hubei province. Overall, this study opens the door to a more systematic and dynamic characterization of the environment to better understand the genotype-by-environment interaction in multi-environment trials.																			1664-462X					NOV 14	2022	13								1030521	10.3389/fpls.2022.1030521	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1030521								36452111					WOS:000891101000001

We have investigated the morphological, physiological and chemical variabilities of white (Morus alba), red (Morus rubra) and black (Morus nigra) mulberry genotypes grown in four regions of Iran. Among the genotypes assessed, fresh fruit weight varied between 3.2 and 87.9 g, total chlorophyll ranged from 4.3 to 13.4 mg/g fresh weight and vitamin C content ranged from 5.5 to 64 mg per 100 g. The highest and lowest antioxidant activity was 275 and 1575 mg ascorbic acid equivalent (AAE) 100 g(-1) fresh weight, respectively. The population analysis indicated that the Gorgan population, in terms of morphological and physiological traits, and Shahrood population, in terms of chemical traits, had the highest coefficient of variation. Correlation analysis showed that fruit size and taste were positively correlated with foliar traits and that phenolic content was positively correlated with both antioxidant activity and total soluble solids (TSS). Of the indices assessed, the Berger-Parker index was the most valuable because it was able to identify significant differences between populations in terms of the studied traits. The results of this study confirm that Iran is one of the mulberry phenotypic and biochemical diversity areas and provide information of possible use for the development, conservation and selection of parents for cross-combinations in breeding programs.

INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS												Plant height is a key agronomic trait in bidirectional regulation of flax bast fiber and seeds yield. Although plant height is significantly distinct between oil flax and fiber flax, the genetic basis of plant height remains largely unknown. In this study, plant height related genes in model species Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa L.) were homologous aligned to flax genome. And combined with the reported flax plant height candidate genes, 1593 genes were considered to have potential association with plant height in flax. Subsequently, a transcriptome analysis of tall and dwarf flax cultivars revealed that 532 candidates were differentially expression in young stem tissue above snap point, which were regarded as preliminary candidate genes for plant height. Next, the population level validation was performed using a core collection containing 200 flax accessions across four environments, and 30 genes repeatedly detected at least two environments were significantly associated with plant height. Taken together, our study provides a new strategy to rapid identify candidate genes associated with agronomic traits by combining transcriptome and population level validation. Meanwhile, our results provide valuable genomic resources and molecular insight into variation of plant height in flax subgroups, and may accelerate the improvement of high yield flax based on genomics-assisted breeding.

The status of farm mechanization for different crops, farm power availability, farm machinery manufacturing and sale, standardization and testing, and Government initiatives to ensure mechanization of Indian agriculture are assessed in this study. The total farm power availability in Indian agriculture was 2.24 kW/ha in 2016-17. It had a share of 1.324, 0.018, 0.021, 0.460, 0.193, 0.091 and 0.130 kW/ha from tractors, power tillers, combine harvesters, diesel engines, electric motors, humans and draught animals, respectively. The overall mechanization levels for rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, pulses, oilseeds, cotton and sugarcane crops were 45, 63, 40, 26, 34, 34, 26 and 24%, respectively. The increasing trend in establishment of custom hiring centres and hi-tech hubs along with farm machinery banks at village level has ensured availability of modern agricultural machinery for different field operations to small and marginal farmers. The quality of farm equipment is ensured by testing involving laboratory and field performance evaluation and followed by certification at designated testing centres. There is a need to innovate custom service or a rental model by institutionalization for high cost farm machinery to reduce the cost of operation.

Water stable isotopic compositions in precipitation, soil, and four plants (xylem and leaf) in ecological and economic forests and hydrometeorological factors were continuously monitored for a year, and the water uptake by plants was determined using a Bayesian MixSIR model. The isotopic compositions of soil water and plant water in the ecological forest (Camphora camphora and Cunninghamia lanceolate) and economic forest (Castanea mollissima and Camellia pitardii) showed similar seasonal variation, and no significant difference between their mean isotopic values was found (p > 0.05). The isotopic compositions in leaf water of different plants in the two forests were controlled by xylem water isotope and meteorological factors, rather than soil moisture conditions. With decreasing soil water availability, the water sources of C. camphora, C. lanceolate, and C. pitardii changed from shallow to deep, while the water use pattern of C. mollissima was insensitive to changing soil moisture conditions. The water source overlapping between C. camphora and C. lanceolate in the ecological forest might generate water resource competition during the dry period, limiting their ecological functions. On the other hand, the water source partitioning between C. mollissima and C. pitardii in the economic forest facilitated the water resource allocation. Our study suggested that the overlapping and partitioning of hydrological niches among species in mixed forests were species-specific and provided a scientific basis for fully exploiting the ecological and economic benefits of silviculture ecosystems.					戴, 军杰/GQP-3514-2022; , 啸遥/L-5118-2019; Wang, Li/AAE-6919-2022	戴, 军杰/0000-0002-2487-084X; , 啸遥/0000-0002-5323-1844; He, Xinguang/0000-0002-7570-3224; /0000-0003-1571-0681													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUN	2023	621								129565	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129565		MAY 2023											WOS:001005108400001

Improving the irrigation facilities in these deserts is a key priority for the country. This study intended to contribute towards the development of the irrigation systems through identification and quantification of the relative implicit values smallholder farmers confer to the key characteristics of irrigation facilities. We elicited preferences with discrete choice experiments, estimated willingness to pay for these attributes using random parameters logit models, and analyzed heuristics in the choice process using a series of latent class models. Our results show that farmers have clear preferences for higher watering frequency and no interest in sharing irrigation water with downstream users. We also observed that there are distinct groups of farmers with comparable but different levels of preference. The development of irrigation facilities in the water-scarce parts of Uzbekistan would benefit from careful consideration of the preferences of the target communities and targeting of the schemes based on the broad heterogeneities within the communities. This will aid in the maintenance of irrigation systems and, as a result, increase agricultural production and productivity.

SEM-mapping, FTIR and XPS results indicated that sulfonic groups (-SO3H) were successfully grafted onto SHAC. The adsorption kinetic fitting displayed that the adsorption of NH4+-N by SHAC conformed to the pseudo-second-order kinetics and could reach equilibrium in about 100 min. The maximum adsorption of NH4+-N by SHAC was 77.24 mg/g, it was mainly contributed by electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding and pore volume sites. SHAC adsorption of NH4+-N resulted in the material SHAC-N, which desorption rate was considerably slower than that of commercially available ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) fertilizer and in accordance with the first order model. Wheat growth experiments revealed that the quality of wheat treated with SHAC-N (higher 100-grain weight and lower nitrate content) was better than that of NH4Cl fertilizer. In addition, the higher residual NH4+-N in the SHAC-N treatment soil fa-cilitated subsequent crop planting. These results indicated that SHAC has excellent adsorption and slow release of NH4+-N, and has great potential application for N management in environment and agriculture.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				APR 1	2023	867								161591	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161591	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161591		JAN 2023						36640881					WOS:000922672200001
J	Kidron, GJ; Kronenfeld, R; Xiao, B				Kidron, Giora J.; Kronenfeld, Rafael; Xiao, Bo			Why dew and fog measurements carried out by microlysimeters do not adequately reflect the intact soil? The role of temperature	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												The assumption that microlysimeters (MLs) adequately reflect the soil conditions is widespread. Nevertheless, previous findings raised doubts regarding the reliability of MLs to adequately reflect the amounts of dew and fog of the intact soil (control, COT). We therefore hypothesized that the structure (whether a single cylinder inserted into the soil (ML-I), or a cylinder inserted within a large-diameter cylinder thus mimicking a weighing ML (MLII)), the construction material (PVC and metal, i.e., iron), length (12, 50 cm) and height above ground (12, 30 cm), all will largely affect the thermal regime of the ML. A set of experiments were conducted during which the ML temperatures (1, 5 cm and more) and the dew and fog (using cloths attached to 10 x 10 x 0.2 glass plates located on the MLs) were measured. The findings indicate that (a) in comparison to COT, the minimum temperatures substantially decreased (by 2.0-2.5 degrees C) and dew and fog substantially increased (by a factor of 3.2-3.5) with height above ground (b) MLPVC-I and both types of MLs-II yielded higher dew and fog than COT, especially MLPVC-II, which yielded 2.1-fold higher amounts of dew and fog than COT (c) except for MLmetal-I that yielded similar temperatures and dew and fog to COT, all the remaining MLs exhibited lower nocturnal temperatures and higher dew and fog than COT. The higher amounts of dew and fog recorded by the MLs are explained by changes in the heat regime induced by the structure of the ML. The findings raise doubts on recent attempts to deduce the magnitude of vapor flux (dewrise, distillation) based on dew and fog measurements with MLs, and call for extra caution once arid ecosystem productivity is analyzed and predicted following ML-based dew and fog values.

The present work explored the potential formation of center dot OH during the interactions between iron-containing clay minerals and environmentally prevalent organic acids in dark environments. The results demonstrated that the accumulative center dot OH concentrations were related to the solution pH, the types of clay minerals, and the nature of organic acid species. At pH 5.5, 1.2- 15.2 times of center dot OH were generated from the reduction of Na-nontronite-2 (Na-NAu-2) compared with other day minerals in the presence of ascorbic acid (M) at 144 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ()CPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (MR) analyses indicated that Fe(III) was reduced to Fe(II) by AA during center dot OH formation. Meanwhile, chemical probe tests coupled with quenching experiments confirmed the generation of H2O2 and superoxide radical (O-2 center dot(-)), which participated in the formation of center dot OH. The produced center dot OH/O-2 center dot(-) can transform 68.4%, 86.4%, and 50.1% of phenol, p-nitrophenol, and 2.4-dichlorophenol within 168 h in AA-Na-NAu-2 suspension, respectively. This work provides valuable insights into center dot OH production in the mutual interaction between organic acids and iron-bearing clays, which is helpful for the development of a new method for removing organic pollutants from contaminated water and soil environments.

In this study, using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index dataset from 1982 to 2015, we extracted start date of vegetation growing season (SOS), end date of vegetation growing season (EOS), and length of vegetation growing season (LOS) in the middle and eastern Eurasia region and evaluated linear trends in SOS, EOS, and LOS for the entire study area, as well as for four climatic zones. The results show that the LOS has significantly increased by 0.27 days/year, mostly due to a significantly advanced SOS (-0.20 days/year) and a slightly delayed EOS (0.07 days/year) over the entire study area from 1982 to 2015. The vegetation phenology trends in the four climatic zones are not continuous throughout the 34-year period. Furthermore, discrepancies in the shifting patterns of vegetation phenology trend existed among different climatic zones. Turning points (TP) of SOS trends in the Cold zone, Temperate zone, and Tibetan Plateau zone occurred in the mid- or late 1990s. The advanced trends of SOS in the Cold zone, Temperate zone, and Tibetan Plateau zone exhibited accelerated, stalled, and reversed patterns after the corresponding TP, respectively. The TP did not occurred in Cold-Temperate zone, where the SOS showed a consistent and continuous advance. TPs of EOS trends in the Cold zone, Cold-Temperate zone, Temperate zone, and Tibetan Plateau zone occurred in the late 1980s or mid-1990s. The EOS in the Cold zone, Cold-Temperate zone, Temperate zone, and Tibetan Plateau zone showed weak advanced or delayed trends after the corresponding TP, which were comparable with the delayed trends before the corresponding TP. The shift patterns of LOS trends were primarily influenced by the shift patterns of SOS trends and were also heterogeneous within climatic zones.

Current studies have mainly focused on the quantification of the soil detachment rate (SDR). However, few studies have been conducted to explore the variation in the SDR and root effects during the soil detachment process. In this study, undisturbed soil samples were collected from four shrublands (with the main species Caragana korshinskii, C. korshinskii mixed with Agropyron cristatum, C. korshinskii mixed with Bothriochloa ischaemum, and C. korshinskii mixed with Artemisia gmelinii) and three grasslands (with the main species B. ischaemum, B. ischaemum mixed with A. cristatum, and B. ischaemum mixed with A. gmelinii) on the Loess Plateau, China. The samples were subjected to flow scouring through hydraulic flume experiments under six different shear stresses. The duration of this experiment was 6 min, and the SDR of each minute was estimated. The results showed that the SDR of shrubland was higher than that of grassland in each detachment process. The dominant factors affecting SDR gradually changed from the root-soil composite properties to the hydrodynamic parameters in this process. The effect of roots on the SDR was stronger than that of soil properties in the root-soil composite. In the early detachment stage, the 0-2 mm fine roots had the strongest effect on the SDR, while it was affected by the combined effect of fine roots and coarse roots in the later stage. When the fibrous roots were mixed with the tap roots, the fibrous roots had a significant negative effect on the SDR and mainly affected the early detachment stage. However, the tap roots had a weak effect in all stages. With the detachment process, the soil erosion resistance first increased and then stabilized, and the variations were mainly concentrated from 0 to 3 min. The roots mainly affected the SDR and soil erosion resistance by influencing rill erodibility parameters.

J	Bruins, HJ; Jongmans, T; van der Plicht, J				Bruins, Hendrik J.; Jongmans, Toine; van der Plicht, Johannes			Ancient runoff farming and soil aggradation in terraced wadi fields (Negev, Israel): Obliteration of sedimentary strata by ants, scorpions and humans	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Ancient terraced fields in ephemeral stream valleys in the Negev desert enabled farming based on runoff water from local rainfall. The runoff was captured by stone terrace walls, which were built across suitable wadis in various archaeological periods. Runoff floods added not only water to the fields but also fine sediment. However, alluvial stratification is usually absent in such terraced wadi fields. Why? We addressed this question at the rural archaeological site of Horvat Haluqim in the central Negev highlands. Our geoarchaeological excavations in Area 3 of Terraced Field 12 revealed the existence of laminar alluvial stratification, but only in the upper 5 cm. Micromorphology showed a gradual decline in the preservation of laminae with depth. Radiocarbon dating showed that the upper 50 cm of the terrace soil accumulated during the past 1300 years. Therefore, the average aggradation rate seems about 0.4 mm/year, similar to modern sedimentation measurements. We found evidence for bioturbation, particularly by ants and scorpions, in the terraced wadi fields at Horvat Haluqim. Scorpions evict the soil crumbs, excavated from the subsoil, on one side of the crescent -shaped entrance to their burrows. Ants, on the other hand, place the excavated soil crumbs all around the entrance to their underground nest. Besides bioturbation, human soil disturbance by farming is far more destructive to alluvial stratification. Hoeing and ploughing (tillage) can erase alluvial laminae from the surface to a depth of about 10 cm in one farming season. Clear evidence of ancient farming activities in Area 3 was found in darker soil layers from a depth of 45 cm-92 cm. Laminar alluvial strata have not survived in these layers. Micromorphology revealed fine charcoal, bone and pottery fragments, interpreted as kitchen/household refuse added as fertilizer to the aggrading soil surface. In addition, non -burned dung fragments and non -charred spherulites were found, indicating also the use of animal dung as manure. Darker soil layers have a lower bulk density and a high porosity with an extremely large amount of fine pores, probably ancient root channels of barley or wheat. Though runoff flows kept adding laminated alluvial layers to the aggrading terraced wadi fields, the fine laminae ( initial facies ) did not endure the tooth of time. They were gradually obliterated by bioturbation and/or rapidly erased by human farming ac- tivities (tillage and manuring), so that laminae are non-existent in the ultimate facies of the aggrading sediment - soil in agricultural terraced wadi fields.																			1040-6182	1873-4553				APR 20	2020	545				SI		87	101		10.1016/j.quaint.2019.11.027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.11.027													WOS:000542927400009

Landscapes of the Lake Eyre Basin: the catchment-scale context that creates fluvial diversity	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												Lake Eyre Basin (LEB) rivers are important but under-researched. This study integrates published and new information into a systematic geomorphological overview, subdividing the LEB into nine landscape zones: basin-margin Uplands with relatively high-energy rivers; Rocky Fringe, piedmont with short rivers and floodouts; Western Rivers, notable for neotectonism and stream capture; low-relief Northern Plains drainages and floodouts; Central Plains dunefield; Channel Country-Vertic Downs, cracking-clay interfluves and valley macrochannels; Channel Country-Stony Domes, rocky or sandy interfluves and complex macrochannels; Lakes & Dunes maintained by saline groundwater; and playas in the Mega-lakes. Zone boundary GIS datasets are available. LEB rivers are shown to be diverse and distinctive, indicating a need for locally relevant knowledge in management and monitoring. Fluvial landform suites include sand-bed rivers, macrochannels hosting coexisting anabranching and anastomosing systems in vertic floodplains, floodouts, low-angle alluvial fans, and three types of waterhole. Channels may be discontinuous or not present; floodplains can dominate flow transmission. Contributing hillslopes are heterogenous in their capacity to generate runoff, while drainage networks may have low to high degrees of integration. Management implications include the importance of in-river terrestrial ecosystems and "patchy" drainage networks, and the inapplicability of some morphometric practices.																			0372-1426	2204-0293				JAN 2	2022	146	1					109	167		10.1080/03721426.2021.2003514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03721426.2021.2003514		FEB 2022											WOS:000750749100001

Here, we established machine learning models to predict the GHG emissions from Chinese paddy systems using a dataset including 782 CH4 and 679 N2O emission observations based on 118 published studies across China. Our results identified XGBoost was the most suitable model with the outstanding efficiency and accuracy for predicting both CH4 (R2 = 0.754, RMSE = 0.485 kg ha-1) and N2O emissions (R2 = 0.762, RMSE = 0.423 kg ha-1) from rice fields in China. We found mineral and organic fertilizer rate, irrigation mode, straw returned proportion and tillage depth were key factors in regulating GHG emissions. Specifically, CH4 emissions trended to increase first and then decrease with increasing mineral nitrogen fertilizer rate, with the inflection point delayed under the application of organic fertilizer. On the other hand, N2O emissions continued to increase until the N fertilizer rate reached approximately 150 kg ha-1. The use of organic fertilizer, tillage, straw return in half and full quantity increased global warming potential (GWP) by 80.3 %, 33.8 %, 25.2 % and 111.6 %, respectively. Frequent drainage (FD) was identified as the most promising water management mode, with a higher potential for GHG emission mitigation of 39.5 % compared to continuous flooding, followed by mid-season drainage at 18.4 %. We found the combination of a mineral nitrogen fertilizer rate of 128 kg ha-1, FD water management, without straw, tillage, and organic fertilizer could achieve the most effective GHG emission mitigation, with a GWP of 3.13 Mg CO2 equivalent ha-1. Our findings provided a new insight for predicting GHG emissions from rice fields on a large scale, and offered guidance for mitigating GHG emissions from rice production in China.																			0168-1699	1872-7107				JUL	2023	210								107929	10.1016/j.compag.2023.107929	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2023.107929		MAY 2023											WOS:001007203200001

This study aimed to clarify the change law of EA and ES in soil with different nitrogen addition levels under plastic film mulching, and to optimize the application amount of nitrogen fertilizer that was used. Based on the location experiment of plastic film mulching fertilization that has been ongoing since 2015, soil samples were collected from different depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm) during the harvest period of spring maize in October 2021. Four soil extracellular enzyme activities (beta-1,4 glucosidase (beta G), beta-1, 4-N-acetylglucosidase (NAG), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP)) involved in soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling at different nitrogen application levels (0, 90, 150, 225 and 300 kg center dot hm(-2)) were studied under two planting patterns of no plastic film mulching (LD) and plastic film mulching (PM). The latest discovery of this study is that the activities of soil EA involved in the cycling of soil carbon C, N and P are similar in different soil depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm). Both EC: P and EC: P in the soil in this area are less than 1:1, indicating that the soil is limited by N and P. Comprehensive analysis showed that a nitrogen application level of 225 kg center dot hm(-2) was beneficial to the balance of soil nutrients and the improvement of soil EA at harvest. At the same time, PM can effectively improve the soil EA and is more conducive to the balance of soil nutrients. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that EA and ES were strongly correlated with pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Most importantly, this study revealed that the activity of extracellular enzymes in arid and semi-arid areas was constantly self-regulated with the addition of nitrogen, which provided theoretical and technical support for the efficient use of nitrogen under the condition of plastic film mulching.					zhang, luyu/JJC-4227-2023															2077-0472				APR 25	2023	13	5							938	10.3390/agriculture13050938	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13050938													WOS:000994239300001

Future scenarios of rice brown plant hopper <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> (Stal.) under changing climate	JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY												Abundance of brown plant hopper (BPH) Nilaparvatalugens (Stal) (Delphacidae: Homoptera) is modulated by prevalent weather conditions of rice growing seasons and locations. Categorization of BPH adults caught in light traps (nos/week/trap) into low, moderate and high and formulation of criteria accounting weather variables [maximum/ minimum/ mean temperature (UC), morning/evening/mean relative humidity (%), rainfall (mm) and sunshine hours (h/day) and wind speed (km/h)] during kharif of 2011-16 for four locations viz., Ludhiana (Punjab), Chinsurah (West Bengal), Raipur (Chhattisgarh) and Aduthurai (Tamil Nadu) with associated rules for weather based BPH prediction. Validation of BPH predictions for kharif 2017 indicated 96, 87, 73 and 61% accuracies in respect of Aduthurai (TN), Raipur (CG), Ludhiana (PB) and Chinsurah (WB). Future weather based predictions of BPH based on climatic projections of representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 for 2020, 2050 and 2080 indicated absence of high population at Chinsurah (WB) during all time periods of 2020-2080. Progressively reducing BPH abundance from past (2011) to all future periods was noticed at Aduthurai (TN). 'High' BPH from 2020 and beyond over 2011 and 2016 at Raipur (CG) and reducing 'high' but increasing 'moderate' category between 2020-2050 but the reverse in 2080 at Ludhiana (PB) were predicted indicating requirement of continued monitoring strategies put in place at these locations.

Farmer's share in consumer's rupee is about 25% in carrot and 41% in tomato. The marketing efficiency index in prominent channels of 0.33 in carrot and 0.71 in tomato is quite low. The most common and important constraint is the non-adherence of traders with the prescribed auction system leading to lower price realisation to the farmers, followed by excessive deductions from value realised.

However, the mechanisms underlying community assemblages and promoting temporal succession are often overlooked in microbial ecology, and comparisons of the relative roles of bacteria and fungi during long-term secondary succession are rare. Using both 16S and ITS rRNA gene sequencing, we studied shifts in bacterial and fungal communities in a well-established secondary successional chronosequence that spanned approximately 160 years in an ecosystem. Our results showed that the abundance of both bacteria and fungi increased with succession in the early stages but then reached a relatively stable state in later successional stages. Diversity showed a fairly linear increase with succession, and there were inconsistent changes between the bacterial and fungal communities. During succession, soil bulk density, soluble carbon, total nitrogen and plant richness had large effects on the microbial community. The abundance of most phyla showed parabolic trends with succession; however, Verrucomicrobia and Basidiomycota showed linear increases with succession, and Cercozoa and Chytridiomycota showed linear decreases with succession. These microbial taxa may be considered collaborative development microbial biomarkers of secondary succession. The predicted microbial functions related to C and N cycle genes showed corresponding changes in succession, which need further study. Our findings suggest that the relationships between soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities mutually influence one another, leading to their ongoing relationship in the course of secondary succession.					贾, 晓宇/AHB-0724-2022	贾, 晓宇/0000-0001-6011-1472; zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310													1085-3278	1099-145X				MAY 30	2020	31	9					1151	1166		10.1002/ldr.3505	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3505		JAN 2020											WOS:000509451900001
J	Ma, JY; Li, ZB; Sun, BY; Ma, B				Ma, Jianye; Li, Zhanbin; Sun, Baoyang; Ma, Bo			Mechanism and modeling of different plant root effects on soil detachment rate	CATENA												Plant roots significantly affect soil erosion, although the mechanism of how roots affect the soil detachment rate (SDR) by overland flow on the Loess Plateau is not fully understood. This study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of how roots affect SDR using natural undisturbed soil samples taken from five sampling plots with the dominant species of Agropyron cristatum, Caragana korshinskii, Medicago sativa, Caragana korshinskii, and Robinia pseudoacacia. Bare land was used as the control plot. The samples were subjected to flow scouring through hydraulic flume experiments under six different shear stresses. The results showed that the roots could significantly reduce the SDR by > 83.48% compared with the bare soil. The herbs with fibrous roots (A. cristatum) had a strong root-reducing effect on the SDR. Due to the weaker root-reducing effect of herbs with taproots, the comprehensive reducing effect of herb roots was lower than that of shrubs (C. korshinskii). Because of the higher soil organic matter, the tree roots (R. pseudoacacia) still had a higher reduction effect on the SDR even with a smaller root content, and its SDR was between that of herbs and shrubs. The SDR could be divided into 3 zones based on root mass density (RMD): zone I (SDR is sensitive to root action), zone II (the effect of soil properties on SDR is prominent), and zone III (SDR is relatively stable). The critical conditions between different zones and the main controlling factors affecting the SDR in different zones were analyzed. The prediction accuracy of the SDR model could be improved by constructing the model using the zoning method (NSE > 0.95). A prediction model of SDR suitable for root-soil complexes of different plant species was developed (NSE = 0.90).

In this study, we investigated an in situ manipulative experiment with four levels of water exposure (ambient precipitation +0%, +25%, +50%, and +100% of local annual mean precipitation) in a desert ecosystem of China. After 9 years of water addition, Illumina sequencing was used to analyze taxonomic compositions of the soil bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities. The results showed significant increases in microbial biomass carbon (MBC) at higher amended precipitation levels, with the highest values reported at 100% precipitation. Furthermore, an increase in the bacterial species richness was observed along the water addition gradient. In addition, the relative abundance of several bacterial phyla, such as Proteobacteria, significantly increased, whereas that of some drought-tolerant taxa, including Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes, decreased. In addition, the phyla Planctomycetes and Nitrospirae, associated with nitrification, positively responded to increased precipitation. Archaeal diversity significantly reduced under 100% treatment, with changes in the relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota being the main contributors to shifts in the archaeal community. The fungal community composition was stable in response to water addition. Results from the Mantel test and structural equation models suggested that bacterial and archaeal communities reacted contrastingly to water addition. Bacterial community composition was directly affected by changing soil moisture and temperature, while archaeal community composition was indirectly affected by changing nitrogen availability. These findings highlight the importance of soil moisture and nitrogen in driving microbial responses to long-term precipitation changes in the desert ecosystem.

Allan; Kam, Michael; Koren, Lee			Free-living gerbils with higher testosterone take fewer risks	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR												Among the physiological differences between the sexes are circulating androgen levels. Testosterone (T) is an androgen that has been linked to aggression and risk-taking in male vertebrates, so that males with higher T are generally more aggressive and take more risks. In females, T is not often measured, and its relationship with behaviour has been less studied. The costs of elevated T are assumed to be higher for reproductive females, while the benefits higher for males. Here, we tested the association between endogenous T and risk-taking behaviours in both males and females under well-studied experimental settings in free-living Baluchistan gerbils (Gerbillus nanus; Gn). In addition, we experimentally elevated Gn T levels using implants and measured risk-taking behaviour. Surprisingly, we found that there were no differences in the association between T and risk-taking behaviours between males and females, and that in both sexes, Gn with higher T levels took fewer risks. We also found that Gn spent equal time foraging between risky (open habitat) and safe (under a bush) experimental food patches. We expected Gn, which are nocturnal, to take fewer risks during full moon nights, but found that Gn were more active during moon lit nights than during dark (new moon) nights. This study demonstrates that T has many functions, and that its effects are complex and often unpredictable. It also shows that hypotheses regarding the propensity to take risks under specific coverage and light regimes are not universal, and likely include variables such as species, environment, context, and predator-specific behavioural strategies.																			0031-9384	1873-507X				OCT 1	2023	269								114277	10.1016/j.physbeh.2023.114277	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2023.114277		JUN 2023						37352905					WOS:001039048000001

Each of these functions could affect a plant's ability to tolerate the biotic and abiotic stresses encountered in different parts of the world. However, we know remarkably little about large scale biogeographic patterns in leaf pubescence. Our aims were: (a) to determine whether a higher proportion of species have pubescence at sites where it is hot, dry and solar radiation is high, and (b) to quantify the latitudinal gradient in pubescence. Location Australia. Taxon Vascular land plants. Methods We compiled data on the presence/absence of pubescence on mature photosynthetic organs for 4,183 species, spanning 107 families. We combined these data with over 1.9 million species occurrence records from the Atlas of Living Australia to calculate the proportion of species with pubescence in 3,261 grid cells spanning the Australian continent. Results The proportion of pubescent species was most closely related to solar radiation (R-2 = 0.33), followed by maximum temperature in the warmest month (R-2 = 0.30). Mean annual precipitation was very weakly related to pubescence (R-2 = 0.01). We found a significant negative relationship between latitude and pubescence (R-2 = 0.19), with the average percentage of species with pubescence dropping from 46% at 10 degrees S to 35% at 44 degrees S. This cross-species relationship remained significant after accounting for phylogenetic relationships between species. We found that a quadratic model explained more variation in pubescence across latitudes than did a linear model. The quadratic model shows a peak in the proportion of pubescent species at 19 degrees S (within the tropics). Main conclusions Our findings are consistent with the idea that leaf pubescence may have a protective function in areas with high solar radiation and high temperatures. Our data are also consistent with the idea that species towards the tropics should be better defended than are species at higher latitudes.

Ridge-furrow plastic film mulching (RFPM) is a widely used micro-catchment planting system in the rain-fed farming area of the Loess Plateau in China, there are still problems of excessive N fertilizer application and unreasonable application method under this system. In this study, we conducted a two-year field experiment with traditional flat planting (FP) as a control, to determine the effect of N application rate (180 kg ha-1, 240 kg ha-1, and 300 kg ha-1) on soil nitrate N, total N, grain yield and N fertilizer partial factor productivity (NFPF) of spring maize under RFPM with three ridge-furrow ratios (RF40-70 = 40 cm:70 cm; RF55-55 = 55 cm:55 cm; RF70-40 = 70 cm:40 cm). In addition, under N application rate of 240 kg ha-1, a micro-plot experiment was conducted to determine the fate of fertilizer N by applying N15-labeled urea on ridges and in furrows under RFPM, respectively. The results showed that compared with flat planting (FP), RFPM reduced the residue of NO3-- N (0-200 cm soil layer) and accumulation total N (0-100 cm soil layer) in the soil under three N application rates, especially under RF70-40. Reducing the N application rate decreased the accumulation of NO3--N and total N under each ridge-furrow ratio. Compared with FP, RFPM increased the N accumulation, grain yield, NFPF for spring maize under all three N application rates. However, the N harvest index decreased as the N application rate increased under RFPM, thereby suggesting that the targeted N production could be improved for plants by optimizing the N application rate. By balancing the grain yield and NFPF, the optimal N application rates under FP, RF40-70, RF55-55, and RF70-40 were determined as 223 kg ha-1, 204 kg ha-1, 228 kg ha-1, and 207 kg ha-1, respectively, and these results also suggest that RFPM can lower the N input threshold compared with FP. In addition, N isotope tracing was used to clarify the fate of fertilizer N under RFPM, which showed that the contribution of fertilizer N to plants increased when N fertilizer was applied in furrows, and reduced the residual proportion of fertilizer N in soil. Therefore, our findings suggest that N fertilizer should be applied in the furrows after forming the ridges and furrows under RFPM.					li, yan/ITU-9719-2023; li, qing/JEF-9044-2023; Yan, Miaochen/JLL-5061-2023; li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023; cheng, chen/JHS-9462-2023; li, wl/JJC-0768-2023; Zhang, Han/JMR-0670-2023; li, jing/JEF-8436-2023; liu, bing/JJD-5566-2023; li, jiaxin/JNT-5073-2023; zhang, ly/JMB-7214-2023; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023; 王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023; Li, Jiawei/JOJ-9277-2023; .., What/IXW-6776-2023; Zhao, Yi/JFA-7988-2023; liu, xy/JEP-3175-2023; Yang, Jie/JDM-6213-2023; zhang, xiang/JJD-7003-2023; liu, xinyu/IWD-6630-2023; li, yurong/JMQ-8540-2023; liu, lin/JFK-3401-2023; wang, zhiwen/JDV-9990-2023; wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; Wang, Guang/JFS-8374-2023; cheng, cheng/JBR-8359-2023; WANG, YANG/JFA-8821-2023; xu, chen/JNE-5010-2023; Yang, Fei/JLM-3367-2023; zhang, xiao/JCN-8822-2023; Wang, Yuchen/JPW-9345-2023; zhou, yang/JED-3951-2023; chen, chen/JGD-3057-2023; Liu, Yuan/JFB-4766-2023; liu, lingling/IUQ-7478-2023; yang, yun/IZE-1092-2023; yang, li/JGM-1009-2023; WANG, HUI/JFA-9683-2023; Chen, Xin/JDN-2017-2023; Liu, Yixuan/JFJ-2820-2023; Liu, Joanne/JRY-7564-2023; sun, chen/JCP-0396-2023; ZHOU, YUE/IZE-6277-2023; 李, 嘉馨/IWM-4023-2023	Yang, Jie/0000-0002-3941-0053; 													0167-1987	1879-3444				MAY	2023	229								105680	10.1016/j.still.2023.105680	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2023.105680		FEB 2023											WOS:000941693800001
J	Liao, ZM; Liu, X; van Dijk, A; Yue, C; He, BB				Liao, Zhanmang; Liu, Xia; van Dijk, Albert; Yue, Chao; He, Binbin			Continuous woody vegetation biomass estimation based on temporal modeling of Landsat data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Optical data records have been widely used for monitoring forest aboveground biomass (AGB) dynamics given their freely available long-term archives and high temporal and spatial resolution. However, most of the methods utilized only the spatial information of reflectance (e.g. annual mean reflectance) to estimate AGB, lack of consideration for dynamic characteristics of reflectance. These methods are susceptible to reflectance saturation and temporal noise and may cause uncertainties in their estimation. In this study, we exploited dynamic time-series information of reflectance to enhance the accuracy and robustness of AGB estimation. More specifically, we utilized the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) algorithm for temporal modeling of Landsat reflectance, followed by estimation of forest AGB with a random forest (RF) algorithm using the temporal information extracted by the CCDC model as input. The AGB estimation method was developed using in situ AGB measurements in Australia (10304 plots, range: [0.05, 936] tons/ha, mean: 153 tons/ha) and Landsat 5/7/8 data. Plot-scale results show that the overall reflectance derived by the CCDC model outperformed the annual mean reflectance when used in RF to estimate AGB because the overall reflectance is more robust to noisy or missing data. Introducing the CCDC model parameters into the RF model further improved estimation accuracy. The use of overall reflectance plus temporal parameters in AGB estimation increased R-2 to 0.60 and reduced RMSE to 72.9 tons/ha, compared to using annual mean reflectance (R-2 of 0.45 and RMSE of 85.7 tons/ha). This improvement may be attributed to CCDC model better capturing temporal changes in reflectance as the solar angle changes between seasons. Those changes relate to forest canopy coverage, width, and height, which are linked to AGB. Regional analysis for a 19,000-km(2) area in Western Australia showed that this approach could characterize different types of forest AGB change over a 30 years period (1990-2019), including both gradual and sudden AGB losses and gains from, e.g., forest disturbance and management activities. This AGB estimation method has the potential to mitigate noisy or missing data and could be applied to large-scale forest biomass monitoring using the rich Landsat data archive.																			1569-8432	1872-826X				JUN	2022	110								102811	10.1016/j.jag.2022.102811	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.102811		MAY 2022											WOS:000832703000003

This land conversion could reduce the pools of C, N and P that are stored in the soil. Consequently, the assessment of the impact of land cultivation or fencing on soil nutrients and properties could improve sustainable grassland management. This study compared soil nutrients and properties of four land use types in a subalpine meadow: (1) natural pasture grazed traditionally by domestic yak and sheep; (2) fenced natural pasture which excluded grazing livestock; (3) land cultivated for oat fodder (oat land); and (4) land cultivated for barley grain (barley land). Soil measurements were done at three depth levels (0-10 cm; 10-20 cm; 20-30 cm) after three years of cultivation or fencing. Compared to the natural pasture, soil carbon and nitrogen parameters all decreased significantly in the barley land, were similar or increased in the fenced pasture and showed mixed but moderate changes in the oat land. Total phosphorus generally showed insignificant changes in all treatments. At the 0-10 cm soil layer, there was a gain in carbon in the fenced pasture (5.18 mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1)), a loss in carbon in the barley land (7.50 mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1)) and a slight loss in carbon in the oat land (0.88 mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1)). Thus, cultivation for barley reduced soil nutrients substantially in the subalpine meadow, particularly in the surface soil layer, while cultivation for oats resulted in moderate changes. We concluded that land cultivation for oats and soil nutrient recovery by short-term fencing after cultivation are preferred alternatives of land use than cultivation for grain barley in the subalpine meadows of the northeast Tibetan plateau.

The factors controlling the underlying pathways of the CO2 fixation by microorganisms living in soils remain unclear. Here, almost all genes responsible for the eight CO2 fixation pathways in semiarid soil CFMs communities were identified using metagenomic analysis: including the reductive citrate cycle (rTCA), dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate cycle (DC/4-HB), reductive pentose phosphate cycle (Calvin), 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle (3-HP), 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB), C4dicarboxylic acid, CAM cycle, and reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (Wood-Ljungdahl pathway). By tracing the CO2 fixation flux via C-13 labeling, it was shown that the CO2 fixation rates increased along the precipitation gradient. The rTCA and 3-HP pathways for CO2 fixing microorganisms were closely associated with C-13 incorporation into the soil organic matter under high mean annual precipitation (MAP) (400-600 mm), whereas the Calvin cycle played a vital role in soils under low MAP (< 400 mm) conditions. The abundance of the key genes within the C fixing pathways showed that the microbial C accumulation in soils was mainly influenced by the MAP. In semiarid to semi-humid grassland soils, where CO2 fixation by CFMs provided about 8.1-27 mg C m(-2) day(-1) input into the ecosystem, we demonstrated that the rTCA, Calvin, and 3-HP cycle were vital to this essential pathway of C sequestration.					haohao, li/HLG-9330-2023; Dippold, Michaela A/C-1548-2017; Kuzyakov, Yakov/D-1605-2010	Kuzyakov, Yakov/0000-0002-9863-8461; Dippold, Michaela/0000-0002-3657-4693													0038-0717	1879-3428				SEP	2022	172								108764	10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108764	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2022.108764													WOS:000827333000007

Yet, it is unclear whether there is still a room for further improvement on NPP while stabilizing soil organic carbon through returning previous maize stover pieces. To address this issue, maize stubbles were smashed into pieces and in situ ploughed into 30 cm topsoil at a semi-arid site in northwest China from 2016 to 2017. This was done using the Pioneer 335 maize variety with three treatments (CK, ridge and furrow without mulching; RFM, ridge and furrow with plastic mulching; RFML, 3.49 t ha(-1) of maize stover returning in RFM; RFMH, 5.24 t ha(-1) of returning in RFM). The results indicated that maize stover returning exhibited similar trend as RFM at early cool seedling stage, raising the topsoil temperature. However, in warm and dry silking stage (2017), both stover returning rates reduced soil temperatures by 1.33 and 0.8 C-degrees relative to RFM and CK (P < 0.05), respectively. The soil water storage increased significantly in RFMH by 17.3% and RFML by 28.5% relative to that of RFM, in a warm and dry growing season (2017). Critically, stover returning increased (P < 0.05) soil organic carbon and light fraction organic carbon turnover across the two growing seasons. By improving hydrothermal conditions, stover returning in RFM increased biomass accumulation and grain yield (P < 0.05), leading to higher (P < 0.05) net economic benefit, with greater above-ground biomass NPP (74.5-93.2%) and below-ground biomass NPP (88.5-89.4%), compared with CK. In conclusion, maize stover returning of stover pieces into topsoil might be a promising solution to enhance carbon turnover for higher net primary productivity on the basis of plastic film mulching in semiarid rainfed region.

However, there are knowledge gaps on how SOC sources and stabilization respond to vegetation restoration. Therefore, we investigated lignin phenol and amino sugar biomarkers, SOC physical fractions and chemical structure in one farmland and four stands of a Robinia pseudoacacia plantation. We observed that the content of SOC increased with afforestation, but the different biomarkers had different contributions to SOC. Compared to farmland, the contribution of lignin phenols to SOC decreased in the plantations, whereas there was no difference among the four stand ages, likely resulting from the balance between increasing lignin derivation input and increasing lignin degradation. Conversely, vegetation restoration increased the content of microbial necromass carbon (MNC) and the contribution of MNC to SOC, mainly because microbial residue decomposition was inhibited by decreasing the activity of leucine aminopeptidase, while microbial necromass preservation was promoted by adjusting soil variables (soil water content, clay, pH and total nitrogen). In addition, vegetation restoration increased the particulate organic carbon (POC), mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) pools and the O-alkyl C intensify. Overall, vegetation restoration affected SOC composition by regulating lignin phenols and microbial necromass and also altered SOC stabilization by increasing the physically stable MAOC pool during late afforestation. The results of this study suggest that more attention should be given to SOC sequestration and stability during late vegetation restoration.

Echolocating bats, which crucially depend on sound for their activity, might therefore serve as bioindicators to quantify the ecological effects of sound pollution. While the influence of sound pollution on animal behaviour has been widely studied, the impact of music is almost unknown. We tested whether music, broadcast loudly, affects bats' foraging and drinking behaviour. The study was done at two waterbodies, where bats drink and forage in the Negev Desert, Israel, during summertime, when water availability is limited: both sites, one isolated natural pond and one artificial waterbody, frequently host recreational parties and concerts. We broadcast music whose frequency range did not overlap with that of bat echolocation calls, and acoustically assessed bat activity before and after the music broadcast. At the remote waterbody, used by bats as a drinking site, the number of bat passes did not vary between treatments. However, after music was broadcast, bats performed significantly more unsuccessful drinking attempts. At the artificial waterbody-a foraging site-activity decreased significantly after music was broadcast. Additionally, music had a cumulative effect on bats, since overall activity significantly decreased over the experimental period. Noise may affect bats by narrowing their attention or distracting them from their primary task. Broadcasting loud music near remote waterbodies is, therefore, significantly hazardous for bats and other wildlife.

Despite their crucial roles in biogeochemical cycles, the responses of soil bacterial communities to soil erosion and deposition remain largely unclear. In this study, a field simulation experiment was conducted to examine variation in soil bacterial communities across eroding slopes and depositional zones with three slope gradients (5 degrees, 10 degrees and 20 degrees) on the Loess Plateau of China (2015-2017). The results showed that soil physicochemical properties were altered by redistribution of runoff and sediment across eroding slopes and depositional zones. Soil bacterial alpha diversity was higher in the depositional zones of both 10 degrees and 20 degrees slopes compared with the 5 degrees reference slopes but no markedly difference was found between eroding slopes and reference slopes. By contrast, bacterial community structure differed between eroding slopes and reference slopes but not between depositional zones and reference slopes. Differentiation of bacterial communities between eroding slopes and depositional zones increased with increasing slope gradients. The bacterial network was greater and more complex within depositional zone than eroding slope, indicating more extensive bacterial interactions and greater community stability potential. Erosion- and deposition-induced redistribution of soil moisture, soil organic matter, available P, and available K were the key determinants of variation in bacterial community structure. Our findings demonstrate the contrasting effects of soil erosion and deposition on soil bacterial communities, which should be given further attention across eroding landscapes.

J	Yan, WM; Zhong, YQW; Shangguan, ZP				Yan, Weiming; Zhong, Yangquanwei; Shangguan, Zhouping			Elevated temperature exacerbates the effects of drought on the carbon and hydraulic characteristics of Robinia pseudoacacia seedlings	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												The rising temperature and extreme drought induced by climate change will considerably affect plant growth and survival. However, the interactive effects of elevated temperature and drought on carbon (C) balance and hydraulic traits remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the C exchange, hydraulic characteristics and total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) availability of different organs in Robinia pseudoacacia seedlings during drought and re-watered periods under two temperature treatments. Our study showed that drought reduced C assimilation and increased loss of plant xylem conductivity (PLC). In addition, elevated temperature exacerbated the effect of drought on the C exchange rate and hydraulic characteristics. The TNC concentrations were lower in roots than in other tissues, and seedlings exposed to drought also showed decreased TNC concentrations in specific tissues (roots, stems and leaves) and in the whole seedlings. Seedlings showed lower TNC concentrations under elevated temperature than at ambient temperature, suggesting that elevated temperature accelerated the consumption of stored TNCs. After short-term re-watered, the C exchange rate and hydraulic characteristics of drought seedlings showed larger recovery under ambient temperature than under elevated temperature. Our findings suggest that elevated temperature exacerbate the risks of hydraulic failure and C starvation in R. pseudoacacia under drought, which may increase the drought-induced seedling mortality of R. pseudoacacia in drought-prone regions under future climate scenarios.

Severe soil erosion in the Chinese Loess Plateau and the resulting high sediment yield of the Yellow River have been important research topics. Aims. Understanding the impacts of vegetation types on soil hydro-physical properties is essential for understanding regional runoff-sediment changes, soil and water conservation, and revegetation. Methods. Three main plantation covers of the study area [natural restoration grassland (NG), artificial Prunus armeniaca forest (AP), and artificial Hippophae rhamnoides shrubland (AH) with 15 years of restoration] and Sorghum bicolor agricultural land as control (CK), were selected to compare their soil hydro-physical properties and infiltration capacity in the soil profile. Key results. The bulk density was lower, and soil organic matter (SOM), the proportion of macro-aggregates (>5 mm), mean weight diameter (MWD) of water-stable aggregates, and the initial infiltration and stable infiltration rate were higher in the AH plot compared to CK and the other two plots. The impacts of vegetation restoration on soil properties were mainly in the 0-60 cm layer. Infiltration rates changed mainly within 5 h and basically stabilised within 10 h, with even shorter times to reach stable infiltration in CK. The initial and stable infiltration rates were significant positively correlated (P < 0.05) with macro-aggregate content, MWD, and SOM. Conclusions. The AH and AP had greater impacts on soil hydro-properties than NG. The AH had the greatest positive effect on soil hydro-properties and soil and water conservation functions. Implications. This study provides practical references for vegetation restoration measures assessment on the Loess Plateau or other similar regions.																			1838-675X	1838-6768				2022 JUN 28	2022										10.1071/SR21183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR21183		JUN 2022											WOS:000817173800001

Early prediction for yield loss helps to guide the timely implementation of a postfrost management strategy. Currently, frost stress indices calculated using the minimum Stevenson screen temperature (ST) only consider the effects of low temperature and duration of frost damage, exhibiting a limited ability for the early prediction of yield loss. Therefore, this study aimed to propose a new index to improve the accuracy of early prediction for yield loss. In this study, Shangqiu was selected for a survey during 2015-2019 where we proposed a method to calculate the percent yield difference (PYD) based on samples of wheat collected during the reproductive stage. In addition, we considered the impact of the compensation of regenerated tillers on PYD. An integrated frost stress (IFS) index was proposed based on the hourly minimum grass temperature (GT) at the regional scale. The IFS index integrated the influence of low temperature, duration, and developmental progress of winter wheat on frost damage and was compared with two accumulated frost degree-days (AFDD) indices to predict PYD. Frost reduced the grain number per ear and grain yield significantly (p 0.05), and reduced ear number and 1000-grain weight to a lesser extent. The average PYD reached 18.3% in 2018, followed by 11.2% in 2015, 4.2% in 2016, and 1.8% in 2017. Regenerated tillers contributed to yield only if the PYD increased to a certain extent. Compensation by regenerated tillers for PYD in 2018 was only 2.8% and 0.4% in the experimental field and non-experimental fields, respectively, without significant impact (p 0.05) on the PYD. Compared with the AFDD indices, the IFS index improved the accuracy of early prediction for PYD significantly, with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.4%, which showed the advantage of considering the developmental progress and the hourly GT. The IFS, which adopted a critical temperature of - 3 celcius, produced the best calibration model, with the highest interpretation rate of 69.5% for variation in PYD. Although the calibration model did not show the highest accuracy in the validation, its fitted line was closest to the 1:1 line, which indicated the smallest deviation of predicted PYD from measured PYD. This research demonstrated the potential of the IFS index calculated by hourly GT data to evaluate frost damage to winter wheat during stem elongation, which will help guide site-specific, post-frost management.

J	Liu, G; Hu, FN; Zheng, FL; Zhang, Q				Liu, Gang; Hu, Feinan; Zheng, Fenli; Zhang, Qiong			Effects and mechanisms of erosion control techniques on stairstep cut-slopes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Many erosion control techniques, such as stone pitching, concrete revetment, and geotextile covering, have been effective at protecting cut slopes along roads or railways. However, these methods are expensive and hard to operate for high stairstep cut-slopes. To investigate the efficiency of several easily implemented and low-cost techniques, five plots with different treatments were built on stairstep cut-slopes. The five treatments consisted of vegetation coverage on platforms, counter-slope on platforms, upslope drainage, a control check (CK), and a comprehensive treatment of the first three techniques. During nineteen recorded rainfall events from June 2015 to August 2016, the runoff and sediment amount of each plot was measured. Soil water content and shear strength of the 2-m depth profile at each plot after the occurrence of rainfall and evapotranspiration were also investigated. The results indicated that runoff and the sediment amount from the five plots increased with an increase in rainfall amount with a threshold of 5 mm rainfall to produce sediment loss. Compared with the CK, the comprehensive and upslope drainage treatments had a larger reduction in runoff and sediment amount than those of the vegetation and counter-slope treatments. After either rainfall or evapotranspiration, the vegetation and comprehensive treatments had the highest soil water content, and the upslope drainage treatment had the lowest soil water content. The infiltration capacity followed the order of upslope drainage < CK < counter-slope < vegetation < comprehensive treatment. The shear strength of soil logarithmically decreased with soil water content in the five plots, and a critical water content of 12% determined the rate of change for shear strength. Finally, the upslope drainage technique was determined as the preferred recommendation to protect high stairstep cut-slopes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate soil carbon and nitrogen fractions, enzyme activity, and bacterial community structure at 0-15, 15-30, and 30-60 cm depths after 34-yr of continuous application of manure and inorganic fertilizers. The study had a randomized complete block design with six treatments and three replications. Treatments were inorganic nitrogen fertilizer only (N), nitrogen plus phosphrous fertilizers (NP), manure (M), nitrogen plus manure (NM), nitrogen plus phosphorus plus manure (NPM), and unfertilized control (CK) in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) monoculture system. Most soil carbon and nitrogen fractions at 0-15 and 15-30 cm were greater with M, NM, and NPM, and winter wheat yield was greater with NPM than other treatments. The NPM increased 13-glucosidase, 13-xylosidase, and 13-N-acetylglucosidase compared to other treatments at all depths. Soil bacterial Shannon index was similar among treatments at 0-15 and 15-30 cm and lower in N and NP than other treatments at 30-60 cm. Compared to CK, inorganic and manure fertilization increased relative abundances of Gemmatimonadetes and Bacteroidetes but decreased those of Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, and Latescibacteria. Increases in soil enzyme activities and bacterial communities after long-term application of inorganic N and P fertilizers and manure was related to increased substrate availability. Overall, a combination of chemical fertilizers and manure can enhance soil health and quality through increased soil organic matter component, enzyme activity, and bacterial abundance.

A field experiment was carried out during the two consecutive rabi seasons of 2018-19 and 2019-20 to determine the impact of sowing timing, tillage operation, and variety on the growth, development, yield characteristics, and nitrogen uptake in lentil crops. The experiment was conducted in a split-split plot design with 3 replications comprising two different sowing conditions (S-1: early sowing after harvesting of short duration kharif rice, S-2: delayed sowing after harvesting of long duration kharif rice) in main plots, three different tillage operations (T-1: Relay cropping, T-2: Zero tillage, T-3: Conventional tillage) in subplots and two different varieties (V-1: short duration: L4717, V-2: long period: Moitri) in subplots. The findings demonstrated a substantial interaction between sowing time, tillage, and variety on various growth and yield parameters of lentil crops. The early sowing of lentil crops (early November) yielded 4.8% more (1,105 kg ha(-1)) than late November sowing and adapting to the short-duration variety L4717 over the long-duration cultivar Moitri resulted in a yield increase of 5.9% (1,086 kg ha(-1)). Apart from providing a higher yield, it also provided an opportunity to take another crop like leafy vegetables. Among the three tillage practices adopted, conventional tillage produced the lowest yield (1,017 kg ha(-1)) in both experimental years. In contrast, a yield increase of 6.9% and 26.9% in relay cropping and zero tillage systems was observed, respectively. Early-sown lentils with no-tillage and a short-duration variety reached a certain phenophase faster than other combinations (life cycle: 96.2 and 98.7 days for lentils in both years). For both the sowing times, the growth parameters and the number of nodules plant(-1) were highly correlated with nitrogen uptake at different stages of the life cycle. High net returns (Rs. 51,220 and 59,257) leading to higher benefit-cost ratios were observed under the treatment combination of early sowing + zero tillage + short duration variety. Therefore, the study found that short-duration lentil cultivars in combination with early sowing in the zero-tillage system are the best agronomic approach for the sustainability of lentil production after the monsoon rice harvest.

Meanwhile, it brings a series of environmental problems that should be considered in agricultural planning and management. The advent of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform makes remote sensing image processing more convenient and efficient. It has been widely applied in multiple disciplines, but few studies have investigated the detection of greenhouses. In this research, four different classification methods were applied for comparing their performance in monitoring greenhouses in the Guanzhong Plain, Shaanxi, China using GEE: the Minimum Distance Classifier (MDC), the Support Vector Machine with three kernel functions (linear, SVM-L, polynomial, SVM-P, and radial basis function variations, SVM-R), the Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and the Random Forest (RF). Our results illustrate that these classification techniques' overall accuracy is >84%. The most accurate classification results were obtained by the SVM-R classifier, with an overall accuracy of 94%, followed by the RF and CART classifier, while the MDC performed worst among these four classifiers. These results would be useful for greenhouse extraction in long time series and large-scale areas, which provides solid information for decision-makers and practitioners for agriculture planning and management.																			0703-8992	1712-7971				NOV 2	2022	48	6					747	763		10.1080/07038992.2022.2117687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07038992.2022.2117687		SEP 2022											WOS:000850666100001

Here, seasonal patterns of soil net N mineralization rates and mineral N contents were characterized in a hilly grassland on the Loess Plateau, China. A fenced grassland, an afforested shrubland and a grazing grassland (reference) with three topographic positions (the top, the north slope, and the south slope) were selected. Results showed that GE decreased soil net N mineralization rates but increased mineral N contents, while GA did not affect these metrics. Furthermore, topographic positions changed the effects of GE, with greater increase of soil total mineral N and nitrate N on the north slope than those on the top and the south slop. Soil layers also changed the effects of GE, with greater decrease in soil net N mineralization rates and greater increase in total mineral N and nitrate N contents at 0-10 cm than those at 10-20 cm. However, there was no difference among three topographic positions or between two soil layers under GA. These results demonstrated that GE was a better restoration practice than GA in respective of soil N dynamics.

Therefore, it is very meaningful to explore the response mechanism of soil erodibility to external environmental factors on the Loess Plateau after ecological restoration. In this study, three soil erodibility factors (K-USLE, K-shira, and K-torri), a comprehensive soil erodibility index (CSEI), different vegetation indices, and five topographic parameters (Topo) in two typical watersheds were selected to achieve this goal. The results revealed that vegetation indices (VI), soil properties (SP), and Topo were significantly affected by regional location and land use types. Vegetation restoration can reduce soil erodibility factors, but the reduction capacity of different land use types varies greatly. SP, VI, and Topo can explain more than 70% of variances in soil erodibility. The partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) illustrated that SP had the largest and significant direct impact on soil erodibility (standard path coefficients (SPC) were -0.935 and -0.895, respectively). Vegetation indirectly inhibited the soil erodibility of the two watersheds by improving SP (SPC were 0.228 and 0.437, respectively), while the indirect impact of Topo mainly interferes with soil erodibility by adjusting vegetation type and spatial distribution (SPC were -0.566 and -0.292, respectively). Furthermore, CSEI was significantly affected by land use, and significantly associated with soil texture, soil organic carbon (SOC), mean weight diameter (MWD), normalized green-red difference index (NGRDI), and vegetative index (VEG) in both watersheds. The soil in the Xinshui River watershed was more vulnerable to erosion than that in the Zhujiachuan watershed. It is of great significance to explore the response mechanism of soil erodibility to multi-scale factors to understand the impact of external environmental evolution on soil erosion and sediment yield on the Loess Plateau.

MADS-Box Transcription Factor <i>ZtRlm1</i> Is Responsible for Virulence and Development of the Fungal Wheat Pathogen <i>Zymoseptoria tritici</i>	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Zymoseptoria triticiis one of the most economically destructive wheat diseases all over the world and is a model fungal plant pathogen within the ascomycetes. In this study, the instrumental role of theZtRlm1gene encoding a MADS-box transcription factor (TF) in the infection process ofZ. triticiwas functionally characterized as these proteins play critical roles in the global gene regulation required for various developmental and physiological processes. Our infection assays showed thatZtRlm1mutants were attenuated in disease development as a 30 and 90% reduction in chloro-necrotic lesions and pycnidia formation, respectively, were observed in plants inoculated withZtRlm1mutant strains demonstrating thatZtRlm1is a crucial factor playing a significant role in the late stage of infection corresponding with pycnidial formation. Our expression analysis demonstrated that the transcript level ofZtRlm1is induced at 2 and 20 days post-inoculation, coinciding with pycnidial sporulation. In addition, microscopic analyses showed that branch intensity and biomass production were significantly reduced, indicating that impaired pycnidia formation is a result of impaired differentiation and biomass production in theZtRlm1mutants. Furthermore, melanization, a phenomenon required for fruiting body formation, was significantly hampered inZtRlm1mutants as they were not melanized under all tested temperature and media conditions. Overall, our data showed that impaired disease development of theZtRlm1mutants is mainly due to the significant impact ofZtRlm1in different cellular processes, including differentiation, branching, fungal biomass production, and melanization, in which identification of downstream genes are of interest to increase our understanding of this pathosystem.

Sorghum Hybrids for Low-Input Farming Systems in West Africa: Quantitative Genetic Parameters to Guide Hybrid Breeding	CROP SCIENCE												The development of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] hybrids with Guinea-race parents is a promising approach to increase yields in West Africa (WA). There is heretofore no quantitative genetic information about the genetic value of new hybrids and their parents, or about the efficiency of alternative selection methods for targeting yield performance under the predominantly low-input, P-deficient production conditions. This study aims to estimate the heterosis levels attainable by new Guinearace hybrids and the combining abilities of the current suite of parents with partial-to full-Guinea-race backgrounds of contrasting geographic origins, and to determine the effectiveness of direct selection under low-P (LP) relative to indirect selection under high-P (HP) conditions. Single-cross hybrids were evaluated in 2015 and 2016 for yield under both LP and HP conditions at two locations in Mali. The hybrid yields were substantially superior to farmers' local Guinea-race varieties, with 20 to 80% higher means in both LP and HP environments. Average midparent and better-parent heterosis estimates were, respectively, 78 and 48% under HP, and 75 and 42% under LP. Direct selection for yield under LP was predicted to be 20 to 60% more effective than indirect selection under HP conditions. The combining ability estimates provided initial insights into the potential benefit of germplasm from more eastern and humid regions of WA for developing a restorer pool distinct and complementary to the female pool from Mali and surrounding countries. Substantial yield superiorities of hybrids over local varieties suggested that a hybrid breeding strategy based on Guinea germplasm could help improve WA smallholder farmers' livelihood.

In this study, we analyzed the vegetation greenness trends in relation to rainfall variability that we considered the essence of climatic effects on vegetation in a well-known water-limited environment by using time series of satellite data in the Sudano-Sahelian region during 2001-2020. We quantified in more detail the relative contributions of rainfall variability (climatic factor), land use/land cover (LULC) change, and fire occurrence change (non-climatic factors) to vegetation greenness trends in selected sub-regions. The results showed that vegetation greening was widespread (26.9% of the total study area), while vegetation browning was more clustered in central West Africa (5% of the total study area). About half of the vegetation greening area can be explained by long-term rainfall variability during 2001-2020, but most of the area characterized by a browning trend was unrelated to rainfall variability. An analysis of the relative importance showed that LULC changes had significant local effects on vegetation greenness and that these changes were characterized by a strong spatial heterogeneity in specific sub-regions. Gains in cropland and natural vegetation related to positive land management were probably the dominant drivers of greening in Senegal and Ethiopia. Also, the combined impacts of rainfall variability and LULC changes contributed to greening trends in the arid zone, particularly in Mali and Sudan. In contrast, vegetation browning in central West Africa appeared to be driven by cropland gain and natural vegetation loss associated with extensive agricultural production activities. Furthermore, we found that repeated fires for agricultural expansion in central West Africa intensified vegetation browning. These results advanced our understanding of vegetation dynamics in response to climatic and non-climatic factors in Sudano-Sahelian drylands characterized by increasing pressures on land resources.

Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) is an important oilseed crop worldwide. Utilization of genetic resistance is the most economic and effective approach to control bacterial wilt, one of the most devastating plant diseases, in peanut production. To accelerate the genetic improvement of bacterial wilt resistance (BWR) in peanut breeding programs, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has been conducted for two resistant varieties. In this context, we deployed linkage mapping as well as sequencing-based mapping approach, QTL-seq, to identify genomic regions and candidate genes for BWR in another highly resistant variety Zhonghua 6. The recombination inbred line population (268 progenies) from the cross Xuhua 13 x Zhonghua 6 was used in BWR evaluation across five environments. QTL mapping using both SSR- and SNP-based genetic maps identified a stable QTL (qBWRB02-1) on chromosome B02 with 37.79-78.86% phenotypic variation explained (PVE) across five environments. The QTL-seq facilitated further dissection of qBWRB02-1 into two adjacent genomic regions, qBWRB02-1-1 (2.81-4.24 Mb) and qBWRB02-1-2 (6.54-8.75 Mb). Mapping of newly developed Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers on the genetic map confirmed their stable expressions across five environments. The effects of qBWRB02-1-1 (49.43-68.86% PVE) were much higher than qBWRB02-1-2 (3.96-6.48% PVE) and other previously reported QTLs. Nineteen putative candidate genes affected by 49 non-synonymous SNPs were identified for qBWRB02-1-1, and ten of them were predicted to code for disease resistance proteins. The major and stable QTL qBWRB02-1-1 and validated KASP markers could be deployed in genomics-assisted breeding (GAB) to develop improved peanut varieties with enhanced BWR.					yong, lei/JFT-1295-2023; Ren, Xiao/HNS-0057-2023; Pandey, Manish/JPL-3773-2023; Luo, Huaiyong/HOA-9541-2023	Luo, Huaiyong/0000-0001-8731-9927													0040-5752	1432-2242				APR	2020	133	4					1133	1148		10.1007/s00122-020-03537-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03537-9		JAN 2020						31980836					WOS:000509164600001

R. Br.] (Poales: Poaceae) flour only, and in combinations of flours of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] (Poales: Poaceae), peanut (Arachis hypogea L.) (Fabales: Fabaceae), and cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] (Fabales: Fabaceae) to identify the optimal and economical proportion to be used under the conditions of Niger. The addition of cowpea or peanut to the pearl millet diet slightly increased C. cephalonica larval development time. Likewise, the addition of cowpea or peanut to cereal diets yielded a higher C. cephalonica larval survival. Female moths emerging from larvae fed on cereal and legume mixed diets produced higher eggs compared to the ones fed on sole and mixed cereals. Among legumes, cowpea addition is most interesting in terms of cost/production of C. cephalonica larvae. However, female moths emerging from larvae fed on different millet cowpea mix (5, 25, and 50%) laid significantly more eggs than those fed on sole pearl millet. Further, individual C. cephalonica larvae fed on 75% pearl millet + 25% cowpea produced significantly more H. hebetor. With an initial 25 C. cephalonica larvae kept for a 3-mo rearing period, the number of H. hebetor parasitoids produced will reach 2.68-10.07 million. In terms of cost/production ratio, the 75% pearl millet: 25% cowpea yielded better results.

Here, we have found that MSW-associated fly ash samples contain an EPFR concentration of 3-10 X 10(15) spins g(-1), a line width (Delta Hp-p) of similar to 8.6 G, and a g-factor of 2.0032-2.0038. These EPFRs are proposed to be mixtures of carbon-centered and oxygen-centered free radicals. Fractionation of the fly ash-associated EPFRs into solvent-extracted and nonextractable radicals suggests that the solvent-extracted part accounts for similar to 45-73% of the total amount of EPFRs. Spin densities of solvent-extracted EPFRs correlate positively with the concentrations of Fe, Cu, Mn, Ti, and Zn, whereas similar correlations are comparatively insignificant for nonextractable EPFRs. Under natural conditions, these two types of EPFRs exhibit different stabilization that solvent-extracted EPFRs are relatively unstable, whereas the nonextractable fraction possesses a long life span. Significant correlations between concentrations of solvent-extracted EPFRs and generation of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals are found. Overall, our results suggest that the fractionated solvent-extracted and nonextractable EPFRs may experience different formation and stabilization processes and health effects.

However, the effects of biochar additions for sloping cropland amendments and soil erosion remain unclear. In this study, experiments with simulated rainfall (25, 50, 75, and 100 mm hr(-1)) were conducted on a soil box (0.45-m length x 0.3-m width) to assess the effects of different biochar addition rates (2%, 5%, and 8% [wt/wt]) and incubation time (i.e., 140 days) on runoff, soil loss, and interrill erodibility. The soil and biochar were loess-derived Miami soil and commercial charcoal made from seasoned oak and hickory hardwoods, respectively. Compared with the control soil, biochar addition decreased the total runoff by 2.4-10.8% (p > 0.05) and significantly increased the total soil loss and interrill erodibility (p < .05) by 20.8-50.8% and 20.4-29.2%, respectively. The changes in runoff, soil loss, and interrill erodibility were ruleless with an increase in the rate of biochar addition from 2% to 8%. The differences in runoff, soil loss, and interrill erodibility were nonsignificant among most biochar-added treatments. After a 140-day incubation period, total runoff and soil loss increased by 1.5-6.2% and 5.7-10.3%, respectively, and interrill erodibility increased for the 2% biochar addition and decreased for the 5% and 8% biochar additions. However, nonsignificant differences in runoff, soil loss, and interrill erodibility were observed before and after incubation. Our results implied that biochar addition to soil could increase the risk of erosion on sloping croplands, and thus, one should exercise caution when amending soil with biochar on sloping croplands.

This study at-tempts to reconstruct soil erosion rates (SERs) quantitatively based on lake sediment records from 35 lakes in China. Environmental sequences, e.g., precipitation, vegetation and human activity, were reconstructed and used to identify the dynamic processes of soil erosion based on the General Additive Model (GAM). The findings were as follows. First, drivers of soil erosion in lake basins in different sub-regions of China differed markedly due to the evolution of different monsoon systems and regional environments. Second, influenced by the evolution of different monsoon systems and regional envi-ronments, soil erosion of the Holocene showed different evolutionary processes in China. For example, SERs gradually increased in the northwestern arid zone and remained relatively stable in the monsoon zone until 2.0 ka (1 ka 1/4 1000 calibrated a B.P.). Third, human activity played a more important role in soil erosion in all sub-regions during the Holocene. Human activities through vegetation/land-use change have led to rapid enhancement of soil erosion in the north, south, and southwest China since 2.0 ka, especially in the last 1000 years. This study contributes to our understanding of the evolution of soil erosion under different climate systems in China.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.					Delang, Claudio O.

This study aimed to determine the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in P-use efficiency in two maize genotypes with contrasting root systems in response to low P stress. Maize genotypes small-rooted Shengrui 999 and large-rooted Zhongke 11 were grown in rhizoboxes that were inoculated with or without AMF (Funneliformis mosseae) under low P (no added P) or optimal P (200 mg kg(-1)) for 53 days. Low P stress significantly inhibited shoot and root growth, photosynthesis, tissue P content, and root P concentration in both genotypes. Shengrui 999 was more tolerant to P stress with less reduction of these traits compared to Zhongke 11. Shengrui 999 had a higher AMF infection rate than Zhongke 11 at both P levels. Under P deficit, inoculation with AMF significantly promoted plant growth and P uptake in both genotypes with more profound effects seen in Zhongke 11, whilst Shengrui 999 was more dependent on AMF under optimal P. Low P stress inhibited the growth and physiological attributes of both genotypes. The small-rooted Shengrui 999 was more tolerant to low P than Zhongke 11. Inoculation with AMF alleviates low P stress in both genotypes with a more profound effect on Zhongke 11 at low P and on Shengrui 999 at high P conditions.

However, we do not know well how the functioning of different types of grassland ecosystems is associated with variation in temperature and precipitation. Here, we used long-term field measurements to examine how climatic changes between the 1980s and the 2010s (i.e., growing season temperature, precipitation, habitat moisture index, solar radiation, and sunshine duration) have affected aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) for all major grassland types in northern China. We found that ANPP consistently declined over the 30-year period across all types of grassland, on average by about 6.1%. Warming, associated with increased solar radiation and, hence, soil temperature, was the primary factor driving the decrease of ANPP. We further show that ANPP was more sensitive to climate change in alpine and lowland grasslands than in temperate grasslands. Together, our findings indicate that climate warming consistently reduces plant productivity of different types of grassland ecosystems, and emphasize the importance of soil temperature in driving the decline in grassland productivity under climate change.					, 菜鸟刘/GOK-1944-2022; Liu, Yu/JJE-7800-2023; Alatalo, Juha/C-1269-2018	Liu, Yu/0000-0003-0706-4026; Alatalo, Juha/0000-0001-5084-850X; Wu, Gao-Lin/0000-0002-5449-7134														2328-4277				JUN	2021	9	6							e2020EF001837	10.1029/2020EF001837	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001837													WOS:000666656400003

To do this, this study evaluated changing trends and detected transition years for both streamflow and sediment discharge using long-term historical records at seven hydrological stations in the Ganjiang River basin over the past 50 years. The double mass curve (DMC) method was used to quantify the effects of both climate change and human activities on hydrological regime shifts. The results showed that the distributions of precipitation, streamflow, and sediment discharge within a year are extremely uneven and mainly concentrated in the flood season of Jiangxi Province. None of the stations showed significant trends over time for either annual precipitation or streamflow, while the annual sediment discharge at most stations decreased significantly over time. The estimation of sediment discharge via DMC indicated that after the transition years, there were rapid reductions in sediment discharge at all hydrological stations, and the average decline degree of midstream and downstream were much larger than that of upstream. Human activities, especially the increase of vegetation cover and construction of large and medium-sized reservoirs, provided a significantly greater contribution to the reduction of sediment discharge than did precipitation changes. As a case study of river evolution under global change environment, this study could provide scientific basis for the control of soil erosion and the management of water resources in Ganjiang River, as well as for the related research of Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River basin of China.						zhang, yongfen/0000-0003-3113-7731														2073-4441				AUG	2019	11	8							1679	10.3390/w11081679	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11081679													WOS:000484561500153

Mitigation strategies to enhance carbon sink potential in climate vulnerable districts of Eastern India	CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT												As per the commitment of COP-21, reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under various production systems without affecting productivity is one of the important challenges in addressing global warming. To address this, environmentally and economically efficient climate resilient management practices were identified under the National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) project and were implemented in the sixteen study villages of four districts of Eastern India. In this study, the GHG emissions in terms of C balance in tCO(2)eq due to the adoption of climate resilient practices in agriculture, livestock and forestry were estimated using the EX-ACT model that was developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN). EX-ACT tool was found to be an user-friendly and easy tool to assess the C balance in small areas with diverse climate and soil types. The findings of this study reveal that there is a sink due to the adoption of mitigation strategies (climate resilient management practices) in annuals, perennials and afforestration, while a source (emissions) was observed in irrigated rice, land use change and fertilizer use (inputs). When all the components were considered instead of a single component, the overall C balance in the study villages was found negative, suggesting a sink.

However, the GHR processes and mechanisms for GHs on vegetation-covered lands are unclear. A series of simulated experiments were conducted on a typical grassland (Medicago sativa L. dominated) under different inflow rates (3.6-9.6 m3 h-1) to explore the hydraulic and mass movement properties, morphology evolution, and sediment yield process of GHs induced by surface flow. The results show that the jet flow dominated and accounted for 51.94%-63.33% of the inflow volume; the on-wall flow (including seepage flow) rate linearly increased from 1.40 to 3.08 m3 h-1, while its proportion decreased with increasing inflow rate. A scour hole could gradually develop on the headwall due to the on-wall flow scouring, seepage, and scour hole collapse, resulting in an overhanging mass. A critical scour hole size was observed when the gully headwall overhanging mass collapse (GHOC) occurred under different inflow rates. Additionally, GHOC occurred earlier under the higher inflow rate, which was associated with the more significant increasing rate of the scour hole size under the higher on-wall flow rate. The plunge pool obtained the maximum depth and length before the GHOC, and the higher the inflow rate that was applied, the higher the maximum depth and length that were observed. The sediment yield rate decreased over time with fluctuations, and the maximum values resulting from the GHOCs were 1.60-5.06 times the initial values. Plunge pool erosion had limited effects on GHR, while scour hole development on the headwall and subsequent overhanging mass collapse played critical roles in GHR on grassland under surface flow.

However, the response of microbial activities to long-term warming over decades is poorly understood. To determine how warming changes ecoenzyme activity and microbial nutrient limitation, we conducted a long-term, 21 years, experiment, on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We selected typical grass- and shrub-covered plots, used fiberglass open-top chambers (OTCs) to raise the temperature, conducted soil sampling at different depths, studied the response of nutrient-acquiring enzyme activity and stoichiometry, and conducted vector analysis of stoichiometry. Our results showed that long-term warming did not have a notable effect on the activity of nutrient-acquiring enzymes or enzymatic stoichiometry. However, Spearman correlation analysis indicated a significant and positive correlation between ecoenzyme activity and the available nutrients and microbial biomass in soil. Vector analysis of stoichiometry showed phosphorus limitation for all soil microbes at different depths, regardless of whether the soil experienced warming. These changes in enzymatic stoichiometry and vector analysis suggested that microbial nutrient limitation was not alleviated substantially by long-term warming, and warming did not considerably affect the stratification of microbial nutrient limitation. Our research has also shown that long-term warming does not significantly change soil ecoenzyme activity and original microbial nutrient limitation at different soil depths within the OTUs' impact range. These results could help improve understanding of microbial thermal acclimation and response to future long-term global warming.					li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; chen, wenjing/IZE-8536-2023														2662-2289	2662-2297				DEC	2022	4	4					383	398		10.1007/s42832-021-0116-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42832-021-0116-0		SEP 2021											WOS:000702572500001

We collected carcasses of three potamodromous species that perished during these events to reconstruct their lifetime movements and identify potential recovery mechanisms. Golden perch Macquaria ambigua, Murray cod Maccullochella peelii and silver perch Bidyanus bidyanus otolith Sr-87/Sr-86 profiles were compared with water Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios to better understand natal provenance and movement history, and to identify the scale at which migration influences population processes. Golden perch were predominantly locally spawned (Darling River), although we found some evidence of emigration into the nearby Murray River early in life and return movements into the Darling River. Murray cod were mainly locally spawned and thereafter lifelong residents, with some evidence of stocking supplementing populations. Silver perch were mostly immigrants, with the Murray River (>500 km away) the principal source of fish. For recovery of native fish populations to be effective in the Darling River, recovery actions are required that incorporate knowledge on the relevant spatial and temporal scales over which life history processes occur.

The Caatinga is located in the semi-arid region of Brazil and its vegetation phenology is highly dependent on precipitation, which has a high spatial and temporal variability. Under these circumstances, satellite image-based methods are valued due to their ability to uncover human-induced changes from climate effects on land cover. In this study, a time series stack of 670 Landsat images over a period of 31 years (1985-2015) was used to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of landcover clearing (LCC) due to vegetation removal in an area of the Caatinga. We compared the LCC detection accuracy of three spectral indices, i.e., the surface albedo (SA), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We applied a residual trend analysis (TSS-RESTREND) to attenuate seasonal climate effects on the vegetation time series signal and to detect only significant structural changes (breakpoints) from monthly Landsat time series. Our results show that SA was able to identify the general occurrence of LCC and the year that it occurred with a higher accuracy (89 and 62%, respectively) compared to EVI (44 and 22%) and NDVI (46 and 22%). The overall outcome of the study shows the benefits of using Landsat time series and a spectral index that incorporates the short-wave infrared range, such as the SA, compared to visible and near-infrared vegetation indices for monitoring LCC in seasonally dry forests such as the Caatinga.

GROWTH RESPONSES OF THE PERENNIAL GRASS ,<i> PHALARISAQUATICA</i> L., TO CUTTING FREQUENCY AND INFLUENCE ON SECONDARY METABOLITES AND ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY	JOURNAL OF THE ASABE												Perennial grasses are the key to the economic and environmental sustainability of pastures for livestock, and in arid and semi-arid environments, they can provide multiple ecosystem services more effectively than production systems based on annual crops. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different defoliation frequencies on forage production and nutritive value of the Phalaris aquatica L. variety Soukra under field conditions in Tunis, Tunisia, over a period of 12 weeks. We tested four defoliation frequencies: (1) severe, (2) moderate, (3) infrequent, and (4) control. The growth responses measured were plant tiller number (NT), dry matter production (DM), and relative leaf regrowth rate (RLR). DM under the severe and moderate defoliation frequencies was 7% and 41% less than under control defoliation, respectively. However, DM production under infrequent defoliation was 91% and 43% higher than under severe and moder-ate defoliation. The relative leaf regrowth rate was affected by defoliation frequency; the highest regrowth rate was under severe treatment. However, tillering of P. aquatica was reduced under the severe and moderate frequencies of defoliation. Under increased defoliation frequencies, concentrations of secondary metabolites significantly decreased; total polyphenol content, flavonoid content, and tannin contents were higher in control and infrequent than in moderate and severe treatments. Antioxidant activity also decreased significantly with defoliation compared to the control treatment. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in ABTS (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) among the defoliation frequencies. Pearson's r cor-relation and PCA (Principal component analysis) data revealed that growth parameters, secondary metabolites, and antiox-idant activity have positive and negative correlations in distinguishing the control and defoliation treatments. Results indicate that P. aquatica management should target moderate harvest rates in the adoption of perennial grass forage production systems in Tunisia. Use of perennial grasses for forage production can contribute to sustained production, food security, and rural livelihoods, and move farming systems towards providing multiple economic, environmental, and social benefits.

The objective of this study was to analyze the sampling procedures that lead to the most representative sample for soil aqueous phase composition when using a falling head suction cup. This was achieved by simulating simultaneously the hydraulic and geochemical response of the suction cup sampled soil solution and its immediate surroundings when evacuated by a system-dependent variable boundary condition. Different soils, water contents, vacuum applications, and suction cup internal volumes, as well as variable hydraulic conductivities of the ceramic cup, were evaluated, and their effects on the sampling rate and sample chemical composition were reported. Model results showed that potential extracted soil solution volume depends on a combination of internal suction cup volume and vacuum applied, independently from soil type or water content. A linear relationship was defined between the ratio of the extracted sample to suction cup volume and the initial applied vacuum, for all simulations. The pH values and general chemistry of the sampled solution were found to be more similar to those in the soil when a porous cup system is filled until hydraulic equilibrium is reached. Following this, a small volume suction cup system with a high initial applied vacuum, which allows for faster sample collection, could be optimal.

We conducted a case study of a catchment in southwestern Australia to assess the impacts of future climate and land use changes, both separately and in combination, on water resource availability. For this evaluation, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was first calibrated and then forced by 34 global climate models (GCMs), under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and five land use scenarios (LU0-4). Our results suggested that SWAT reproduced the observed monthly streamflow well. Land use changes have impacts on all hydrologic variables, especially on runoff at the annual scale. Future runoff was projected to decrease in all seasons, especially winter and spring. For the combined effects of climate and land use changes, the results of LU1-4 were only slightly different from the response of LU0. An uncertainty analysis shows that GCMs had the greatest contribution to hydrologic variables, followed by RCPs and land use scenarios. Hence, it is advisable for impacts analysis to use an ensemble of GCMs under different RCPs to minimize the uncertainty of projected future hydrologic variables.					zhang, mingxi/GYI-9562-2022; Wang, Bin/AFI-6568-2022	Wang, Bin/0000-0002-6422-5802; zhang, mingxi/0000-0002-5431-9274; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908														2073-4433				SEP	2022	13	9							1428	10.3390/atmos13091428	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13091428													WOS:000860873800001

Enhancement of plant stress resistance by NaCl pretreatment has been reported, but the mechanism by which NaCl pretreatment activates cotton stress resistance remains unclear. In this study, upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum cv H177) was used as the material to conducted the treatments with three replications: 0 Mm NaCl + 0% PEG6000 (Polyethylene glycol), 0 mM NaCl + 15% PEG6000, 50 mM NaCl + 15% PEG6000 to explore the molecular mechanism by which NaCl improves the drought tolerance of cotton. The results showed that pretreatment with 50 mM NaCl could alleviate the adverse effects of PEG on cotton seeds while promoting the elongation of root length. RNA-seq showed that NaCl specifically induced the expression of carotenoid-related genes. By silencing the upstream gene GHLUT2 of lutein synthesis, it was found that the chlorophyll of silenced plants decreased, and leaf wilting was more sensitive to drought. We found that NaCl enhanced the drought resistance of cotton by regulating genes related to the carotenoid and abscisic acid downstream synthesis pathways. This study provides a new reference for the study of drought resistance in cotton and a theoretical basis for the molecular breeding of cotton.

J	Chen, C; Lei, TW; Ban, YY				Chen, Chao; Lei, Tingwu; Ban, Yunyun			Influence of slope, flow rate, and thawed depth on soil detachment rate in partially thawed black soils	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The detachment rate of partially thawed frozen soil supplies data sets to compute the soil erodibility and critical shear strength in rill erosion model. This research aims to investigate the effect of slope gradient, flow rate, and thawed soil depth on detachment rate under partially thawed condition. The detachment rates of partially thawed soil rill were estimated under three thawed soil depths (1, 2, 5 cm), four slope gradients (5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees), and three flow rates (1, 2, 4 L/min). They were then computed with the sediment concentrations measured along different slope lengths of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 m. Results show that the detachment rates on a partially thawed soil slope as a function of rill length are piecewise functions, which initially maintain a constant value before decreasing exponentially with rill length. In the constant detachment rate section, the constant detachment rate increased with thawed soil depth. After the constant detachment rate section, it increased with slope gradient and flow rate but decreased with the increase in thawed soil depth. The detachment rate decreased fast with the increase in slope gradient and flow rate. The computed detachment rates fitted by stepwise functions produced high coefficient of determination, thereby indicating a good correlation of detachment rate with rill length. The parameters, critical rill length, constant detachment rate, potential detachment capacity, and reduction coefficient of detachment rate in the piecewise function were regressed with stepwise regression method. They determined the effects of those four parameters on detachment rate. The influence of flow rate on critical rill length and thawed soil depth on reduction coefficient of detachment rate was limited. The combined impacts of slope gradient and flow rate were positively related to those four parameters. This study quantified the effect of slope, flow rate, and thawed soil depth on detachment rate and help to quantify the soil detachment rate in cold region.

The annual precipitation at the site is around 400 mm, and heavy grazing by sheep/goats has been conducted in the past. In July 2009 in which vegetation surveys were conducted, seven grasslands with different exclusion durations such as 0, 2, 7, 12, 17, 22 or 27 years had already been established. The objectives of survey were to clarify the vegetation changes with exclusion duration, and to estimate the number of years required for recovering the vegetation. In each of these grasslands, 100 50 x 50 cm(2) quadrats, each of which was further divided into four 25 x 25 cm(2) sub-quadrats, were set, and then each of the species occurring within each sub-quadrat was recorded. Aboveground biomass and soil hardness within each quadrat were also measured as auxiliary variables. We used eco-statistical survey and analysis methods of small-scale spatial patterns of vegetation. The followings are results obtained: after 12-17 years of exclusion, (a) the soil had softened; (b) the aboveground biomass had increased to amounts >200 dw g m(-2); (c) the spatial uniformity in biomass increased to a stationary state; and (d) the dissimilarity of species composition between two successive exclusion durations decreased to a stationary state. We conclude from these observations that the degraded grassland required 12-17 years of exclusion to restore vegetation and productivity. We also proposed candidates of plant species to be seeded or planted for recovering degraded grassland in this area.																			0912-3814	1440-1703				JAN	2021	36	1					161	176		10.1111/1440-1703.12195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1440-1703.12195													WOS:000609858300015

The evolution of talus-pediment sequences (talus flatirons) in arid areas was often linked to climatic cycles, although the physical processes that may account for such a link remain obscure. Our approach is to integrate field measurements, remote sensing of rainfall and modeling to link between storm frequency, runoff, erosion and sediment transport. We present a quantitative hydrometeorological analysis of rainstorms, their geomorphic impact and their potential role in the evolution of hyperarid talus-pediment slopes in the Negev desert, Israel. Rainstorm properties were defined based on intensity-duration-frequency curves and using a rainfall simulator, artificial rainstorms were executed in the field. Then, the obtained measured experimental results were up-scaled to the entire slope length using a fully distributed hydrological model. In addition, natural storms and their hydro-geomorphic impacts were monitored using X-band radar and time-lapse cameras. These integrated analyses constrain the rainfall threshold for local runoff generation at rain intensity of 14 to 22 mm h(-1) for a duration of five minutes and provide a high-resolution characterization of small-scale runoff-generating rain cells. The current frequency of such runoff-producing rainstorms is similar to 1-3 per year. However, extending this local value into the full extent of hillslope runoff indicates that it occurs only under rainstorms with >= 100-years return interval, or 1% annual exceedance probability. Sheetwash efficiency rises with downslope distance; beyond a threshold distance of similar to 100 m, runoff during rainstorms with such annual exceedance probability are capable of transporting surface clasts. The erosion efficiency of these discrete rare events highlights their potential importance in shaping the landscape of arid regions. Our results support the hypothesis that a shift in the properties and frequency of extreme events can trigger significant geomorphic transitions in areas that remained hyperarid during the entire Quaternary.

The purposes of this study were to investigate the effects of plant stem arrangement patterns on sediment transport capacity and to quantify this relationship. Artificial plant stems (stem diameter, 0.01 m) were arranged in five patterns: tessellated, random, bead, zigzag, and banding. Two discharges, two slope gradients, and two plant basal cover conditions were used to conduct flume experiments. Results revealed that plant stem arrangement affected flow regime, hydraulic parameters, hydrological connectivity, and sediment transport capacity. The structural index of connectivity (i.e., the index of sediment connectivity) and the functional index of connectivity (i.e., flow velocity) were used to quantify the effects of plant stem arrangement on sediment transport capacity. The latter exhibited a significant linear function with hydraulic parameters, including flow velocity (p < .05). Unit stream power had the greatest adjusted R-2 value and provided the best estimation of sediment transport capacity. Plant stem arrangement did not affect the relationship between sediment transport capacity and hydraulic parameters. These results are helpful and will enhance our predictions of different plant stem arrangement effects on sediment transport capacity.						zhang, guanghui/0000-0002-3801-8439; Fu, Suhua/0000-0002-4483-6075													1085-3278	1099-145X				JUL 15	2020	31	11					1325	1334		10.1002/ldr.3512	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3512		DEC 2019											WOS:000504815200001

SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												The laser diffraction method (LDM) has been increasingly applied for quantifying soil particle size distribution (PSD), owing to its advantages of rapid analysis, high reproducibility, and continuous PSD measurement for a wide range of size fractions. However, some ambiguities exist regarding the comparability of results with those obtained using other classical methods. The objective of the current study was to evaluate LDM-derived PSDs via comparisons with PSDs obtained with the standard sieve-pipette method (SPM) and from the absolute method of microscopy. A total of 277 soil samples were collected at different soil depths in a typical cropland in the northeast mountainous region of Beijing and analyzed with both SPM and LDM. Due to time and labor constraints, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on 100 samples randomly selected for the PSDs within the clay fraction withdrawn by SPM. The results manifested on the average 18.9% underestimation of clay content and 25.3% overestimation of silt content by LDM compared to SPM. These disagreements directly caused the shifts of soil texture class in 44.8% of the soil samples. Significant linear regression equations were generated to convert LDM-derived sand and silt contents to SPM-derived ones (p < 0.01). The linear conversions for the clay content were only significant for the calibration samples, but possessed negative coefficients of determination for the validation set. According to SEM, silt-sized particles were wrongly included in the clay fraction identified by SPM. Eliminating such particles, the clay contents corrected by SEM were significantly lower when assuming the shape of clay particles < 2 mu m as plates or discs with constant thickness-diameter ratio of 1/10, and higher when considering the clay particles as spheres for volume calculation, in contrast to those measured by LDM (P < 0.01). Detailed volume-based PSDs within the clay fraction were further compared between SEM and LDM, revealing dissimilar PSD patterns but statistically similar median particle diameters. These findings suggest the effectiveness of LDM in soil PSD determination. Future work is needed to systematically quantify the impact of other possible factors such as clay mineralogy and refractive index on LDM-derived PSDs.

Understanding plant-pollinator interactions is especially important in arid regions, where the low abundance of pollinators limits their visiting frequency and, thus, constraints the reproductive success of many plant species. Moreover, plants in such arid habitats are exposed to abiotic stress, particularly to water shortage. Plants in arid habitats are also prone to suffer from multiple stress factors, such as the addition of pathogen and herbivore attacks. All these stress factors induce disruptions in the plant metabolism and increase physiological costs that may lead to changes in floral volatiles, thus affecting the communication between the plant and its pollinators, consequently intensifying the constraints on the plants' reproductive success. To explore this general hypothesis, we used as a model Matthiola livida (Delile) DC. (Brassicaceae), a common native plant species in arid regions of the Middle East. We first tested whether water shortage and insect herbivory, inflicted by whiteflies, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), caused stress in M. livida, based on the change in carbohydrates and starch content, and examined whether the plants produced distinct volatile composition in response to these stressors. Then, we tested whether bumblebees, Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae), common pollinators of M. livida, were able to differentiate between plants suffering from water shortage and insect herbivory based only on volatile emission. We found that both water shortage and insect herbivory caused stress in the plants. We also found that the plants produced a distinct volatile composition in relation to the specific stress they were exposed to. Specifically, in comparison to control plants, insect herbivory increased the amounts of volatile alkanes, aldehydes, and alcohols, and reduced the amounts of esters, benzenoids, and phenylpropanoids. Water shortage reduced the amount of aldehyde volatiles and increased the amount of alcohol volatiles. Moreover, using choice experiments, we found that bumblebees differentiated between stressed and non-stressed plants based on their volatile compositions, and preferred less stressed ones. Our study indicated that pollinators may use floral volatiles in their foraging decisions and are highly sensitive to variation in the plant conditions. This suggests that volatile cues may create a constraint on the ability of the plants to secure their reproductive success in arid habitats, that are added to the direct stress created by the arid conditions themselves.

Rain-gauge measurements are commonly used to estimate rainfall erosivity. However, long-term gauge records with sub-hourly resolutions are lacking in large parts of the world. Satellite observations provide spatially continuous estimates of rainfall, but they are subject to biases that affect estimates of rainfall erosivity. We employed a novel approach to map global rainfall erosivity based on a high-temporal-resolution (30-min), long-term (2001-2020) satellite-based precipitation product-the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM-IMERG)-and mean annual rainfall erosivity from the Global Rainfall Erosivity Database (GloREDa) stations (n = 3286). We used a residual-based merging scheme to integrate GPM-IMERG-based rainfall erosivity with GloREDa using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). The accuracy of the GWR-based merging scheme was evaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation against GloREDa stations. Based on GPM-IMERG-only, the global mean annual rainfall erosivity was estimated to be 1173 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1 with a standard deviation of 1736 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr -1. The mean value estimated via GPM-IMERG merged with GloREDa was 2020 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1 with a standard deviation of 3415 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr -1. Overall, GPM-IMERG-only estimates underestimated rainfall erosivity. The underestimations were greatest in areas of high rainfall erosivity. The accuracy of rainfall erosivity estimates from GPM-IMERG merged with GloREDa substantially improved (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.83, percent bias =-2.4%, and root mean square error = 1122 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1) compared to estimates by GPM-IMERG-only (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.51, percent bias = 27.8%, and root mean square error = 1730 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr -1). Improving satellite-based global rainfall erosivity estimates through integrating with gauge data is relevant as it can contribute to enhancing soil erosion modeling and, in turn, support land degradation neutrality programs.

In this study, we used 16 S rDNA sequencing, transcriptomics, and metabolomics to analyze the response mechanism of roots and soil bacteria to continuous cropping and the relationship between soil bacteria and root phenotypes of different pea genotypes (Ding wan 10 and Yun wan 8).ResultsContinuous cropping inhibited pea growth, with a greater effect on Ding wan 10 than Yun wan 8. Metabolomics showed that the number of differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) in pea roots increased with the number of continuous cropping, and more metabolic pathways were involved. Transcriptomics revealed that the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased with the number of continuous cropping. Continuous cropping altered the expression of genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction, MAPK signal transduction, and lignin synthesis pathways in pea roots, with more DEGs in Ding wan 10 than in Yun wan 8. The up-regulated expression of genes in the ethylene signal transduction pathway was evident in Ding wan 10. Soil bacterial diversity did not change, but the relative abundance of bacteria significantly responded to continuous cropping. Integrative analysis showed that the bacteria with significant relative abundance in the soil were strongly associated with the antioxidant synthesis and linoleic acid metabolism pathway of pea roots under continuous cropping once. Under continuous cropping twice, the bacteria with significant relative abundance changes were strongly associated with cysteine and methionine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, linoleic acid, and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism.ConclusionDing wan 10 was more sensitive to continuous cropping than Yun wan 8. Continuous cropping times and pea genotypes determined the differences in root metabolic pathways. There were common metabolic pathways in the two pea genotypes in response to continuous cropping, and the DEGs and DAMs in these metabolic pathways were strongly associated with the bacteria with significant changes in relative abundance in the soil. This study provides new insights into obstacles to continuous cropping in peas.

Balanced fertilization increases wheat yield response on different soils and agroecological zones in Ethiopia	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												The response of wheat to the application of different rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and sulfur (S) under balanced fertilization on different soil types and agroecologies has not been well studied in Ethiopia. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to (1) determine soil-specific responses of wheat to N, P, K, and S under balanced fertilization; (2) quantify agroecology-specific N, P, K, and S response of wheat under balanced fertilization; and (3) determine nutrient use efficiency of wheat on different soil types under balanced fertilization. Trials were conducted on farmers' fields across 24 locations covering 4 soil types and 5 agroecological zones (AEZs) from 2013 to 2017. The mean grain yields of wheat significantly varied with applied N and P fertilizer rates with soil types and AEZs. With balanced application of other nutrients, the optimum N rates for wheat were 138 kg N ha(-1) on Cambisols and Luvisols, 92 kg N ha(-1) on Vertisols, and 176 kg N ha(-1) on Nitisols, while the optimum P rate was 20 kg P ha(-1) on Cambisols and Vertisols. The nutrient dose-response curve did not reveal consistent pattern for K and S applications on all soil types. The agronomic efficiency of wheat decreased with increasing rates N and P on all soil types. The highest agronomic efficiency of N (15.8 kg grain kg(-1) applied N) was recorded with application of 92 kg N ha(-1) on Vertisols, while the highest agronomic efficiency of P (49 kg grain kg(-1) applied P) was achieved with application of 10 kg P ha(-1) on Cambisols. We conclude that applications of 92-138 kg N ha(-1), 20 kg P ha(-1), 18 kg K ha(-1), and 10 kg S ha(-1) under balanced application of zinc and boron could be recommended depending on soil type for wheat production in the study areas.

Determining the changes in transpiration of this species in different climatic areas is important for revealing the acclimation mechanism of black locust and developing suitable forest management practices, particularly in the context of global climate change. Here, sap flow and canopy conductance of black locust plantation trees in semiarid (Yan'an) and subhumid (Yongshou) sites were quantified using Granier-type thermal dissipation probes and concurrent environmental observations from 2012 to 2017. Several physiological pa-rameters were measured throughout the growing season. The results showed that sap flow was correlated with phenological factors across seasons within a year. However, interannual changes in sap flow were affected mainly by the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) at the Yongshou site, and jointly by precipitation (P), soil water content, and P/ET0 at the Yan'an site. Sap flow response to meteorological factors showed less discrepancy between pre-and post-rainfall periods at the Yan'an site. Moreover, canopy conductance fluctuated less with a wider range of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and the slope of canopy resistance as a function of VPD was lower, indicating relatively lower sensitivity of stomatal conductance to environmental factors in Yan'an site. Physio-logical parameters, except for predawn leaf water potential, were significantly different between the two sites. The results suggested that black locust tended to reduce transpiration, modify leaf morphology, and improve water use efficiency to enhance its adaptability to the dryer site. The species changes stomatal regulation characteristics and general growth rate to acclimatize to distinct water habitats.

However, the effects of long-term forest succession on soil microbial metabolic activity remain unclear. This study investigated a long-term forest succession approximately similar to 160 years after farmland abandonment on the central Loess Plateau, China, to explore the changes in soil microbial metabolism following the forest succession. Among them, the soil basal respiration (BR), microbial quotient (qMB), and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) were studied. The results showed that the BR and qCO(2) were increased following forest succession, whereas the qMB showed the opposite trend. Forest succession also increased the activities of beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG) and beta-D-cellobiosidase (CBH). The increase of BR and qCO(2) and the decrease of qMB occurred in the early stage (< 60 years). However, the increase of BG and CBH mainly occurred in the later period (> 100 years). Soil microbial metabolic activity was closely related to litter biomass, dissolved organic carbon, fungal, and bacterial community composition. In conclusion, long-term forest succession changes soil microbial community structure and promotes soil organic carbon accumulation, while the increase of soil respiration and metabolism promotes the release of carbon element following forest succession, thus reducing soil microbial carbon utilization efficiency.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310; Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564													1085-3278	1099-145X				FEB 15	2023	34	3					723	735		10.1002/ldr.4489	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4489		OCT 2022											WOS:000874481000001

The aim of this work was to determine the effect of storage condition on moisture content of Chinese naked oat by simulating 9 equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) and 5 temperatures. The equilibrium moisture content (EMC) of dry sample was achieved by adsorption, while EMC of wet one was achieved by desorption. EMC of oat increased with the increase in ERH and decreased when temperature increased. The sorption isotherm was a typical "S" shape and fitted using current EMC/ERH models. Modified Chung-Pfost (MCPE) model was the most suitable for describing the dynamic sorption process of Chinese naked oat during storage with a ERH range from 10% to 90%. There was an obvious hysteresis between adsorption and desorption isotherms, whose range decreased with the increase of temperature. High temperature accelerated moisture migration by increasing the hydrophilicity of oat surface. Moreover, dynamic moisture migration was imaged by low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), showing that moisture migrated between ambient environment and oat mainly through endosperm where most moisture accumulated. During sorption, free water migrated firstly, followed by bound water and the change in content of bound water was more stable than that of free water. The results of this study can provide a useful information for future work on quality control of oat during storage.

A 34-year field experiment was performed to evaluate the influences of chemical and organic fertilization on soil aggregates and associated carbon and nitrogen under winter wheat in a Cumulic Haplustoll of the Loess Plateau, China. Treatments included unfertilized control (CK), inorganic N fertilizer (NF), inorganic P fertilizer (PF), inorganic N and P fertilizer (NP), organic manure (M), inorganic N fertilizer plus manure (NM), inorganic P fertilizer plus manure (PM), and inorganic N plus P fertilizers plus manure (NPM). Compared to CK, long-term fertilization significantly increased the proportion of soil macro-aggregates, mean weight diameter (MWD), and geometric mean diameter (GMD), but decreased the proportion of micro-aggregates and fractal dimension, especially fertilizer plus manure. Compared to CK, manure treatments (M, NM, PM, and NPM) had a better improvement on soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (STN), particle organic C, and microbial biomass C in all aggregates than the fertilizer alone. The SOC in different aggregates increased with the increased aggregate size, which was because the larger aggregates formed by the binding of the smaller aggregates and organic matter. PON increased in NM and NPM, and MBN was more sensitive to N fertilizer. The C/N ratio in bulk soil and aggregates decreased with fertilization, especially in fertilizer with manure and in macro-aggregates. The improved soil structure was related to the increased SOC and STN, which was proved by the positive correlations among SOC and STN with macro-aggregates and MWD. A correlation analysis also showed that the contribution rate of SOC and STN in macro-aggregates was positively associated with the macro-aggregate and stability. Therefore, the sequestration of C and N in soil was related to aggregate size and was mainly affected by larger aggregates. The results demonstrated that fertilizer with manure improved the soil structure and fertility better than fertilizer alone, thus increasing crop yield.																				2073-4395				JUN	2023	13	6							1466	10.3390/agronomy13061466	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13061466													WOS:001013873000001

Systematic diagnosis of rainfall pattern changes is urgently needed at spatiotemporal scales for a deeper understanding of how climate change produces variations in rainfall patterns. The objective of this study was to identify rainfall pattern changes systematically under climate change at a subcontinental scale along a rainfall gradient ranging from 1800 to 200 mm yr(-1) by analyzing centennial rainfall data covering 230 sites from 1910 to 2017 in the Northern Territory of Australia. Rainfall pattern changes were characterized by considering aspects of trends and periodicity of annual rainfall, abrupt changes, rainfall distribution, and extreme rainfall events. Our results illustrated that rainfall patterns in northern Australia have changed significantly compared with the early period of the twentieth century. Specifically, 1) a significant increasing trend in annual precipitation associated with greater variation in recent decades was observed over the entire study area, 2) temporal variations represented a mean rainfall periodicity of 27 years over wet to dry regions, 3) an abrupt change of annual rainfall amount occurred consistently in both humid and arid regions during the 1966-75 period, and 4) partitioned long-term time series of rainfall demonstrated a wetter rainfall distribution trend across coastal to inland areas that was associated with more frequent extreme rainfall events in recent decades. The findings of this study could facilitate further studies on the mechanisms of climate change that influence rainfall pattern changes. Significance StatementCharacterizing long-term rainfall pattern changes under different rainfall conditions is important to understand the impacts of climate change. We conducted diagnosis of centennial rainfall pattern changes across wet to dry regions in northern Australia and found that rainfall patterns have noticeably changed in recent decades. The entire region has a consistent increasing trend of annual rainfall with higher variation. Meanwhile, the main shifting period of rainfall pattern was during 1966-75. Although annual rainfall seems to become wetter with an increasing trend, more frequent extreme rainfall events should also be noticed for assessing the impacts of climate changes. The findings support further study to understand long-term rainfall pattern changes under climate change.

The climate-crop modeling method is one of the main ways to customize climate adaptation strategies. However, there is a current lack of prioritization and uncertainty assessment regarding the potential of various adaptations feasible to local farmers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the prioritizing agronomic practices (shifting the thermal time of cultivars, irrigation, topdressing schedules, and sowing date) and uncertainty assessment under climate change for winter wheat in the Loess Plateau, China. METHODS: Hence, this study integrated eight crop models (CMs), six global climate models (GCMs), and four different types of adaptation options under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 245 and SSP585 emission scenarios. We assessed the potential for adaptation during the periods of 2031-2060 and 2071-2100 at three representative sites (Changwu, Linfen, and Yangling) in the Loess Plateau, China. The ANOVA analysis was used to quantify the uncertainties in wheat yield projections caused by adaptation measures (ADP), CM, GCM, and climate change scenarios (Scen). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that optimizing irrigation and topdressing timing positively impacted winter wheat yields more than adjusting planting dates or prolonging the reproductive stage across all three sites. By implementing irrigation during the booting or flowering stage, the ensemble of climate-crop models projected yield increases ranging from 7.1% to 8.5% at Changwu, 18.2% to 20.2% at Linfen, and 13.5% to 17.3% at Yangling. Crop models dominated the projection uncertainty, with values over 50% at all three sites. However, adaptation strategies would dominate the uncertainty in yield projection when the number of crop models used was less than five. Furthermore, the uncertainty in yield projection due to individual crop models varied depending on the study sites and adaptation options. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings could provide valuable guidance to modelers in selecting appropriate climate-crop models to develop effective adaptation options for addressing climate change challenges. Additionally, our findings will provide guidance to producers in the Loess Plateau to optimize food production under climate change.																			0308-521X	1873-2267				DEC	2023	212								103770	10.1016/j.agsy.2023.103770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2023.103770		SEP 2023											WOS:001084674100001

A complex soil created by applying soft rocks into sandy soil can be cultivated. However, the strong water-retaining ability and extreme poverty in nutrients of this complex soil has a negative effect on plant growth. To solve this problem, a complex of microbes and bacterial manure (BM) was added to the complex soil. The soil column culture test was used to detect the influence of BM application on soil bulk-density and infiltration parameters, and a pot experiment was conducted to evaluate its effect on the physical and chemical properties of soil, and ryegrass growth. The addition of 0.15% of BM to the complex soil decreased soil bulk-density, and increased the wetting front migration distance and soil hydraulic conductivity. The BM application also increased soil enzyme activities, which increased the available nitrogen and phosphorus content. As a result, BM increased the ryegrass root and shoot biomass. Overall, this study indicates that BM could be used as an eco-friendly sandy soil conditioner for improving the quality of complex soils, thereby, sustaining agricultural production in arid and semi-arid regions.					yan, jiakun/GRJ-3297-2022; yan, jiakun J/F-5013-2011; liu, pu/HOH-6399-2023; Yan, Jiakun/AAN-5352-2020	yan, jiakun/0000-0001-8844-6098; Yan, Jiakun/0000-0001-8844-6098; Ningning, Zhang/0000-0002-4301-7684														2073-4395				MAR	2021	11	3							568	10.3390/agronomy11030568	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11030568													WOS:000633224600001

Five rates of N fertilization were applied to different plots to compare the soil respiration rate and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)). Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased mean annual cumulative soil respiration (R-cum) by 25%-44%. R-cum had a positive correlation with grain yield, and the carbon emission efficiency (grain yield produced per unit of carbon emission) under N-fertilized plots was 1.62-2.52 times that of unfertilized plots. R-cum also had a positive correlation with root biomass and the root N concentration but showed a negative correlation with the root C/N ratio. The Q(10) values under N-fertilized plots decreased by half at a diurnal scale, but had a smaller reduction (i.e., 0.04-0.09) at an annual scale compared to unfertilized plots. The decreased Q(10) values under N-fertilized plots also resulted from the lower aromaticity of dissolved carbon (SUVA(254)) (7.40 vs. 10.53 L mg C-1 m(-1)). In addition, the altered R-cum and Q(10) values were affected by the varied bacteria community derived from N fertilization, which was related to Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Therefore, N fertilizer applications regulate the combined effects of soil and crop parameters on soil respiration and the Q(10) value. This study suggests that, due to the lower carbon emission efficiency and higher SOC concentration under N-fertilized plots, N fertilizer applications may be used to sustain crop yields and increasing SOC storage while minimizing carbon emission impacts to the environment on the Loess Plateau.

Although different sources of uncertainty in projected crop yields have been quantified in climate change impact assessments, uncertainty in simulating the crop adaptation to future climate has not been fully assessed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the uncertainty in simulating maize adaptation to future climate change with two adaptation options (adjusting planting date and shifting cultivars) at four contrasting sites across China's Maize Belt.METHODS: Maize yield with adaptation was simulated using three crop models (APSIM, DSSAT-CERES, and STICS) driven by 22 global climate models (GCMs) under four emission scenarios of future societal development pathway (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) during two periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that late planting had a greater potential to cope with climate change at most study sites. However, all sites required new cultivars with increased thermal time requirements. Under optimum management options at the four study sites, rainfed maize yields were likely to increase by 1.9%-68.3% compared with yields obtained without adaptation. For the adaptation simulation using adjusted planting date alone, GCM was the major source of uncertainty, accounting for 22.9%-36.7% of the total uncertainty at all sites except a high-altitude site where changing planting time was the major source of uncertainty (32.4%). For the adaptation simulation using shifting cultivar alone, crop model was the dominant source of uncertainty, ac-counting for 24.0%-38.0% of the total uncertainty at all sites except a high-latitude site where shifting cultivar was the major source of uncertainty (34.0%). These findings demonstrated that adaptation options have great potential for increasing maize yields, and the major source of uncertainty depends on study sites and adaptation type used.SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study advance the understanding of the dominant sources of uncertainty in crop yield under different climate adaptations, thereby improving our confidence in assessments of future climate impact on maize yields determined by different adaptation strategies.

This study evaluated the impacts of climate change on water resource availability of a catchment in eastern Australia (i.e. the Manning River catchment) and analyzed climate-hydrology relationships. For this evaluation, the Xinanjiang (XAJ) model was used and validated to simulate monthly rainfall-runoff relationships of the catchment. Statistically downscaled climate data based on 28 global climate models (GCMs) under RCP8.5 scenarios were used to assess the impacts of climate changes on the Manning River catchment. Our results showed that the XAJ model was able to reproduce observed monthly rainfall-runoff relationships with an R-2 >= 0.94 and a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency >= 0.92. The median estimates from the ensemble of downscaled GCM projections showed a slight decrease in annual rainfall and runoff for the period 2021-2060 and an increase for the period 2061-2100. Annual actual evapotranspiration was projected to increase slightly, while annual soil moisture content was predicted to decrease in the future. Our results also demonstrated that future changes in seasonal and annual runoff, actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture are largely dominated by changes in rainfall, with a smaller influence arising from changes in temperature. An increase in the values of high runoffs and a decrease in the values of low runoffs predicted from the ensemble of the 28 GCMs suggest increased variability of water resources at monthly and seasonal time scales in the future. A trend of decreasing values in winter runoff and soil moisture content in the future is likely to aggravate possible future reductions in water availability in eastern Australia. These results contribute to the development of adaptive strategies and future policy options for the sustainable management of water resources in eastern Australia.					zhang, mingxi/GYI-9562-2022; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009; Eamus, Derek/AAX-1276-2021; Wang, Bin/AFI-6568-2022; Cheng, Lei/AAD-8855-2022	Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Wang, Bin/0000-0002-6422-5802; Cheng, Lei/0000-0002-5298-9573; zhang, Hong/0000-0001-9369-7481; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUN	2019	573						49	59		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.067													WOS:000474327800005

Intensifying pearl millet cultivation could boost productivity although it may have trade-offs. Increasing planting density would indeed increase the leaf area and the related water budget, whereas a denser canopy could create a more favorable canopymicroclimate to the benefit of the water use efficiency (WUE) of the crops. The first aim of this work was to test the yield response of popular pearlmillet varieties to an increased density and to assess possible genotypic variation in this response. The second aim was to measure the water use and the WUE of the crop in different densities. MethodTo this end we designed several field and lysimetric experiments To increase the robustness of the results, these trials were carried out in India and Senegal, using two independent sets of genotypes adapted to both sites. ResultsIn the field, the higher sowing density significantly increased yield in all genotypes when trials were carried out in high evaporative demand conditions. There was no genotype x density interaction in these trials, suggesting no genotypic variation in the response to density increase. The high-density treatment also decreased the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in the canopies, both in the field and in the lysimeter experiments. In the lysimeter trials, although the higher density treatment increased water use, the resulting increase in biomass was proportionally higher, hence increasingWUE of the crops in all genotypes under high density. The increase in yield under high density was closely related to the increase in WUE, although this link was more tight in the high- than in the low evaporative demand seasons. This confirmed a strong environmental effect on the response to density of all genotypes tested. DiscussionAlthough they did not open a scope for breeding density tolerant cultivars, these results highlight the possibility to improve pearl millet yield by increasing the density, targeting specifically areas facing high evaporative demand.

This study evaluated the impacts of soil bulk density and matric potential on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions through modifications of total porosity, air-filled porosity, water retention, and gas diffusivity. Soil samples were manipulated into four bulk densities (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 Mg m(-3)) and ten matric potential levels (-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10 kPa) in controlled soil cores. The results showed that lower bulk densities enhanced while higher densities suppressed CO2 emissions. Similarly, wetter matric potentials decreased fluxes, but emission increased with drying. Correlation and regression analyses revealed that total porosity (r = 0.28), and gravimetric water content (r = 0.29) were strongly positively related to CO2 emissions. In contrast, soil bulk density (r= -0.22) and matric potential (r= -0.30) were negatively correlated with emissions. The results highlight that compaction and excessive water content restrict microbial respiration and gas diffusion, reducing CO2 emissions. Proper management of soil structure and water content is therefore essential to support soil ecological functions and associated ecosystem services.																				2073-445X				SEP	2023	12	9							1646	10.3390/land12091646	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12091646													WOS:001076572900001

However, impoverished farmers potentially persist with inefficient slope farming for survival, thereby threatening the sustainable GFGP efforts. Consequently, a strategy for balancing farming and vegetation restoration from a spatial optimization perspective is necessary. Here, we selected two catchments with high and low agricultural intensity in the loess hilly and gully regions for a case study. Spatial analysis and binary logistic regression models were used to clarify the effects of topography, accessibility, and location factors on cropland distribution and explore spatially optimized cropland distribution. The results show that steep slope cropland is still widespread, of which cropland with slopes >15 degrees accounts for 46.7% and 34.7% in the two catchments, respectively. Residences and roads significantly impact steep slope cropland distribution, and around 80% of cropland with slopes >15 degrees is distributed within 200 m from residences or 100 m from roads. In cropland redistribution scenarios, cropland with slopes >25 degrees and >15 degrees can be redistributed to gentler slopes while maintaining cropland areas in catchments with high and low agricultural intensity. Correspondingly, 38.8% and 81.2%, respectively, of simulated cropland on gentle slopes needs optimized attributes such as accessibility in order to be priorities of farmers. Our research provides new insights into GFGP strategies for steep slope cropland restoration in catchments with different agricultural intensities, thereby advancing sustainable farming and vegetation restoration in China's mountainous regions.

Here, soil samples were collected from Robinia pseudoacacia stands of different ages (7-35 years old) and a wheat field (control) for a comparative study of rhizosphere bacterial microbiota. The potential influencing factors were identified using principal coordinate analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis, and partial least squares path modeling. Afforestation influenced soil environmental conditions and bacterial microbiome structure. Microbiota differentiation was mainly explained by niche compartments at the horizontal level. Age-related differences in the rhizosphere microbiota were not prominent, whereas soil samples of different niche compartments were clustered separately. The rhizosphere microbiota exhibited remarkable convergence with increasing stand age. The rhizosphere microbiota dynamics were inconsistent with those of the bulk soil microbiota. Soil organic carbon and available phosphorus contents were the major environmental factors influencing rhizosphere bacterial richness. Accordingly, rhizosphere niche predominantly drove microbiota differentiation along horizontal gradients depending on the soil environment. Growth of R. pseudoacacia trees played a non-significant role in the structuring of rhizosphere microbiota in the restored ecosystem. Results of this study enable a broader understanding of how rhizosphere microbiota respond to long-term afforestation, which could facilitate vegetation restoration.

M.; Hu, Feinan			Response of soil aggregate disintegration to the different content of organic carbon and its fractions during splash erosion	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Aggregate disintegration is a critical process in soil splash erosion. However, the effect of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its fractions on soil aggregates disintegration is still not clear. In this study, five soils with similar clay contents and different contents of SOC have been used. The effects of slaking and mechanical striking on splash erosion were distinguished by using deionized water and 95% ethanol as raindrops. The simulated rainfall experiments were carried out in four heights (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 m). The result indicated that the soil aggregate stability increased with the increases of SOC and light fraction organic carbon (LFOC). The relative slaking and the mechanical striking index increased with the decreases of SOC and LFOC. The reduction of macroaggregates in eroded soil gradually decreased with the increase of SOC and LFOC, especially in alcohol test. The amount of macroaggregates (>0.25 mm) in deionized water tests were significantly less than that in alcohol tests under the same rainfall heights. The contribution of slaking to splash erosion increased with the decrease of heavy fractions organic carbon. The contribution of mechanical striking was dominant when the rainfall kinetic energy increased to a range of threshold between 9 J m(-2) mm(-1) and 12 m(-2) mm(-1). This study could provide the scientific basis for deeply understanding the mechanism of soil aggregates disintegration and splash erosion.

Many factors can determine the abundance of cereal aphids and the damage they cause to plants; among them are the plant's genetic background, as well as environmental conditions such as spatial position within the plot, the composition and the distance from neighboring vegetation. Although the effects of these factors have been under scrutiny for many years, the combined effect of both factors on aphid populations is not fully understood. The goal of this study was to examine the collective impact of genotype and environment on wheat phenology (developmental stages), chemical diversity (metabolites), and insect susceptibility, as manifested by cereal aphid abundance. Methods: To determine the influence of plant genotype on the metrics mentioned above, we measured the phenology, chemical profile, and aphid abundance of four wheat genotypes, including the tetraploid wild emmer (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides cv. Zavitan), tetraploid durum (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum cv. Svevo), and two hexaploid spring bread (Triticum aestivum), 'Rotem' and 'Chinese Spring'. These genotypes are referred to as "focal" plants. To evaluate the impact of the environment, we scored the distance of each focal plant (spatial position) from two neighboring vegetation types: (i) natural resource and (ii) monoculture wheat resource. Results: The results demonstrated that the wild emmer wheat was the most aphidresistant, while the bread wheat Rotem was most aphid-susceptible. Aphids were more abundant in plants that matured early. The spatial position analysis demonstrated that aphids were more abundant in focal plants located closer to the margin monoculture wheat resource rather than to the natural resource, suggesting a resource concentration effect. The analysis of metabolic diversity showed that the levels of three specialized metabolites from the flavonoid class, differed between the wheat genotypes and some minor changes in central metabolites were shown as well. Altogether, these results demonstrate a combined effect of genetic background and spatial position on wheat phenology and aphid abundance on plants. This exposes the potential role of the marginal vegetation environment in shaping the insect population of desirable crops. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining plant intra-specific variation in the agriculture system because of its potential applications in reducing pest density.

Fifteen wheat genotypes were studied under different soil conditions and various meteorological conditions with pot cultivation in rain shelter for two years. Genotype and air humidity were found to be key determinants of diurnal g(s) pattern. All genotypes under low relative humidity (LRH) and most genotypes under high relative humidity (HRH) displayed a gradual decline pattern from morning through the afternoon. Under moderate relative humidity (MRH), all genotypes present a single-peak curve pattern, but they differed in peak time, which may lead to unreliable g(s) comparison between genotypes and get ostensible contrasting materials. The stomatal conductance was significantly different among genotypes under LRH and the increased g(s) magnitude is also significantly different when it was compared between LRH and HRH. The present results provide new thinking for selecting and adopting appropriate cultivars with specific stomata traits for the area with various meteorological conditions.

J	Xu, XM; Zheng, FL; Wilson, GV				Xu, Ximeng; Zheng, Fenli; Wilson, Glenn, V			Flow hydraulics in an ephemeral gully system under different slope gradients, rainfall intensities and inflow conditions	CATENA												Overland flow in an ephemeral gully (EG) system includes the EG channel, rill and interrill sheet flows, which comprise an interconnected drainage network. There are abundant researches on the hydraulics of rill flow and interrill sheet flow, as well as their relationships with soil detachment rates and sediment loads. Few studies have quantified the flow hydraulics of EG system which is highly related to the EG erosion and the development of better EG management strategies. Thus, two erosive rainfall intensities (50 and 100 mm h(-1)) and two slope gradients (15 degrees and 20 degrees) under different upslope and lateral inflow boundary conditions were employed to study the flow hydraulics of an EG system using simulated rainfall and inflow experiments. The results showed that flow velocity, shear stress, stream power and cross-sectional energy in the EG channel generally increased from the top to bottom of the slope with different trends and fluctuations under various inflow conditions. The flow hydraulic parameters of EG channel, rill, and interrill sheet flows all increased as rainfall intensity and slope increased. Flow regimes in the EG system were divided based upon the Reynolds number and Froude number. EG channel flow was classified as transitional to turbulent flow, rill flow was transitional, while sheet flows on interrill areas was laminar. From sheet flow to rill flow and EG channel flow, the flow regime gradually shifted from laminar and subcritical flow to turbulent and supercritical flow. The flow force, power and energy correspondingly increase as flow regime changed toward turbulent and supercritical. Good relationships between sediment load and flow hydraulic parameters were observed and flow shear stress was found to be best correlated with soil erosion of the EG system (R-2 = 0.92). This study quantitively mapped the flow hydraulics in the EG system and correlated these with erosion features, contributing to the development of process-based EG prediction models and better EG management strategies.

The bacterial community composition was identified using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing analysis. The input of phosphate fertilizer changed the diversity and distribution of the bacterial community in the soil layers. The influence on the 0-20 cm layer was greater than that on the 20-40 cm layer. The abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria was enriched in TT60, and the predominant phyla were Proteobacteria (48.69 %), Acidobacteria (23.11 %), Bacteroidetes (20.67 %), Actinobacteria (19.21 %), Gemmatimonadetes (12.03 %) and Chloroflexi (8.05 %). P fertilization increased the abundance and activity of functional degrading bacteria. Oligotrophic bacteria tended to be replaced by copiotrophs under P fertilization treatment. A greater effect was observed in the 0-20 cm layer compared to the 20-40 cm soil layer and also for 60 kg/ha P applied by row application. Correlation redundancy analysis demonstrated pH, organic matter (OM) and available phosphorus (AP) were the dominant contributors to the shift of bacterial community along with phosphorus fertilization strategy. P is a major variable that regulates microbial distribution by stimulating carbon-phosphorus coupling and participating in nitrogen-phosphorus synergy action to relate bacterial, aiming to make bacteria interrelated, and further alter carbon-phosphorus-nitrogen metabolism. Our results will further improve our understanding of how fertilizer measures affect soil quality by changing soil microbial communities in semi-arid agricultural ecosystems.

In this study, we examine the benefits of using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model for ET0 and precipitation forecasts with simulations at a 3-km grid spatial resolution and an hourly temporal resolution output over Israel. The simulated parameters needed to calculate ET0 using the Penman-Monteith (PM) approach, as well as calculated ET0 and precipitation, were compared to observations from a network of meteorological stations. WRF forecasts of all PM meteorological parameters, except wind speed W-s, were significantly sensitive to seasonality and synoptic conditions, whereas forecasts of W-s consistently showed high bias associated with strong local effects, leading to high bias in the evaluated PM-ET0. Local W-s bias correction using observations on days preceding the forecast and interpolation of the resulting PM-ET0 to other locations led to significant improvement in ET0 forecasts over the investigated area. By using this hybrid forecast approach (WRFBC) that combines WRF numerical simulations with statistical bias corrections, daily ET0 forecast bias was reduced from an annual mean of 13% with WRF to 3% with WRFBC, while maintaining a high model-observation correlation. WRF was successful in predicting precipitation events on a daily event basis for all four forecast lead days. Considering the benefit of the hybrid approach for forecasting ET0, the WRF Model was found to be a high-potential tool for improving crop irrigation management.

BMC GENOMICS												BackgroundEnhancement of crop productivity under various abiotic stresses is a major objective of agronomic research. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as one of the world's staple crops is highly sensitive to heat stress, which can adversely affect both yield and quality. Plant heat shock factors (Hsfs) play a crucial role in abiotic and biotic stress response and conferring stress tolerance. Thus, multifunctional Hsfs may be potentially targets in generating novel strains that have the ability to survive environments that feature a combination of stresses.ResultIn this study, using the released genome sequence of wheat and the novel Hsf protein HMM (Hidden Markov Model) model constructed with the Hsf protein sequence of model monocot (Oryza sativa) and dicot (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants, genome-wide TaHsfs identification was performed. Eighty-two non-redundant and full-length TaHsfs were randomly located on 21 chromosomes. The structural characteristics and phylogenetic analysis with Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Zea mays were used to classify these genes into three major classes and further into 13 subclasses. A novel subclass, TaHsfC3 was found which had not been documented in wheat or other plants, and did not show any orthologous genes in A. thaliana, O. sativa, or Z. mays Hsf families. The observation of a high proportion of homeologous TaHsf gene groups suggests that the allopolyploid process, which occurred after the fusion of genomes, contributed to the expansion of the TaHsf family. Furthermore, TaHsfs expression profiling by RNA-seq revealed that the TaHsfs could be responsive not only to abiotic stresses but also to phytohormones. Additionally, the TaHsf family genes exhibited class-, subclass- and organ-specific expression patterns in response to various treatments.ConclusionsA comprehensive analysis of Hsf genes was performed in wheat, which is useful for better understanding one of the most complex Hsf gene families. Variations in the expression patterns under different abiotic stress and phytohormone treatments provide clues for further analysis of the TaHsfs functions and corresponding signal transduction pathways in wheat.					zhang, yuanyuan/GYA-4428-2022; Guo, Xiu-Lin/W-7251-2019	Shuonan, Duan/0000-0003-3306-7773													1471-2164					APR 1	2019	20								257	10.1186/s12864-019-5617-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-5617-1								30935363					WOS:000463052600002

Like other organisms, the soil meso-fauna are expected to modify their functional diversity and composition in response to climate and land use changes. Here, we investigated the functional responses of Collembola, one of the most abundant and ecologically important groups of soil invertebrates. This study was conducted at the Global Change Experimental Facility (GCEF) in central Germany, where we tested the effects of climate (ambient vs. 'future' as projected for this region for the years between 2070 and 2100), land use (conventional farming, organic farming, intensively-used meadow, extensively-used meadow, and extensively-used pasture), and their interactions on the functional diversity (FD), community-weighted mean (CWM) traits (life-history, morphology), and functional composition of Collembola, as well as the Soil Biological Quality-Collembola (QBS-c) index. We found that land use was overwhelmingly the dominant driver of shifts in functional diversity, functional traits, and functional composition of Collembola, and of shifts in soil biological quality. These significant land use effects were mainly due to the differences between the two main land use types, i.e. cropland vs. grasslands. Specifically, Collembola functional biodiversity and soil biological quality were significantly lower in croplands than grasslands. However, no interactive effect of climate x land use was found in this study, suggesting that land use effects on Collembola were independent of the climate change scenario. Overall, our study shows that functional responses of Collembola are highly vulnerable to land use intensification under both climate scenarios. We conclude that land use changes reduce functional biodiversity and biological quality of soil.

Global effects on soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity depend on nitrogen addition rate	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Soil respiration (Rs) plays a crucial role in regulating carbon (C) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems and the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. However, the impact of nitrogen (N) addition on Rs and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) is poorly understood. Here, we used 1413 paired observations from 261 studies to explore how N addition affects Rs and its Q(10) across terrestrial ecosystems on a global scale. Nitrogen addition increased autotrophic respiration in croplands, deserts and shrublands, but decreased it in grasslands, forests (including coniferous and deciduous forests) and wetlands. In contrast, N addition increased heterotrophic respiration in grasslands, wetlands and deserts, but decreased its Q(10) across different ecosystem types other than deserts. Nitrogen addition decreased (p < 0.05) the overall Rs and its Q(10) by 19.5 and 32.1%, respectively. The decrease in Rs in response to N addition might be attributed to a reduction in heterotrophic respiration. Moreover, the Rs and its Q(10) decreased while soil organic C content increased with the increasing rate of N addition up to 100-150 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). The results suggest that 100-150 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) was the optimum N addition rate to maintain the soil as a C sink. In addition, soil pH, C:N ratio and respiratory quotient were significant predictors of soil respiration and its Q(10). Our study highlights that the N addition rate-dependent effects on Rs and its Q(10), and soil organic C should be incorporated into global C models to improve the assessment of N addition effects on the global C cycle.

However, the variations in newly input and old OC and N among soil aggregates are rarely studied. This knowledge gap hinders our understanding of the mechanisms behind OC and N responses to land-use changes. Herein, we measured the natural abundance of delta C-13 and delta N-15 and soil OC and N stocks in bulk soils and aggregates (> 0.25 mm, 0.25-0.053 mm and < 0.053 mm) in afforested land to identify the dynamics of newly input and old OC and N after land-use change. Soils were collected from farmlands (age 0) and afforested woodlands ranging in age from 10 to 35 years in China's Loess Plateau. We showed that afforestation decreased the natural abundance of delta C-13 and delta N-15 in bulk soils and aggregates, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 were mostly enriched in the silt + clay fraction. Afforestation resulted in an increase in total and newly input OC and N; however, the old OC and N remained stable in the bulk soils and macroaggregates. Increases in new OC and N were the main contributors to the accumulation of soil OC and N pools in the topsoil. Furthermore, the OC and N associated with macroaggregates accounted for 76.5-84.0% and 42.2-83.5% of the new OC and N in bulk soils, and 52.7-79.7% and 64.3-86.6% of the old OC and N in bulk soils along the 10-35 years afforestation. The coupling effects of OC and N existed in new- and old- OC and N stocks, regardless of bulk soils or aggregates. These results indicated that both macroaggregates and newly input OC and N contributed to the synchronous sequestration of OC and N in soils after afforestation.

Particle detachment from the soil surface depends on raindrop KE. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the drop-size distribution (DSD) and KE of rainfall to understand soil erosion and runoff generation. In this study, we used an optical disdrometer to investigate the influence of DSD on the intensity (I), KE, and erosivity of rainfall at Bahir Dar, in northwestern Ethiopia. We recorded 1-min rainfall observations during 42 events, with I ranging from 0.82 to 46.27mmh(-1). The median raindrop diameter (D-50), which ranged between 1.14 and 4.33mm, was significantly correlated with I (R-2=0.96; P<0.001). We developed indices of rainfall KE as a function of time (KEtime) and of the KE content (KEcon). The best-fit relationships between KEtime and I were equally strong: R-2=0.96 (P<0.001) for both a linear function and a polynomial function. KEcon and I were most strongly related for a logarithmic function (R-2=0.98; P<0.001), followed by power (R-2=0.95; P<0.001) and polynomial (R-2=0.93; P<0.001) functions. The KEcon measured at Bahir Dar ranged from 7.4 to 32.43Jm (-2)mm(-1), whereas KEtime ranged from 38.34 to 1992.64Jm(-2)h(-1) for the observed range of I. The potential erosivity of rainfall events was found to be well correlated to smaller rainfalls depths (R-2=0.60, P<0.05). Our results suggest that, though empirical models are easy to use since they require readily available rainfall data, KE rather than rainfall depth should be used to estimate erosivity in the study area and regions of northwestern Ethiopia with similar characteristics. Moreover, the reasons why different measuring methods in the same area and similar methods in different areas provide different kinetic energy results are analyzed and discussed.

An improved understanding of the effect of soil bund spacing is a precondition for sustainable land management practices on sloping highlands. We examined the effects of bund spacing on soil loss, runoff, and soil water content on teff (Eragrostis tef [Zucc.] Trotter) cropland in an area of 9 % slope on Luvisol soil in the Aba Gerima (micro) watershed of the Lake Tana Basin, Ethiopia. We measured these parameters during 2018 and 2019 on five adjoining runoff plots (each 30 m long x 3 m wide) separated by metal sheets 0.35 m high. We used a plot with no bunds as a control. In the other four plots, we installed bunds at spacings of 27.2, 12.7, 7.87, and 5.45 m. Both runoff and soil loss were considerably higher in the control plot than in the plots with bunds. Narrower bund spacings resulted in substantial reductions of runoff and soil loss. The two-year average runoff depths in the control, 27.2, 12.7, 8.97, and 5.45 m bund spacing plots were 517, 454, 365, 306, and 243 mm, respectively. Average soil loss for the control plot was 25.7 ton ha(-1), whereas it was 17.9, 11.8, 6.5, and 4 ton ha(-1) for the 27.2, 12.7, 8.97, and 5.45 m bund spacing plots, respectively. The efficiency of soil bunds in enhancing soil water content increased with reduced soil bund spacing. Over the course of the measurement period, average soil water levels for soil bund spacings of 27.2, 12.7, 8.78, and 5.45 m were 0.30 kg kg(-1), 0.31 kg kg(-1), 0.32 kg kg(-1), and 0.32 kg kg(-1), respectively. Further cost-benefit analyses and statistical tests are needed to determine optimum bund spacings in the Ethiopian highlands.

The genetic mechanisms underlying this differentiation, however, remain unclear. To unveil these mechanisms, we surveyed the evolution of salinity-tolerant gene families through comparative genomic analyses between the model halophyte Puccinellia tenuiflora and glycophytic Gramineae plants, and compared their transcriptional and physiological responses to salinity stress. Under salinity stress, the K+ concentration in the root was slightly enhanced in P. tenuiflora, but it was greatly reduced in the glycophytic Gramineae plants, which provided a physiological explanation for differences in salinity tolerance between P. tenuiflora and these glycophytes. Interestingly, several K+ uptake gene families from P. tenuiflora experienced family expansion and positive selection during evolutionary history. This gene family expansion and the elevated expression of K+ uptake genes accelerated K+ accumulation and decreased Na+ toxicity in P. tenuiflora roots under salinity stress. Positively selected P. tenuiflora K+ uptake genes may have evolved new functions that contributed to development of P. tenuiflora salinity tolerance. In addition, the expansion of the gene families involved in pentose phosphate pathway, sucrose biosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis assisted the adaptation of P. tenuiflora to survival under high salinity conditions.

One-time sampling is normally used to date or estimate erosion and deposition rates, while time-interval sampling has rarely been applied. Northeast China is an important grain production area characterized by intense erosion and a low sediment transport ratio. Most studies of the region have focused on slope sedimentation, while floodplain sedimentation has received little attention. In this study, two-time steps of cross-sectional sediment core sample collection were performed to examine the floodplain sedimentation in the river basin of the Laolai River, a tributary of the Songhua River. The potential for using 137Cs to estimate the sediment deposition rate for a given time-interval was also investigated. A total of 18 cross-sections were acquired, and three repeated cross-sections were selected for double sampling. Significant differences were observed between the results obtained from the samples collected in separate rounds, suggesting the presence of internal heterogeneity during floodplain sedimentation and a significant influence of sampling positions on the analysis results. In the basin examined, sedimentation often occurs midstream, upstream, and at the outlet, and was mainly affected by topography, reservoir construction, and land use. Sedimentation occurs easily at wide, flat outlets or river intersections in braided water systems. It was observed that downstream floodplain sedimentation was increased by sediment interception by upstream res-ervoirs, but reduced by forests near floodplains. Sedimentation rates were significantly different between the 1954 and 1963 time markers, and we found that using rates from 1954 alone would lead to underestimation. When 137Cs sedimentation and floodplain distribution are used to determine flooding occurrence, variations in 137Cs content and particle size distribution should be considered. River bank erosion in this region should be taken into account, and riparian protection is required to reduce erosion and floodplain deposition. Since 137Cs is absent in fine particles when the sediment is predominantly sand, 137Cs measurement may underestimate the sediment deposition rate.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				NOV	2023	439								116706	10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116706	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116706													WOS:001107190600001
J	Zhang, WJ; Xue, X; Peng, F; You, QG; Hao, AH				Zhang, Wenjuan; Xue, Xian; Peng, Fei; You, Quangang; Hao, Aihua			Meta-analysis of the effects of grassland degradation on plant and soil properties in the alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP) are particularly important for both ecosystem functioning and pastoral livelihoods, but they have been severely degraded in the last several decades. There have been numerous studies on the responses of plants and soils to alpine meadow degradation across the region, but they are mostly focused on single sites and are incapable of determining a general response pattern of plants and soils to degradation on the QTP. A meta-analysis including 61 individual published studies was conducted to examine the biotic and abiotic characteristics in slightly (LDAM), moderately (MDAM), severely (SDAM), and very severely degraded alpine meadows (VDAM). The results showed that the aboveground biomass (AGB) significantly decreased (P < 0.01) by 23.17%, 31.85%, 47.24%, and 66.66% in the LDAM, MDAM, SDAM, and VDAM compared with that in nondegraded alpine meadows (NDAM), respectively. The belowground biomass (BGB) did not change in the LDAM but began to decrease with the MDAM. The AGBs of graminoids significantly decreased in all degraded-level meadows, and sedges significantly decreased from MDAM to VDAM, whereas the AGBs of forbs significantly increased except in the VDAM. The Shannon-wiener index did not change until the VDAM. Soil organic matter (SOM) declined starting with the LDAM, and the magnitude of the decrease increased with degradation severity. The change in total nitrogen (TN) was similar to the change in the SOM. Significant available nitrogen (AN) decrease began with the MDAM and significant (P < 0.05) available potassium (AK) decrease only occurred at depth of 0.0-0.1m in the SDAM and the VDAM. Soil moisture (SM) showed a significant decrease, whereas soil bulk density (BD) increased in the degraded alpine meadow. The response of AGB was significantly correlated with the changes in SOM and TN only in the SDAM and VDAM, whereas the response of BGB was significantly correlated with the changes in SOM and TN for all degraded stages. In the LDAM and MDAM, SOM and TN mainly came from the dense rooting of the turf layer, and the changes of SOM and TN thus had no correlation with AGB. However, in the SDAM and VDAM, SOM and TN mainly came from AGB and BGB, and the changes of SOM and TN were thus significantly correlated with AGB and BGB. Our results indicate that biological and biochemical processes regulate the plant and soil changes in LDAM and MDAM and that physical processes such as water and wind erosion might be responsible for the changes in plants and soils in SDAM and VDAM. Therefore, restoration strategies should be based on the processes and stages of alpine meadow degradation. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, whether these effects vary with slope aspect, vegetation type and time of season were not understood in previous studies, precluding our ability to understand how vegetation affects soil N cycling in sloping land. In this study, we investigated the effects of vegetation presence (plots with vs. without vegetation), vegetation type (grassland vs. woodland) and slope aspect (east vs. west slope) on soil N turnover during the growing season in sloping lands of the Loess Plateau, China. Soil metrics measured included concentrations of ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-) and total mineral N (Min-N) in soil solution and rates of ammonification (R-a), nitrification (R-n) and net N mineralization (R-m). We hypothesized that the presence of vegetation would deplete the soil Min-N pool and decrease R-m and that these effects would be greater in east slopes and woodlands than in west slopes and grasslands. In partial support of these hypotheses, vegetation presence decreased soil Min-N concentration but did not affect R-m. NH4+ and NO3- contributed similarly to Min-N, while 110 dominated R-m. The effects of vegetation presence on soil mineral N and N mineralization varied with the time of the season but were not related to the vegetation type and slope aspect. The soil Min-N and R-n, were significantly higher in woodlands, east slopes and 0-10 cm depth than grasslands, west slopes and 10-20 cm depth, respectively. The R-a and NH4+ increased, while the R-n, R-m, NO3- and Min-N decreased with increasing soil moisture. These results indicated that soil Min-N and R-n, in the sloping lands of the Loess Plateau consistently respond to vegetation presence across slope aspect and vegetation type, and were regulated by soil					Hansong Zhu, 祝寒松/IAN-2892-2023	Hansong Zhu, 祝寒松/0000-0001-6940-5565; Yao, Yufei/0000-0003-4519-5561													0341-8162	1872-6887				JAN	2019	172						753	763		10.1016/j.catena.2018.09.037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.09.037													WOS:000449136800067

However, the effect of MPs on DOM and underlying mechanisms have not been clarified, which poses a challenge to maintaining soil health. Under environmentally relevant conditions, we evaluated the major role of polypropylene particles at four micron-level sizes (20, 200, and 500 mu m and mixed) in regulating changes in soil DOM content. We found that an increase in soil aeration by medium and high-intensity (>0.5%) MPs may reduce NH4+ leaching by accelerating soil nitrification. However, MPs have a positive effect on soil nutrient retention through the adsorption of PO43- (13.30-34.46%) and NH4+ (9.03-19.65%) and their leached dissolved organic carbon (MP-leached dissolved organic carbon, MP-DOC), thereby maintaining the dynamic balance of soil nutrients. The regulating ion (Ca2+) is also an important competitor in the MP-DOM adsorption system, and changes in its intensity are dynamically involved in the adsorption process. These findings can help predict the response of soil processes, especially nutrient cycling, to persistent anthropogenic stressors, improve risk management policies on MPs, and facilitate the protection of soil health and function, especially in future agricultural contexts.

J	Hasik, AZ; King, KC; Hawlena, H				Hasik, Adam Z.; King, Kayla C.; Hawlena, Hadas			Interspecific host competition and parasite virulence evolution	BIOLOGY LETTERS												Virulence, the harm to hosts caused by parasite infection, can be selected for by several ecological factors acting synergistically or antagonistically. Here, we focus on the potential for interspecific host competition to shape virulence through such a network of effects. We first summarize how host natural mortality, body mass changes, population density and community diversity affect virulence evolution. We then introduce an initial conceptual framework highlighting how these host factors, which change during host competition, may drive virulence evolution via impacts on life-history trade-offs. We argue that the multi-faceted nature of both interspecific host competition and virulence evolution still requires consideration and experimentation to disentangle contrasting mechanisms. It also necessitates a differential treatment for parasites with various transmission strategies. However, such a comprehensive approach focusing on the role of interspecific host competition is essential to understand the processes driving the evolution of virulence in a tangled bank.

However, a key challenge facing China's potato production is to realize a tradeoff between economic return and environmental impact. Effective strategies for reducing carbon emission without compromising potato yield remain to be developed. This study conducted a comprehensive assessment by integrating climate, soil, crop, and agricultural input data, crop model and life cycle impact assessment model to quantify potato yields, GHG emission amounts and intensities (GHGI), and economic benefits under the conventional planting pattern (CPP), the lowest GHG emission pattern (LEP), and the highest yield pattern (HYP) across China's potato planting regions including four sub-regions, i.e., North Single planting region (NS), Central Double planting region (CD), South Winter planting region (SW), and Southwest Mixed planting region (SWM). Averaged fresh potato yield, GHG emission amount, and GHGI under the CPP were 21.7 t ha(-1), 2815.1 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1), and 137.3 kg CO(2)eq t(-1), respectively, in China's potato planting region. Compared with the CPP, averaged GHG emission amount and GHGI under the LEP could be decreased by 48.2% and 51.5% respectively while the fresh potato yield and economic benefit could be enhanced by 8.1 % and 18.5 %, respectively. For the HYP, averaged GHG emission amount and GHGI could be decreased by 24.2 % and 39.8 % respectively while the fresh potato yield and economic benefit could be enhanced by 18.7 % and 39.6 %, respectively, compared with the CPP. Across the four potato planting regions, SW had the largest potential in reducing GHG emissions owing to a high reduction amount of nitrogen application rate. Our study demonstrates that optimizing agronomic management could reduce environmental impact without compromising economic benefit and provides a scientific method for assessing crop potential to realize the climate-smart planting.

Increasing amounts of attention have been paid to assessing soil erosion and its distribution on cultivated slopes using magnetic susceptibility (MS), which is a rapid, reliable, economic and nondestructive method. However, the MS technique provides incomplete estimates of soil loss. The objective of this study is to employ MS as a tracer to estimate soil loss on cultivated slopes in northeast China. A typical degraded sloping farmland area with a 40-year history of cultivation and a reference forest site were selected. The eroded and deposition regions were distinguished and the tillage homogenization model was used to predict variations in MS with erosion depth. The soil erosion depth, deposition thickness, soil loss, and soil erosion rate were calculated by matching the MS profile measured in the farmland sites to the reference forest site. The results showed that nearly 64% of the area of the selected slope had been eroded, and sediment produced by erosion had been deposited on 36% of the slope as a whole. The largest MS values occurred on the lower portion of the slope (a deposition area), whereas the smallest values occurred on the middle portion of the slope (an eroded area). The average eroded soil depth was 44.5 cm or 1.1 cm.yr(-1), and the average deposition thickness was 35.5 cm or 0.9 cm.yr(-1). The total amount of soil loss from the sampling slope was 29,338.4 t, which corresponded to a rate of soil loss of 4,630.5 t.km(-2).yr(-1) over the 40-year cultivation period. This result was similar to those obtained by previous studies conducted in the same region using other methods and techniques. Thus, soil MS was demonstrated to be a reliable tool that can be used to quantify soil erosion on cultivated slopes in northeast China.

However, the traditional methods including the soil profile method, soil probes, and the drilling method, are low efficient and accurate for large area survey of soil thickness. In this study, the ground penetrating radar (GPR) was employed to detect the thickness of ME with underlying loessial parent material (LPM) along three slopes in straight, convex, and concave shapes in northeast China. The accuracy of GPR for measuring the ME thickness was verified by using excavation profile and pre-buried iron pipes. The effects of soil moisture and bulk density on soil permittivity were also investigated based on indoor experiments. The results indicated that the soil permittivity increased and decreased with the increase of bulk density and soil moisture, respectively. The relationships among soil moisture, bulk density and permittivity of both Mollisol and LPM could be described by two fitted equations, and the errors of the prediction equations was in the range of 0.32 %-5.10 %. The errors of GPR to measure the ME thickness was in the range of 3.72 %-10.64 %. The spatial distribution of the ME thickness along the three slopes varied, and the concave slope had a thicker ME than the convex and straight slope. Meanwhile, similar trends were shown that the sedimentation at the slope foot led to the thickest ME, while soil erosion at the slope shoulder and back resulted in the thinnest ME. This study could provide an efficient and accurate method to investigate soil thickness for further evaluation and protection of soil resources.

A positive NEP denotes an ecosystem functioning as a carbon sink; whereas, a negative NEP denotes an ecosystem functioning as a carbon source. Therefore, drought plays an important role in the carbon balance of an ecosystem. However, little is known about the point at which the ecosystem converts from a carbon sink to a carbon source in extreme droughts. Such knowledge is crucial for predicting terrestrial carbon cycling under climate change, and consequently, was the subject of this study. We imposed two types of drought treatments on desert-grassland: (1) press-drought, in which the quantity of natural precipitation was reduced by 66% from May to August; and (2) pulse-drought, in which the quantity of natural precipitation was reduced by 100% during June and July. Reco and NEP were measured and GEP was calculated and then regression analyses were employed to determine the point at which the carbon sink shifts to a carbon source. The regression equation of NEP (mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) on Reco (mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) took the form: NEP = 0.504 Reco - 0.086 and, consequently, when Reco equaled 0.171 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), there was zero change in the carbon sink and GEP also equaled 0.171 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Below this value, the ecosystem functioned as a carbon source, whereas above this value, the ecosystem functioned as a carbon sink. Structural equation models (SEM) demonstrated that coverage, standing biomass, pH, soil water content and total soil carbon were the main driving factors on desert grassland ecosystem carbon fluxes.

This study assessed genotypic variation in root morphology and NUE in selected 20 maize genotypes with contrasting root system size grown in a semi-hydroponic phenotyping system for 38 days under control (4 mmol L-1 NO3-) and low N (LN) (40 mu mol L-1) for 38 days after transplanting. RESULTS: Maize genotypes exhibited different responses to LN stress in each of the 28 measured shoot and root traits. The 20 genotypes were assigned into one of the three groups: N-efficient (eight genotypes), medium (four genotypes), and N-inefficient (eight genotypes), based on shoot dry weight ratio (the ratio of shoot dry weight at LN and control) +/- one standard error. In response to LN stress, the N-inefficient genotypes had significant reduction in biomass production by similar to 58% in shoots and similar to 64% in roots, while the N-efficient genotypes maintained their biomass. Under LN supply N-efficient genotypes showed a plasticity response that would result in both sparse lateral branching and increased root elongation as a whole or at each growth strata, and N efficiency positively correlated with lateral or axial root elongation and root elongation at different depths. CONCLUTSION: The total lateral root length was the main contributor to the improved N foraging and utilization in maize under LN conditions, followed by axial root length. Total lateral root length can be considered in breeding programs for producing maize cultivars with high NUE at the early seedling stage. (C) 2022 The Authors.

J	Sun, XQ; She, DL; Wang, HD; Fei, YH; Gao, L				Sun, Xiaoqin; She, Dongli; Wang, Hongde; Fei, Yuanhang; Gao, Lei			Modelling soil hydraulic properties with an improved pore-solid fractal (PSF) model through image analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Soil hydraulic properties are important for studying Earth science. The pore-solid fractal (PSF) model, combined with a critical path analysis from percolation theory, seems to be more promising in the modelling of soil hydraulic properties. The accuracy of the PSF model depends on the accurate acquisition of fractal dimensions, which requires the combination of micro-CT scanning and image analysis technology. In addition, there is a changepoint in soil water movement due to the coexistence of soil micro- and macromorphology. Determining the changepoint and using different fractal dimensions to predict hydraulic properties on different sides of the changepoint can further improve the accuracy of the PSF model. Therefore, in this study, we tested the changepoint in soil water movement and adopted an improved PSF model to predict hydraulic parameters in saline soil based on image analysis. The results showed that the two-sample t-test could identify the changepoint accurately. There was only one changepoint in coastal saline soil when predicting hydraulic properties. Micro-CT scanning and image analysis can obtain fractal dimensions more accurately and quickly. The coefficients of determination of all treatments were above 0.9. The improved PSF model was more accurate than the previous model in predicting soil hydraulic properties. A comparison of goodness-of-fit criteria showed that it is better to adopt the geometrical mean error ratio (GMER) and geometrical standard deviation error ratio (GSDER) as the judgement standard. Due to the anisotropy of soil, the improved PSF model demonstrated a higher accuracy in predicting water content than hydraulic conductivity. The hydraulic conductivity prediction accuracy was negatively correlated with the degree of anisotropy (DA) parameter, and the improved model was more suitable for soils with weak anisotropy. Our research can provide a simple and accurate method for parameter calculation of the PSF model to predict soil hydraulic properties more accurately. Highlights The two-sample t-test can find the changepoint accurately in the process of soil drying. Micro-CT scanning and image analysis can calculate fractal dimension more accurately. The improved PSF model is more accurate when predicting soil hydraulic properties. Anisotropy is an important factor that restricts the prediction accuracy of PSF model.

J	Zhou, LF; Feng, H				Zhou, Lifeng; Feng, Hao			Plastic film mulching stimulates brace root emergence and soil nutrient absorption of maize in an arid environment	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE												BACKGROUND Root-shoot ratio plays an important role in mulching effects on increases in maize kernel dry weight and grain yield. RESULTS We examined the effects of plastic film mulching with fertigation on soil nitrate, soil Olsen-P, aboveground and belowground growth, grain filling, and yield of maize. The 2-year research was conducted in a field with a subsoil sand layer (FSS) and in a field without a subsoil sand layer (FNS) in the Hetao Irrigation District, northwest China. Treatments included two levels of plastic film mulching (FM, fully mulched; PM, partially mulched with a cover ratio of 60%), and a non-mulched (NM) control. Mulching methods significantly increased soil NO3-N concentrations (SNCs) in the main root zone in FSS, but not in FNS. Mulching significantly increased root length density in the 0-40 cm soil layer. Mulching increased brace roots emergence by 20.2% under full, and by 9.9% under partial mulching, accelerating soil phosphorus use in the surface soil layer. Mulching increased grain yield in spring maize via enhancing base stem diameter, leaf area, and relative chlorophyll content, decreased the ratio of surface root area to leaf area, and improved kernel dry weight increase. CONCLUSIONS A high proportion of base fertilizer to total fertilizer input resulted in nutrient deficiency during reproductive stage in fertigated maize, therefore, applying a portion of base fertilizer after the maize elongation stage is recommended for a further yield increase of mulched fertigated maize.

Identification of suitable mungbean genotypes for hilly terrains of India using GGE and AMMI biplot approaches	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: The present investigation was conducted to approximate the magnitude of genotype x environment interaction effects in mungbean crop and to identify suitable genotypes for northern hilly terrain of India. Methodology: Thirty one promising mungbean genotypes were evaluated in three diverse environments, viz., Srinagar, Berthin and Imphal of northern hilly terrains of India. The individual genotype was planted in 5 rows of 4m length in 3 replications in randomized block design. The statistical analysis was done for Additive Main effect and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) and genotype main effect plus genotype-by-environment interaction (GGE) biplots analysis. Results: ANOVA devised that the genotypes, environment and genotype x environment interactions were significant for grain yield. The first two principal components, PC1 and PC2 described 73.65 and 26.35 percent variations, respectively, of total variation. According to AMMI I, the genotypes such as Pant M 6, RMG 1092, TMB 134, CoGG 13-19, KM 2349, DGG-8, TRCM 87-6-2-1, KM 2241 and MDGGv-16 were highly stable genotypes. GGE biplot analysis revealed that Pant M 6 and TMB 134 as winning genotypes for Berthin while NMK 15-12 and MDGGV-16 were the best genotypes for Srinagar. The genotypes IPM 14-7 and GAM 5 were found best for Imphal. Overall, high yield and most stable genotype was DGG-8 for northern hilly terrains of India. Interpretation: GGE biplot and AMMI approach could be instrumental in appraising the genotypes performance in multi-environments/locations testing for efficient selection of the stable genotypes.

Yet, predicting bedload transport rates contributes to better river management, more appropriate river engineering works design, accurate knowledge of sediment delivery rates, which greatly benefits sediment related water resources management. Therefore, bedload, suspended load and runoff discharge were measured at the lower Gilgel Abay River in the Blue Nile catchment of Ethiopia. Catchment area is 3887 km(2), average stream discharge in the rainy season 315 (+/- 164) m(3) s(-1), and the stream surface gradient at the sampling station 0.0007 m m(-1). A standard Helley-Smith (U.S. BL-84) cable-suspended sampler was used to take 315 samples to measure bedload fluxes for the 2017 rainy season. The bedload predominantly comprises well to moderately well sorted, medium-sized sand (250-500 mu m) with a symmetric and leptokurtic distribution. The mean daily observed bedload discharge varies from 0.7 to 427.5 Mg d(-1) with an average rate of 175.1 Mg d(-1). Field observations also show that the bedload dynamics become larger near the river banks and decrease towards the middle of the river section due to the presence of a central bridge pier. The average suspended sediment load ranges from 247 to 220,028 Mg d(-1) and dominates the total sediment yield ( > 94.6%). The bedload accounts for only 0.1 to 5.4% of the total sediment load. The area-specific bedload and suspended load are also 0.6 and 22 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively. The elongated planform growth of the Gilgel Abay River delta in Lake Tana is also in line with the predominance of very fine, suspended load in the sediment transport of this river, in addition to limited alongshore drifting given the low waves of Tana lake. Among the tested bedload prediction criteria, the stream-power based equations of Martin and modified Bagnold performed better. Yet, the bedload prediction performance of simple power regression equations based on runoff discharge and excess unit stream power parameters provided the best agreement with the observed bedload data (Adj. R-2 0.82-0.87). Finally, this study provides plausible estimates of bedload fluxes that are within predicted ranges reported for sand-bed rivers in Africa and other tropical regions.

The role of plant species in PSF has been emphasized for secondary succession processes; however, microbial responses to PSF and the underly-ingmechanisms responsible for their effects on plant succession remain poorly understood, particularly in semiarid grassland ecosystems. Here, we conducted a greenhouse experiment using soil collected from early-, mid-, and late-successional plant communities to measure net pairwise PSF for species grown under monoculture. Soils conditioned by pre-successional species had a positive feedback effect on subsequent plant species, whereas soil conditioned by subsequent plant species had a negative feedback effect on pre-successional species. The feedback effect of plants from different successional stages on soil bacterial and fungal communities was mainly positive. However, the bacterial genera in the soil conditioned by early- and mid-successional species and fungal classes in the soil conditioned by early- successional species had a negative feedback effect on late-successional species.

Vara			Understanding Soil Carbon and Phosphorus Dynamics under Grass-Legume Intercropping in a Semi-Arid Region	AGRONOMY-BASEL												An integrated forage-legume cropping system has immense potential to address the issue of land degradability. It provides a critical understanding of the capacity of diversified species mixes vs. monocultures to boost forage production and the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) and phosphorus (P). In this study, we assessed the performance of Napier Bajra Hybrid (NBH) (Pennisetum glaucum x P. purpureum) + cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and tri-specific hybrid (TSH) (P. glaucum x P. purpureum x P. squamulatum) + cluster bean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) as compared to monocultures of NBH and TSH. The legume equivalent yield of NBH + cowpea and TSH + cluster bean intercropping systems were found -31% and -23% higher than monoculture systems. The SOC increased by -5% in the NBH + cowpea system as compared to NBH monoculture. The carbon mineralization rates under NBH + cowpea and TSH + cluster bean were -32% and -38% lower than the NBH and TSH monoculture cropping systems, respectively. It was found that the legume intensification with the forage significantly improved the soil's P status. The research suggested that coalescing diverse crops (e.g., grass and legume) poses enormous potential for sustaining soil health and productivity in semi-arid regions of India. This study advances the research on characterizing the crucial factors of grass-legume-based cropping systems and helps in assessing the impact of these factors on long-term sustainability.

However, its productivity and environmental friendliness remain unclear. Field observations were conducted using maize variety Pioneer 335 to evaluate the effects of Bio film mulching on soil hydrothermal status, carbon sequestration, and water productivity in a semiarid site of northwest China from 2016 to 2017. Six treatments were designed as (1) CK-1, ridge and furrow (RF) without mulching, (2) CK-2, conventional flat planting without mulching, (3) RFT, RF with transparent polyethylene film mulching, (4) RFB, RF with black polyethylene mulching, (5) RFS, RF with wheat straw mulching, and (6) RFBIO, RF with Bio film mulching. The results indicated the growth prophase of maize from sowing to silking stage received 160 mm of rainfall in cool and wet 2016, but decreased to 119.8 mm in warm and dry 2017. Bio film degradation was advanced at the mid stages of maize growth by 10 days in 2017 compared with 2016. Similarly to RFT, RFBIO significantly improved soil hydrothermal conditions compared with RFS, CK-1, and CK-2; however, its magnitude decreased at the maturity stage (P < 0.05). Both RFT and RFB had significantly higher grain yields, economic benefits and water use efficiencies than RFBIO and RFS did across two growing seasons (P < 0.05). RFBIO led to a steady improvement in soil organic carbon, light fraction organic carbon, and carbon to nitrogen ratio, which were better than those of RFT. Therefore, Bio film mulching might be environmentally friendly but not highly productive.

In order to reveal the molecular mechanism of maize seed resistance to abiotic stress at seed germination, the global transcriptome of high- vigour variety Zhongdi175 exposed to cold- and drought- stress was analyzed by RNA-seq. In the comparison between the control and different stressed sample, 12,299 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, of which 9605 and 7837 DEGs were identified under cold- and drought- stress, respectively. Functional annotation analysis suggested that stress response mediated by the pathways involving ribosome, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, among others. Of the obtained DEGs (12,299), 5,143 genes are common to cold- and drought- stress, at least 2248 TFs in 56 TF families were identified that are involved in cold and/or drought treatments during seed germination, including bHLH, NAC, MYB and WRKY families, which suggested that common mechanisms may be originated during maize seed germination in response to different abiotic stresses. This study will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of response to abiotic stress during maize seed germination, and could be useful for cultivar improvement and breeding of high vigour maize cultivars.																			2045-2322					SEP 29	2021	11	1							19345	10.1038/s41598-021-98907-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98907-8								34588562					WOS:000702152400060

Accurate estimation of T-s at various soil depths is crucial for land-atmosphere interactions. This study investigated the applicability of four different machine learning models, extreme learning machine (ELM), generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) and random forests (RF), for modeling half-hourly T-s at four different depths of 2 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm on the Loess Plateau of China. A field experiment was conducted to measure half-hourly T-s and meteorological variables. Air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, solar radiation, and vapor pressure deficit were used as inputs to train the models for estimation of half-hourly T-s. The results showed ELM, GRNN, BPNN and RF models provided desirable performance in modeling half-hourly T-s at all depths, with root mean square error values ranging 2.26-2.95, 2.36-3.10, 2.32-3.04 and 2.31-3.00 degrees C, mean absolute error values ranging 1.76-2.26, 1.83-2.31, 1.80-2.32 and 1.79-2.26 degrees C, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient values ranging 0.856-0.930, 0.841-0.924, 0.847-0.927 and 0.850-0.927, and concordance correlation coefficient values ranging 0.925-0.965, 0.925-0.963, 0.928-0.963, and 0.924-0.961 for the ELM, GRNN, BPNN, and RF models, respectively. There was a statistically significant agreement (P < 0.001) between the measured and modeled values at both half-hour and daily timescales, and the box plots showed the distributional differences between the measured and modeled values were small. Generally, the ELM model had slightly better performance with much better computation speed than GRNN, BPNN as well as RF models at half-hourly timescales, thus the ELM model was highly recommended to estimate T-s at different soil depths.

Extensive investigations have revealed the involvement of an intricate regulatory network including hormones and sugars. Recent studies have demonstrated that two major systemic regulators-auxin and sugar-antagonistically regulate plant branching. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in this crosstalk. We carried out two complementary untargeted approaches-RNA-seq and metabolomics-on explant stem buds fed with different concentrations of auxin and sucrose resulting in dormant and non-dormant buds. Buds responded to the combined effect of auxin and sugar by massive reprogramming of the transcriptome and metabolome. The antagonistic effect of sucrose and auxin targeted several important physiological processes, including sink strength, the amino acid metabolism, the sulfate metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, the nucleic acid metabolism, and phytohormone signaling. Further experiments revealed a role of the TOR-kinase signaling pathway in bud outgrowth through at least downregulation of Rosa hybrida BRANCHED1 (RhBRC1). These new findings represent a cornerstone to further investigate the diverse molecular mechanisms that drive the integration of endogenous factors during shoot branching.

Lab simulation of soil erosion on cultivated soil slopes with wheat straw incorporation	CATENA												Sloping lands are prone to heavy soil erosion, resulting in farmland degradation in most mountainous regions. Straw incorporation can enhance resistance to erosion by improving the soil structure and reducing runoff. Laboratory-simulated rainfall experiments were conducted on silt loam soil to measure the effect of wheat straw incorporation on soil erosion and sediment delivery processes. Different wheat straw incorporation rates (WSIRs: 0, 2, 4, and 8 t ha(-1)), slope gradients (SGs: 10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees), and rainfall intensities (RIs: 80, 120, and 160 mm h(-1)) were evaluated. The results showed that the total rainfall amount was set at 100 mm. The sediment delivery processes were measured using oven-dried runoff samples collected during the specific intervals. The experimental data revealed that sediment delivery processes increased with increasing rainfall duration and decreased with increasing straw incorporation rates, respectively. Straw incorporation significantly reduced soil losses under steep slopes (20 degrees) and during high-intensity rainfall (160 mm h(-1)). Compared with the control plot, the sediment concentrations, sediment delivery rates, and soil losses of slopes with straw incorporation were reduced by 52%, 62%, and 63%, respectively. The reduced sediment delivery rate and soil loss be attributed to increased soil surface roughness (exposed straw) that intercepted runoff, increased soil infiltration, and reduced flow velocity. The incorporated straw indirectly reduced sediment concentration by improving soil structure, which resulted in a smaller reduction in sediment concentration. The sediment reduction was maximized at 80 mm h(-1) 10 degrees, while the benefits of straw incorporation on soil and water conservation were reduced with higher rainfall intensities and slope gradients. This study can serve as a basis for guiding soil and water conservation on sloping farmlands.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				MAR	2022	210								105865	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105865	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105865													WOS:000790439200005

The difference in grain phenotypic characteristics in the same maize hybrid is related to its position in the ear. This study aimed to clarify the distribution characteristics of grain morphological characteristics in the ear and to provide guidance for research of grain phenotype and kernel position effects. Three maize hybrids were used in the experiment, namely, Denghai 618 (DH618), KX3564, and Xianyu 335 (XY335), and the kernel number per row were 40, 40, and 36, respectively. The X-ray mu CT was applied to obtain five kernel morphological indicators, including grain length, width, thickness, volume, surface area. Grain sphericity, length-width ratio, specific surface area, and volume coefficient were further calculated. The results showed that there were three types of maize ear morphological indicators trends: grain length, width, volume, and surface area were parabolic; thickness and sphericity were inverted parabolic; length-to-width ratio and specific surface area were irregular. The volume coefficient of grain at different parts of the ear, namely the relation coefficient between grain volume and grain length, width, and thickness, was determined. The average value of the middle grains morphological indicators of the ear was taken to select kernels representing stable characteristics of the variety. Within the range of 5% deviation from the morphological mean value of the middle grains of the ear, the grains in the middle part accounted for 26.39% of the total ear, about 10 grains extending from the 14th grain at the base of the ear to the top. Within the range of 10% deviation, the middle accounted for 47.22%, about 18 grains extending from the 12th grain at the base of the ear to the top. This study found that grain morphological indicators were greatly different at different positions of the maize ear, and showed different change rules as extend from the base to the top of the ear. Therefore, there were different grain volume coefficients at different positions of maize ear. And the representative sampling range on maize ear was determined based on the comprehensive analysis of different morphological indexes variation of grain.					ming, bo/AGG-3276-2022; Ming, Bo/ABF-5354-2021	ming, bo/0000-0002-5384-8617; Ming, Bo/0000-0002-5384-8617													1934-6344	1934-6352				MAR	2021	14	2					159	166		10.25165/j.ijabe.20211402.6039	http://dx.doi.org/10.25165/j.ijabe.20211402.6039													WOS:000642084200020
J	Yao, XM; Bowker, MA; Xiao, B				Yao, Xiaomeng; Bowker, Matthew A.; Xiao, Bo			Estimation of annual CO<sub>2</sub> efflux of moss biocrust through measuring and simulating its respiration rate in a semiarid climate	GEODERMA												Biocrust is a potentially extensive living cover in drylands, which comprises much of the land surface, but presently its contribution to the soil respiration rate (R-s) and CO2 efflux is still not clearly understood. In this study, we continuously measured the R-s of moss-dominated biocrust (biocrust and biocrust covered soil) and bare soil, together with soil temperature and moisture, for similar to 100 days each in a semiarid climate on the Chinese Loess Plateau. We modeled R-s across a two-year period, based on its relationship with soil temperature and moisture. Using the model, the seasonal variation of the R-s was simulated for biocrust and bare soil, and their annual CO2 efflux were further estimated. We also obtained samples of the biocrust layer and bare soil surface and analyzed their physicochemical properties and enzyme activities to explain the biocrust effects on R-s. Our results showed that the measured Rs of the biocrust and bare soil ranged from 0.05 to 7.62 and 0.02-2.73 limo' M-2 s(-1), respectively, and was closely exponentially related to the dynamics of soil temperature and moisture (in threshold relationships). The variations of R-s in both the biocrust and bare soil were strongly predicted in a regression model by R-2 >= 0.50 and P < 0.001. Through this model, we simulated the seasonal variations of R-s, which averaged 1.03 +/- 0.01 and 0.54 +/- 0.01 mu mol M-2 s(-1) (F = 225.51, P < 0.001) across all seasons for the biocrust and bare soil, respectively. We further estimated that the annual CO2-C efflux through respiration of the biocrust was 390 g m(-2) yr(-1) and that of the bare soil was 203 g m(-2) yr(-1), indicating that the presence of the biocrust layer annually contributed 91.8% (187 g m(-2) yr(-1)) more soil respiration in comparison to the bare soil. Moreover, the main correlates with R-s shifted from largely abiotic, e.g. soil texture and total phosphorus content, in bare soils to biotic, e.g. indicators of carbon and nitrogen content, in biocrust soils. This finding implies that the contribution of the biocrust to R-s is linked to the carbon fixed and organic nutrients stored in the biocrust layer. In conclusion, moss-dominated biocrust highly accelerates soil respiration and increases gross soil CO2 efflux, possibly through regulating soil temperature and moisture, improving soil physicochemical properties, increasing soil enzyme activities, and accelerating decomposition of biocrust-fixed and -stored carbon.

Although it has limited soluble salt content, brackish water can alter the physiochemical properties and microbial communities of soil over time. In this study, a cotton field that utilized drip irrigation with brackish water for 10 years (Brackish field) was compared with a nearby field that utilized drip irrigation with fresh water (Fresh field). Our results show the following: 1) After 10 years, the Brackish field was saltier with a greater electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratio, as well as less soil organic carbon content when compared with the Fresh field. 2) The more polarized distribution of the most abundant operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was observed in the Brackish field, accompanied by significantly smaller beta diversity, a less clustered network and fewer co-occurrences (edges) within the soil microbial community compared with the less salty Fresh field, altogether demonstrating that long-term brackish irrigation was very likely to form a less diverse and more stressed environment for soil microbes to co-exist. 3) The mismatches between the edge ranking of hub species and the ranking of relative abundances highlight that the predominant abundances of salt tolerant species from genera Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas may help cotton to grow better in the saline soil but may not help to stabilize soil microbial communities. In future studies, sophisticated sampling protocols with high time-resolution are required to fully capture the possible soil microbial responses to event-sensitive ion redistributions across cotton rows as well during repeated irrigation cycles.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				MAY	2020	199								104599	10.1016/j.still.2020.104599	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.104599													WOS:000521110000026

Six plots in a slight farmland with different spatial locations were selected to determine the spatial distribution of soil water and salt and their correlation using the multifractal method. Each plot was applied using the grid method (15 m x 15 m, 3600 m(2)), where each sampling site was located at the center point coordinates. The 0-20 and 20-40 cm soil layers were sampled.The spatial variability of the soil water and salt were 1.41 and 1.73 fold higher in the upstream farmland than in the downstream farmland. The spatial variability of the soil water and salt was significantly correlated. In addition, the spatial variability of the soil water and salt significantly correlated in the 0-20 and 20-40 cm layers. The spatial distribution of both soil water and salt in the entire soil layer had similar characteristics at this sampling scale. Our results provide a theoretical basis to study the interactive mechanisms associated with the distribution of soil water and salt.

The main aim of this study is to obtain high-yield wheat genotypes that are stable and adaptable to cold climatic conditions in Iran. For this purpose, 25 wheat genotypes were evaluated in a randomized complete blocks design with three replications during three cropping seasons (2013-2016) under supplementary irrigation and rainfed conditions. PBSTAT-GE software was used for genotype x environment interaction (GEI) analysis and comprehensive sustainability analysis. The results showed that G5, G14, G16 and G18 genotypes had good stability and general adaptation based on parametric and non-parametric stability statistics. Combined analysis of variance based on the Additive Main Effect and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) model showed that GEI is significant in the term of grain yield. Also, the ratios between the sum of squares G, GE and IPC1 showed that the AMMI is suitable for data analysis. GGE biplot analysis identified five mega-environments (MEs), in which ME I including E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, and G7, G5, G14, G13, G16, G18, G20 being the superior ME I genotypes. According to AMMI and GGE biplote stability methods, lines G20, G18, G13, G16, G14 and Saein cultivar (G5) can be considered as desirable genetic resources in wheat production programs under variable environments in Iran, due to having the appropriate combination of yield and stability.																			1300-7580	2148-9297					2023	29	1					317	334		10.15832/ankutbd.999060	http://dx.doi.org/10.15832/ankutbd.999060													WOS:000977218600028

However, the accuracy of source contribution predictions of different fingerprinting methods has not been well verified, which affects the further application of these methods. Here, compared with the real sediment sources measured by indoor simulated scouring experiments, we verified the accuracy of two tracers (geochemical elements and n-alkanes) and three mixing models (Walling model, MixSIAR, and Landwehr model). The results showed that geochemical properties have high accuracy in identifying sediment sources, with the mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 3.5%-5.9%, while poor results were shown for n-alkanes (MAE values 7.5%-45.7%). The Walling model and MixSIAR showed higher accuracy of contribution prediction, and the MAE was 3.5%-5.9% and 0.7%-3.5%, respectively. Although Landwehr also presented high accuracy of model output, it was relatively less robust compared with the former two mixing models (the MAE range was 3.8%-9.7%).

Previous research has shown that global warming and nitrogen (N) enrichment reduce the effectiveness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). However, the mechanism by which global change drivers and AMF interactively affect plant phenology is still poorly understood. We examined the impact of warming, N addition and AMF reduction on plant phenology in an in-situ experiment for two grasses over 3 years. Year-to-year variations in the phenology of the two species were more apparent than those caused by the experimental treatments. For Puccinellia tenuiflora (P. tenuiflora), only 1 out of our 9 phenological measurements was significant AMF reduction shortened the reproductive duration. For Leymus chinensis (L. chinensis), 5 out of the 9 phenological measurements were significant warming advanced both flowering and fruiting times, N addition shortened the reproductive duration, and AMF reduction delayed both the flowering and fruiting times. Significant interactive effects of warming and N addition, warming and AMF reduction on the reproductive and fruiting time of L. chinensis were observed: warming plus N addition advanced fruiting times and shortened reproductive duration, and warming plus AMF reduction delayed fruiting time and shortened reproductive duration of L. chinensis. Furthermore, for both species, no interactive effect between the experimental treatments and annual climate variation was detected. These results indicate that the effects of warming, N addition and AMF reduction on plant phenology are largely independent and consistent over time. However, the annual variation in the phenology of both species is much larger than any experimental induced changes, suggesting no mismatch for species in terms of their phenology tracking annual climate fluctuations under future global change.

However, collecting sufficient labeled training samples at the field scale remains a considerable challenge, significantly limiting the practical use. In this study, a split-merge framework was proposed to address the issue of limited training samples at the field scale. Based on the split-merge framework, a yield prediction method for winter wheat using the state-of-the-art Efficientnetv2_s (Efficientnetv2_s_spw) and UAV RGB imagery was presented. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the split-merge framework, in this study, Efficientnetv2_s_pw was built by directly feeding the plot images to Efficientnetv2_s. The results indicated that the proposed split-merge framework effectively enlarged the training samples, thus enabling improved yield prediction performance. Efficientnetv2_s_spw performed best at the grain-filling stage, with a coefficient of determination of 0.6341 and a mean absolute percentage error of 7.43%. The proposed split-merge framework improved the model ability to extract indicative image features, partially mitigating the saturation issues. Efficientnetv2_s_spw demonstrated excellent adaptability across the water treatments and was recommended at the grain-filling stage. Increasing the ground resolution of input images may further improve the estimation performance. Alternatively, improved performance may be achieved by incorporating additional data sources, such as the canopy height model (CHM). This study indicates that Efficientnetv2_s_spw is a promising tool for field-scale yield prediction of winter wheat, providing a practical solution to field-specific crop management.																				2072-4292				DEC	2023	15	23							5444	10.3390/rs15235444	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15235444													WOS:001116899000001

Lam]	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												IbMYB1 was one of the major anthocyanin biosynthesis regulatory genes that has been identified and utilized in purple-fleshed sweet potato breeding. At least three members of this gene, namely, IbMYB1-1, -2a, and -2b, have been reported. We found that IbMYB1-2a and -2b are not necessary for anthocyanin accumulation in a variety of cultivated species (hexaploid) with purple shoots or purplish rings/spots of flesh. Transcriptomic and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses revealed that persistent and vigorous expression of IbMYB1 is essential to maintain the purple color of leaves and storage roots in this type of cultivated species, which did not contain IbMYB1-2 gene members. Compared with IbbHLH2, IbMYB1 is an early response gene of anthocyanin biosynthesis in sweet potato. It cannot exclude the possibility that other MYBs participate in this gene regulation networks. Twenty-two MYB-like genes were identified from 156 MYBs to be highly positively or negatively correlated with the anthocyanin content in leaves or flesh. Even so, the IbMYB1 was most coordinately expressed with anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Differences in flanking and coding sequences confirm that IbMYB2s, the highest similarity genes of IbMYB1, are not the members of IbMYB1. This phenomenon indicates that there may be more members of IbMYB1 in sweet potato, and the genetic complementation of these members is involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. The 3 ' flanking sequence of IbMYB1-1 is homologous to the retrotransposon sequence of TNT1-94. Transposon movement is involved in the formation of multiple members of IbMYB1. This study provides critical insights into the expression patterns of IbMYB1, which are involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the leaf and storage root. Notably, our study also emphasized the presence of a multiple member of IbMYB1 for genetic improvement.</p>																			1664-462X					SEP 23	2021	12								688707	10.3389/fpls.2021.688707	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.688707								34630449					WOS:000705905100001

FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												Majority of undernourished people live in rural Asia and Africa, and many of them are smallholder farmers and consume a significant amount of what they produce. This is specifically true in India. However, in the context of increasing commercial production systems, it is not well-known how much food is consumed from a particular food group that was purchased, what proportion of food is from the production of farm households, and how their diets change seasonally. Furthermore, whether the rural market food diversity complements or substitutes farm production diversity in household's diets is unknown. We employed a mixed-methods research design to answer these questions. The research was conducted in three villages in Telengana State. The results reveal that crop diversity has significantly declined from a highly-diverse production system to a less diverse one. The Food Consumption Score results show that on average own-farm production contributes 23% of food (mainly starchy staples), while market purchases contribute 77% of calories consumed (from more diverse and nutritious foods). Therefore, in the study, villages' market food diversity is more important, and it is complementary to own-farm production. However, our study shows that mere market access (the most widely used proxy indicator in the literature) does not guarantee the availability of diverse nutritious foods to households who use that specific market. This is because market food diversity varies from market to market and across seasons. Therefore, we proposed that in commercial production systems improving crop diversity, and strengthening rural markets, are needed. Moreover, incentivizing retail business and subsidizing nutritious and/or biofortified food in rural areas must be part of strategies to improve nutrition in rural India.

The current study was conducted to determine the susceptibility of different varieties of wheat seed to the infestation by the granary weevil, Sitophilus granarius (L.), and rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.), at optimal (30 degrees C) and sub-optimal (19 degrees C) temperatures. Kernels of six wheat varieties namely, Danda'a, Digalu, ET-13-A2, Kakaba, Millennium, and Pavon-76 were examined over a period of 90 d. Significant interactions were detected between wheat varieties and storage temperature for progeny emergence, percentage of insect damaged kernels, grain weight loss, and amount of powder produced per gram of wheat. Kernels of Danda'a, infested with S. oryzae at 30 degrees C exhibited significantly lower mean progeny counts (13.3 live insects), lower percentage of grain weight loss (4.2%) and insect-damaged kernels (6.4%), and powder production (1.5 mg/g). Kernel weight and hardness index were negatively associated with percentage of insect damaged kernels and grain weight loss. Kernel diameter was positively associated with both of percentage of insect damaged kernels and grain weight loss. Wheat varieties with high Zeleny sedimentation values had lower percentage of insect-damaged kernels and grain weight loss. These results indicated that kernel weight, hardness index, and protein content are predominant factors contributing to wheat resistance against S. granarius and S. oryzae. The varieties Millennium and Danda'a can be considered with other integrated pest management approaches to reduce stored grain losses of wheat in Ethiopia. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sok, S; Yu, XJ				Sok, Serey; Yu, Xiaojiang			Co-management of small-scale fishery in the Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia	REGIONAL SUSTAINABILITY												In Cambodia, fishery co-management is an important process to transfer authority and ownership to the communities along the Tonle Sap Lake to manage fishery. This paper aims to determine why the co-management of small-scale fishery has not been implemented satisfactorily in the Tonle Sap Lake of Cambodia. The research was primarily based on a household survey among 404 households for quantitative data, equally divided between the Cham (202 households) and Khmer (202 households). Participatory process was also applied to collect qualitative data from key stakeholders. We found that limited interaction among the involved stakeholders, i.e., unequal distribution of authority and resources co-management, has impeded implementation. The engagement of fisherfolk was infiuenced by dependence on fishery, law enforcement, and events organized by the communities. While the Khmer had better opportunities to participate in planning at the provincial and district levels, the Cham were only engaged in local development activities initiated by their people. However, the latter evinced a higher rate of satisfaction due to their access to fishery resources and to a large quantity of fishing gear. In the future, efforts should be made to: (1) improve resource and authority sharing among all key stakeholders; (2) urgently resolve issues pertinent to capacity building, insufficient budgets for commune councils (CoCs) and community fishery (CFi); and (3) urge law enforcement regarding illegal fishing.																			2097-0129	2666-660X				JAN	2021	2	1					1	11		10.1016/j.regsus.2020.12.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.regsus.2020.12.002													WOS:001045177200001

How do consumers balance between generalism and performance when exploiting different resources? These two long-standing, still open questions have been unified under a common framework by the integrative hypothesis of specialization (IHS). According to the IHS, ecological specialization is structured by different processes at small and large network hierarchical levels, from an entire network to its modules and nodes. From those hierarchical processes, two patterns are expected. First, a modular network with internally nested modules, i.e. a compound topology. Second, different relationships between consumer performance and generalism on different network hierarchical levels. We confirmed those predictions using an extensive data set of host-parasite interactions, compiled from several studies, and spanning decades of fieldwork in the Palearctic Region. We used a set of topological analyses combined in a novel protocol based on the IHS to disentangle the complexity of this data set at different geographic scales, from local to regional. As predicted, the studied network indeed has a compound topology at both local and regional geographic scales. In addition, the relationship between parasite generalism and performance changes from negative in an entire network to positive within its modules. But, as expected, this shift in the signal of the generalism versus performance relationship happens only in local networks with a compound structure. Our results shed light on two central debates about topology and performance and provide insight into their solution.					Félix, Gabriel M F/B-5187-2016; Mello, Marco A.

Purple soil in Earth-Rocky Mountain Area of Southwest China is a unique soil resource with characteristics including fast physical weathering, soft texture, and rich nutrient reserves. However, the prediction accuracy of D-c and its relationship with certain hydraulic parameters remains poorly understood for purple soil, which is defined as an Entisol in the US Soil Taxonomy system. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between D-c of shallow overland flow and hydraulic parameters to establish an accurate model for purple soil. A series of 825 flume experiments were conducted in a 12 m x 0.3 m hydraulic flume. Flow discharge was 8.33 x 10(-3 )to 41.67 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1), slope gradient was 8.7% to 39.1%, and /ill length was 0.5 m to 10 m. Results showed that flow discharge and slope, stream power, and effective stream power were effective predictors of D-c However, flow depth, flow velocity, shear stress and unit stream power were relatively poor predictors. Stream power was the optimal parameter for predicting the D-c of shallow overland flow. Flow discharge, slope and effective stream power were also useful parameters for predicting D-c. Linear equation between D-c and stream power was the optimal model for predicting D-c, which was recommended when flow depth and flow velocity data were available; however, power equation among D-c, flow discharge and slope also showed good performance in predicting D-c, which was recommended when only flow discharge and slope data were available. The results of this study provide theoretical guidance for predicting sediment yield in Earth-Rocky Mountain Area of Southwest China as well as a decision-making basis for controlling soil and water loss in Earth-Rocky Mountain Area of Southwest China.

The Objectives of Stakeholder Involvement in Transdisciplinary Research. A Conceptual Framework for a Reflective and Reflexive Practise	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												Transdisciplinary research is a well-recognised approach to address complex real-world problems. However, the literature on a central aspect of transdisciplinarity, namely stakeholder involvement, largely lacks a reflection on its objectives. In response, we present a framework defining four general rationales for stakeholder involvement: normative, substantive, social-learning, and implementation objectives. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework and analyse how the design and processes of three collaborative research projects dealing with sustainable land management in Southern Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America were affected by motivations to include stakeholders. Our assessment indicates that at the projects' outset, many scientists pursued a normative rationale and saw stakeholder involvement as a burden. In the course of the projects, the substantive objective became more relevant as being closely linked to the core mandate of scientists. The projects also aimed for social learning and implementation processes, which, however, did not remain uncontested among team members. Overall, our study indicates that jointly negotiating, clarifying, communicating, and reflecting the underlying objectives of stakeholder involvement can help developing more effective interaction strategies and clarifying expectations. The conceptual framework can guide a systematic reflective and reflexive practise and support the planning and co-designing of future transdisciplinary research projects.

PARASITOLOGY												The factors that influence parasite associated bacterial microbial diversity and the geographic distributions of bacteria are not fully understood. In an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between the bacterial diversity of Ctenocephalides fleas and host species and the external environment, we conducted a metagenetic analysis of 107 flea samples collected from 8 distinct sampling sites in South Africa. Pooled DNA samples mostly comprising of 2 or 3 individuals sampled from the same host, and belonging to the same genetic cluster, were sequenced using the Ion PGM (TM) Hi-Q (TM) Kit and the Ion 316 (TM) Chip v2. Differences were detected in the microbiome compositions between Ctenocephalides felis, Ctenocephalides canis and Ctenocephalides connatus. Although based on a small sample, C. connatus occurring on wildlife harboured a higher bacterial richness when compared to C. felis on domestic animals. Intraspecific differences in the microbial OTU diversity were detected within C. f. felis that occurred on domestic cats and dogs. Different genetic lineages of C. f. felis were similar in microbial compositions but some differences exist in the presence or absence of rare bacteria. Rickettsia and Bartonella OTU's identified in South African cat fleas differ from those identified in the USA and Australia. Intraspecific microbial compositions also differ across geographic sampling sites. Generalized dissimilarity modelling showed that temperature and humidity are potentially important environmental factors explaining the pattern obtained.					van der Mescht, Luther/J-8349-2019	van der Mescht, Luther/0000-0001-8813-9549; Matthee, Conrad/0000-0002-6836-069X; Matthee, Sonja/0000-0001-7289-6262													0031-1820	1469-8161				2023 SEP 8	2023										10.1017/S0031182023000835	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182023000835		SEP 2023						37681253					WOS:001075121000001

However, due to the regionally limited scope of conventional models, direct applications of the C-factor prediction have been hindered in China. Alternative C-factor estimation approaches often consider vegetation coverage alone. This can decrease the accuracy of the estimation to an extent. In this study, several cropping systems were established to investigate the coupling effect of surface changes under different management practices and crop cover in preventing soil loss at the plot scale. Five experimental (CP, cropped; SSR, roughened; SC, crusted; CP-SSR, cropped-roughened; CP-SC, cropped-crusted) plots were set, compared to bare plot (BP). The impact of cropping systems on soil loss was estimated by SLR (soil loss ratio), according to the universal soil loss equation (USLE). The SLR estimation models were provided via identifying the related sub-factors, subsequently, combined with the distribution curve of rainfall erosivity to allow the novel C-factor estimation. The results showed that compared with SLRCP, the decrease in SLRCP - SSR varied from 12% to 43% with a mean of 25.50%; and the decrease in SLRCP - SC varied from 24% to 51% with a mean of 34.75%. Crop coverage, plant height, root weight density, < 0.5 mm root length density (both at 0-5 cm depth), initial roughness, and initial crust thickness were significantly correlated with SLR. For cropped plot, SLRCP - estimated can achieve more accurate simulation result than conventional models obtained from literature findings, with RMSE (root mean square error) coefficient of 0.17. For a comprehensive understanding of the C-factor, multiple crops should be considered, and more experiments in the experimental group to better verify SLRCP - SSR - estimated and SLRCP - SC - estimated are recommended.

Over a period of 3 years, these restoration modes were applied, and their effects on soil enzyme activity, organic carbon, and nitrogen were critically analyzed. The results demonstrated that PRS was the most effective restoration method, enhancing soil water content, organic activity, and enzyme content the most, followed by OLRS and NRM, respectively. In the 0 similar to 60 cm soil layer, each restoration model was able to improve the vegetation characteristics, and the modification effects were PRS > ORRS > NRM > UMD in descending order. After the restoration, the summer surface temperature decreased from 41.3 degrees C to 23.1 degrees C. The average moisture content of the soil increased from 3.11% to 5.86%. The average moisture content of the soil increased from 3.11% to 5.86%, and the bulk density decreased from 1.47 g/m(3) to 1.40 g/m(3), resulting in a more rational soil structure. This research offers invaluable insights into the nutrient restoration mechanism of sandy lands, emphasizing the significant role of appropriate vegetation restoration measures in ecological restoration. The findings further suggest the potential application of the PRS model for optimal soil repair effects in similar ecological settings.						zhang, jun/0000-0002-7777-4245														2071-1050				OCT	2023	15	20							14730	10.3390/su152014730	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su152014730													WOS:001099450200001

Nitrification inhibitor (DMPP) can keep ammonium concentrations high in the soil for several weeks. Although there are contradictory reports regarding the priority of NH4+ uptake and its toxicity effects on wheat, it is necessary to understand better how to apply DMPP to increase drought tolerance without any negative effects. The field experiment was conducted using N-15 trace technology. The fertilizers treatment included ((NH4)-N-15)(2)SO4 and ((NH4)-N-15)(2)SO4 with DMPP at four drought stress levels. Available soil mineral nitrogen was measured, as well as yield components and N-15 recovery. The results showed that DMPP application at full irrigation and moderate drought stress caused an increase in grain yield of 13% and 10%, respectively. DMPP application at full irrigation, moderate and severe drought stress caused a significant increase in nitrogen use efficiency of 19%, 11%, and 17%, respectively. It seems DMPP application at the stem elongation stage, promoted NH4+ assimilation and transfer to the shoots, which has created relative resistance to drought stress conditions. In conclusion, it is recommended that farmers use DMPP at stem elongation to avoid wheat yield reduction and nitrogen recovery under drought stress.

The activated biosorbents were characterized using SEM, XRD and FTIR spectroscopy. Effects of particle size (0.063-1.0 mm), contact time (15-120 min), pH (2-12), dose (2-10 g), and initial concentration (0.5-5.0 mg/L) were investigated. The morphology analysis revealed that biosorbents showed the presence of a high binding capacity for fluoride adsorption. The maximum adsorption was attained; size of the adsorbent 0.063 mm, pH 7, contact time 60 min, and 6 g dose of the biosorbents. Moreover, the adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model and the adsorption isotherms fitted well to the Langmuir model. Furthermore, a field study was conducted using real water sample collected from Semema, Tigray, Ethiopia, and maximum fluoride removal was observed to be 79.44% and 77.05% for the activated carbons of Corncob and Sorghum husk at optimum conditions. Therefore, this experimental finding indicated that activated carbon of Corncob and Sorghum husk can be used as efficient, cheap, and eco-friendly biosorbents for the removal of fluoride from drinking water at community level.

Redundancy is thus defined as the fraction of species diversity not expressed by functional or phylogenetic diversity. We assessed functional and phylogenetic alpha- and betaredundancy in helminth and flea assemblages of two species of South African rodents, Rhabdomys dilectus and Rhabdomys pumilio, using community uniqueness as the inverse indicator of redundancy. We asked whether patterns of functional and phylogenetic alpha- and beta-uniqueness differed between (i) parasite groups (endo- versus ectoparasites), (ii) host species within parasite groups, and (iii) biomes within host species. We found differences between the two hosts in the functional and phylogenetic alphauniqueness (but not beta-uniqueness) of flea, but not helminth, assemblages. Significant correlations between the alpha-uniqueness of parasite assemblages and the total parasite prevalence were found only for phylogenetic uniqueness and only in helminths. Pairwise site-by-site dissimilarities in uniqueness (beta-uniqueness) and pairwise dissimilarity in prevalence were significantly associated (positively) in helminths but not in fleas. A between-biome difference in functional (but not phylogenetic) alphauniqueness was found in both helminth and flea assemblages harboured by R. pumilio. We conclude that the resilience of parasite assemblages in terms of the effect on hosts depends not only on their transmission strategy but also on traits of host species and environmental factors.

A Recombinant Inbred Line population was developed using accelerated-Single Seed Descent of progeny from a cross between two chickpea varieties, Rupali (salt-sensitive) and Genesis836 (salt-tolerant). The population was screened for salinity tolerance using high-throughput image-based phenotyping in the glasshouse, in hydroponics, and across 2 years of field trials at Merredin, Western Australia. A genetic map was constructed from 628 unique in-silico DArT and SNP markers, spanning 963.5 cM. Markers linked to two flowering loci identified on linkage groups CaLG03 and CaLG05 were used as cofactors during genetic analysis to remove the confounding effects of flowering on salinity response. Forty-two QTL were linked to growth rate, yield, and yield component traits under both control and saline conditions, and leaf tissue ion accumulation under salt stress. Residuals from regressions fitting best linear unbiased predictions from saline conditions onto best linear unbiased predictions from control conditions provided a measure of salinity tolerance per se, independent of yield potential. Six QTL on CaLG04, CaLG05, and CaLG06 were associated with tolerance per se. In total, 21 QTL mapped to two distinct regions on CaLG04. The first distinct region controlled the number of filled pods, leaf necrosis, seed number, and seed yield specifically under salinity, and co-located with four QTL linked to salt tolerance per se. The second distinct region controlled 100-seed weight and growth-related traits, independent of salinity treatment. Positional cloning of the salinity tolerance-specific loci on CaLG04, CaLG05, and CaLG06 will improve our understanding of the key determinants of salinity tolerance in chickpea.

It has been widely demonstrated that plant diversity plays a crucial role in enhancing the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. However, few studies have tested the influence of plant species richness in mediating the impacts of climate on ecosystem functions at large spatial scales.To address this gap, we utilized data from field surveys across broad climatic gradients at the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. Our goal was to examine the importance of plant species richness for the functioning of alpine grassland ecosystems, specifically productivity and soil carbon sequestration.Our results showed strong positive correlations between ecosystem functioning and growing season precipitation as well as species richness. In contrast, there was a negative correlation with growing season temperature. Notably, the positive effect of growing season precipitation on ecosystem functioning outweighed the negative effect of growing season temperature. The indirect effects of growing season precipitation and temperature on ecosystem functioning through changes in species richness were weak. Furthermore, the inclusion of climate factors in the model weakened the relationships between species richness and ecosystem functioning.Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that climate factors are more important than species richness for the provisioning of ecosystem functions at large spatial scales. In summary, our study underscores the importance of considering climate factors alongside species richness when assessing ecosystem functioning across extensive geographical areas.

J	He, QL; Li, BB; Zhang, FB; Shen, N; Yang, MY				He, Qilin; Li, Binbin; Zhang, Fengbao; Shen, Nan; Yang, Mingyi			Optimal clipping intensity for balancing soil erosion control and runoff production on revegetated slopes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Clipping management by reducing the above-ground parts of grassland has been gradually introduced to offset some of the additional issues caused by large-scale vegetation restoration, such as the formation of a dry soil layer, approaching the limits of watershed water resources, and reducing the sustainability of vegetation. Therefore, there is a scientific and practical need to evaluate the effectiveness of clipping management on runoff and erosion processes to ensure a balance between erosion control, surface water supply, and vegetation sus-tainability. In this study, simulated rainfall experiments with four levels of clipping intensities (no clipping, light clipping, heavy clipping, and clear clipping) were conducted to explore the mechanism of runoff and soil loss response under three rainfall intensities (i.e., 60, 90, and 120 mm center dot h-1) and three slope gradients (i.e., 18, 36, and 58 %) using structural equation modeling and variation partitioning. The results showed that the runoff depth increased by 42 %, 119 %, and 299 %, respectively, and the soil loss increased by 76 %, 80 %, and 470 %, respectively, in the light, heavy, and clear clipping treatments compared with the no clipping treatment, indi-cating that the increase in the percentage of runoff production and soil loss was not synchronized. According to the optimizing results of response surface method, the recommended vegetation cover after clipping was 23 % -48 %, and the slope gradient of clipped vegetation should not exceed 36 %, which increased surface runoff while limiting soil erosion within an acceptable range. Runoff production and soil loss were primarily determined by rainfall intensity, followed by clipping intensity and slope gradient. Increasing rainfall intensity and slope gradient increased the effect of clipping on soil loss. Therefore, local rainfall and topography need to be considered in the application of clipping management. This study provides valuable insights into the use of clipping treatment as a sustainable management strategy for mitigating soil erosion and conserving surface water resources, and has important implications for developing restoration plans to promote sustainability in semi-arid ecosystems.						yang, ming yi/0000-0003-4706-0708; Zhang, Fengbao/0000-0003-1003-256X													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2023	620		A						129470	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129470	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129470		APR 2023											WOS:000976926600001

In this study, the spatial changes of soil moisture, nutrients, and roots under different tillage modes, as well as the efficient utilization mechanism of soil moisture and nutrients from rain-fed maize on three mulching treatments (no surface covering, ridge film and straw mulch and ridge film mulch) and two slope treatments (5 degrees slope and 10 degrees slope) of sloping farmlands were studied at the Nationally Agricultural Environment Fuxin Observation and Experiment Station in China through a micro-zone simulation and a long-term positioning experiment. The results indicated that ridge film mulch and furrow seeding significantly improve the water use efficiency and partial factor productivity of the plants in sloping farmlands, with the highest increases being 51.33% and 45.05%. By analyzing the coordinated relationship between water, nutrients, and roots, it was found that ridge film furrow seeding technology can significantly affect the spatial distribution of water, nutrients, and roots in different soil layers, and improves the effective coefficient of soil water and nutrients. The effective coefficient of ridge film and straw treatment was 2.53, while the average value of the effective coefficient of ridge film treatment was 1.39. Further analysis found that the degree of consistency between the root system, water, and nutrient barycenter was highly correlated with the effective coefficients of water and nutrients. Visual radar map analysis revealed that root development limits the improvement availability of the efficient use of water and nutrients in the soil. Promoting root development indicators and root spatial distribution through ridge film coverage was an effective way to improve the efficient use of maize water and nutrients. The ridge film mulching promoted the root development index and root spatial distribution, thus improving the efficient use of water and nutrients in maize. Overall, the ranking of the regulation effect was as follows: ridge film and straw mulch > ridge film mulch > no mulch, and 5 degrees slope > 10 degrees slope. This research provided a theoretical basis for the enhancement of use efficiency in water and nutrients in sloping farmlands.																				2077-0472				OCT	2023	13	10							1940	10.3390/agriculture13101940	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13101940													WOS:001094918600001

However, the effects of different biochar application rates on soil organic C content and its fractions in the Loess Plateau of northwest China are still unclear. In this work, six biochar treatments were studied, with application rates of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 t.ha(-1) (CK, T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5, respectively). Soil total organic C (TOC), readily oxidizable C (ROC), water-soluble organic C (WSOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), light fraction organic C (LFOC), heavy fraction organic C (HFOC) and the Carbon pool management index (CPMI) in the 0-30 cm layer were analyzed after 3 years of wheat field trials. The content of soil TOC and its fractions decreased with soil depth but was significantly (p < .05) increased by biochar. TOC, ROC and HFOC showed significant (p < .05) positive correlations with the rate of biochar application, with the highest content of these components in T5. MBC, WSOC and LFOC first increased and then decreased with the increasing rate of biochar application. MBC and WSOC of T3 and LFOC of T4 were the highest of all treatments. When compared with CK, the CPMI of all biochar treatments was >100% in the order of T5 > T4 > T3 > T2 > T1. This study provides scientific support for large-scale biochar application on the Loess Plateau to significantly improve soil quality via increasing the soil organic C fractions and enhancing the inert soil C pool.																			0010-3624	1532-2416				MAR 9	2021	52	5					423	431		10.1080/00103624.2020.1845357	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2020.1845357		DEC 2020											WOS:000607420700001

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the GLC on the surface runoff and peak flow rates of watershed on the Loess Plateau under different rainfall events and hydrological years. A GIS-based Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) model was used. The results showed that GLC reduced the mean event surface runoff by 6.2-24.7%, and the reducing efficiency was the highest under light rain events. GLC also decreased annual surface runoff, and the reducing efficiency was 12.04% (normal year) > 7.63% (wet year) > 4.45% (dry year). In addition, GLC decreased the peak flow rate of the watershed by 8.1-30.2% and prolonged the time to peak flow rate. The efficiency of GLC in reducing the peak flow rate was higher under light rain events than that under extraordinary storm events. The reason for the decrease in runoff and peak flow rate after GLC was that the GLC decreased the slope gradient and hydrological connectivity of the watershed. The results will provide guidance for the application of GLC on the Loess Plateau and watershed management for similar regions.																				2073-4441				AUG	2022	14	16							2582	10.3390/w14162582	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14162582													WOS:000845284600001

Gypsum, langbeinite, sulfur, and compost for reclamation of drastically disturbed calcareous saline-sodic soils	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Soil disturbance during arid region energy development often redistributes subsurface salts, including sodium (Na), to the surface. Elevated Na degrades soil structure and inhibits germination and establishment of native plants important for ecosystem functions. Strategies for rapid reclamation of thin surface horizons are needed. Study objectives were to evaluate chemical amendments and compost for remediation of saline-sodic soils on a well pad that had electrical conductivity (EC) of 8.7dSm(-1) and exchangeable sodium percentage of 38.6% following reclamation practices in south-central Wyoming. Eight treatments applied in October 2012 included gypsum, langbeinite, and elemental sulfur (S) with and without compost, plus compost alone, and an untreated control. Plots were sampled four times over 1year at depths of 0-3, 3-8, and 8-15cm. Samples were analyzed for exchangeable plus solution concentrations of Na, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K). Results indicate that Na was leached from surface soils in all the treatments and the untreated control. Langbeinite most effectively enhanced movement of Na and caused initial increases in salinity that abated within 1year. Gypsum enhanced movement of Na to lesser degree, and movement under S and compost was equivalent to untreated controls. Added compost did not affect activity of langbeinite, gypsum, or S. Langbeinite effectively reduced sodicity, but high cost and initial increases in soil salinity warrant additional investigation of appropriate application rates and alternative management practices, such as delaying planting until high-salinity abates.

The thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries in some regions has doubled over the past 20 years. However, no study is available about the effects of alpine gravelization on alpine meadow ecosystem. Here, by investigating and measuring the community characteristics, soil moisture, and soil temperature of alpine meadows under three different gravel coverage levels (No gravel covered meadow, half gravel covered meadow, and fully gravel covered meadow), we examine the response of surface microhabitats and community to gravel cover on a typical hillside alpine meadow. Results showed that gravel cover significantly decreased soil/gravel ratio and topsoil moisture. Topsoil water content of the half-covered and the fully-covered gravel meadow was outstandingly low and reached<8% and 5%, respectively. Meanwhile, the larger decrease rates for coverage (-72.53%), above-and below-ground biomass (-76.61% and-94.09%), community density (-81.76%), species richness (-77.75%) and diversity (-55.98%) were found after gravel cover. Gravel cover induced the changes of the dominant species composition from Kobresia pygmaea to Setaria viridis, and ultimately to Trigonotis peduncularis and Ranunculus pedatifidus. Cyperaceae functional group species almost disappeared with increasing gravel coverage. In general, the increase in gravel coverage caused a decrease in soil water content, coverage, above-ground and under-ground biomass, community density, species richness, and the disappearance of Cyperaceae functional group species. Our results provide a new insight into the effect of alpine gravelization on soil water environment and alpine meadow degradation.

We studied patterns of changes in host-flea interactions measured as total turnover (TT) which can be partitioned into components, namely species turnover (ST), interaction rewiring (RW), and mixed turnover (MX) in networks from Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, applying a multi-site interaction turnover metric. We also searched for environmental drivers of TT and its components. 2. We asked whether (a) different components contribute differently to TT in rare versus common interactions (in terms of frequency of interaction occurrence); (b) relative roles of turnover components for rare and common interactions differ between continents; and (c) the environmental drivers of interaction turnover differ between turnover components, rare and common interactions, and/or continental networks. 3. Between-network dissimilarity of interactions increased with an increase in the number of compared networks. Pure ST contributed the most to the turnover of rare interactions, whereas the turnover of common interactions was predominated by MX. 4. The effects of environmental factors, interaction richness, and spatial distance on TT and its components differed between continental networks, turnover components, and rare versus common interactions. Climate and vegetation exerted the strongest effects on (a) ST for rare (except Asia) and, to a lesser degree, common (South America) interactions, (b) RW for both rare and common interactions in Europe/Asia, and (c) MX for both rare and common interactions (except Africa). Interaction richness and spatial distance mainly influenced ST. 5. We conclude that the patterns of interaction turnover and its components were geographically invariant and did not depend on the identity of the interactors, whereas the drivers of the turnover differed between continental networks because of species-specific responses to the environment.

Upslope sediment-laden flow impacts on ephemeral gully erosion: Evidences from field monitoring and laboratory simulation	CATENA												Ephemeral gully (EG) is an important linear erosion feature, often occurring at mid-slope position, that can be greatly influenced by upslope inflow and its sediment transport capacity. How sediment concentration in upslope inflow influences downslope EG erosion is still unclear. Thus, field monitoring on a natural hillslope and indoor simulations on a dual-box system were conducted to better understand their relationship. The results showed that both field monitoring and indoor simulation displayed the additional sediment delivery caused by upslope sediment-laden flow, verifying the transport-dominated sediment regime in EG systems. In field observations, the sediment increment coefficient (SIC, ratio of net sediment delivery caused by upslope sediment-laden flow to the total sediment delivery) on an event scale varied from 4.6% to 88.6%. In indoor simulations, the SIC changed from 24.9% to 87.5%. Indoor simulation experiments with a range of 0-378.2 g L-1 sediment concentration supplied by a feeder box, showed that SIC linearly decreased as sediment concentration of upslope inflow increased. Field monitoring showed complicated phenomenon because of natural random variations. For rainfall events with PI30 (the product of precipitation and maximum 30-minute rainfall intensity) larger than 400 mm(2) h(-1) (similar to the designed extreme rainfall in laboratory simulations), SIC also generally decreased as sediment concentration of upslope inflow increased, especially when sediment concentration of upslope inflow was smaller than 400 gL(-1). Thus, laboratory simulations verified the field monitoring results of extreme rainfall events with large rainfall amounts and intensities. This study illustrated the necessity of in-situ field monitoring and indicated that design of indoor simulation experiments needs more comprehensive considerations on complicated hydrological and sediment conditions.

Uncertainty of CERES-Maize Calibration under Different Irrigation Strategies Using PEST Optimization Algorithm	AGRONOMY-BASEL												An important but rarely studied aspect of crop modeling is the uncertainty associated with model calibration and its effect on model prediction. Biomass and grain yield data from a four-year maize experiment (2008-2011) with six irrigation treatments were divided into subsets by either treatments (Calibration-by-Treatment) or years (Calibration-by-Year). These subsets were then used to calibrate crop cultivar parameters in CERES (Crop Environment Resource Synthesis)-Maize implemented within RZWQM2 (Root Zone Water Quality Model 2) using the automatic Parameter ESTimation (PEST) algorithm to explore model calibration uncertainties. After calibration for each subset, PEST also generated 300 cultivar parameter sets by assuming a normal distribution of each parameter within their reported values in the literature, using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method. The parameter sets that produced similar goodness of fit (11-164 depending on subset used for calibration) were then used to predict all the treatments and years of the entire dataset. Our results showed that the selection of calibration datasets greatly affected the calibrated crop parameters and their uncertainty, as well as prediction uncertainty of grain yield and biomass. The high variability in model prediction of grain yield and biomass among the six (Calibration-by-Treatment) or the four (Calibration-by-Year) scenarios indicated that parameter uncertainty should be considered in calibrating CERES-Maize with grain yield and biomass data from different irrigation treatments, and model predictions should be provided with confidence intervals.

In this study, event-based extreme precipitation (EEP) was defined as continuous precipitation that includes at least one day of EP. We analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of four EEP types (front EEP, late EEP, balanced EEP, and single day EEP) across the Loess Plateau (LP) based on data acquired from 87 meteorological stations from 1960 to 2019. Precipitation on the LP basically maintained a spatial pattern of "low in the northwest region and high in the southeast region", and EP over the last 10 a increased significantly. The cumulative precipitation percentage of single day EEP was 34% and was dominant for 60 a, while the cumulative precipitation percentage of front, late, and balanced EEP types associated with PSP accounted for 66%, which confirms to the connotation of EEP. The cumulative frequencies of front and late EEP types were 23% and 21%, respectively, while the cumulative frequency of balanced EEP had the lowest value at only 13%. Moreover, global warming could lead to more single day EEP across the LP, and continuous EEP could increase in the northwestern region and decrease in the eastern region in the future. The concept of process-oriented EP could facilitate further exploration of disaster-causing processes associated with different types of EP, and provide a theoretical basis for deriving precipitation disaster chains and construction of disaster cluster characteristics.

However, the response of soil carbon release (RS) at various depths to these events and associated regulatory processes has not been well-documented in small watersheds. We measured the mean CO2 concentration, soil moisture (SM), and soil temperature (ST) at depths of 10, 50, and 100 cm in situ before and after extreme rainfall events between June and September 2019, in a typical small watershed of the Loess Hilly Region, China. RS, calculated using Fick's first law in one dimension, revealed the relationships between RS and extreme rainfall events. During the study period, we screened four extreme rainfall events, of which three were used. The mean RS at 10, 50, and 100 cm soil depths after extreme rainfall (post-RS) were significantly higher than those before (pro-RS) (P < 0.05). Simultaneously, decreased ST at a depth of 10 cm and increased SM at a depth of 10 cm during periods of extreme rainfall contributed to decreased RS at a depth of 10 cm. By contrast, the RS at depths of 50 and 100 cm were enhanced during periods of extreme rainfall and peaked between days two and four after the extreme rainfall events due to the significant stimulating increase in SM (P < 0.05); the relative change in RS at 50 cm soil depth was the largest. Moreover, the RS values at three soil depths were changed by extreme rainfall events (with higher SM to RS), yet the R2 of the ST was lower after extreme rainfall. In addition, after extreme rainfall, the temperature sensitivity (Q10) increased at a depth of 10 cm, while it decreased at depths of 50 and 100 cm. These findings imply that more CO2 is released from deep soil in semi-arid shrubs under extreme rainfall events with sustained increase for 2-4 days. The results will help predict the impact of future climate change on regional carbon emissions and improve the accuracy of predictive model.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				JAN	2023	220		A						106652	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106652	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106652		OCT 2022											WOS:000874681000003
J	Xiao, L; Liu, GB; Li, P; Xue, S				Xiao, Lie; Liu, Guobin; Li, Peng; Xue, Sha			Ecological stoichiometry of plant-soil-enzyme interactions drives secondary plant succession in the abandoned grasslands of Loess Plateau, China	CATENA												Ecological stoichiometry is the study of the interaction and balance of multiple chemical elements in ecological processes. However, how ecological stoichiometric interactions among plants, soils, and enzymes in the rhizosphere affect secondary plant succession is largely unknown. In this study, we collected the dominant and main companion species Artemisia capillaris, A. sacrorum, and Stipa bungeana, along a secondary succession chronosequence (7, 12, 17, 22, and 32-year) following a cropland abandonment in the Loess Plateau, China. We measured the carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations of plant shoots and roots, as well as the concentrations of C, N, P, available N (aN), available P (aP), and the activity of one C-acquiring enzyme (beta-glucosidase (BG)), two N-acquiring enzymes (N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), leucineaminopeptidase (LAP)), and one P-acquiring enzyme (alkaline phosphatase (AP)) found in the rhizospheric soil to explore the C:N:P stoichiometry that drives secondary plant succession. The C:P and N:P ratios in the shoots of dominant plant species significantly decreased to a minimum value at the 22-year site and then increased with plant secondary succession. Compared with the 7-year site, the rhizosphere soil C:P and N:P ratios, and enzyme N:P ratios (ln (NAG + LAP):ln(AP)) increased 103.6%, 72.0%, and 221.3%, respectively, but enzyme C:N ratios (ln(BG):ln (NAG + LAP)) decreased 48.2% in the dominant plant species at the 32-year site. Principal component analysis indicated that the stoichiometry characteristics of the plant-soil-enzyme continuum differed for each plant species and succession stage. Stoichiometric homeostasis indices for the plant species indicated a relatively strong homeostasis, while redundancy analysis revealed that the variations in soil BG, NAG, and AP activity and enzyme C:N ratio had significant effects on the stoichiometries and nutrient concentrations of the plant tissues. The results indicated that rhizosphere stoichiometry is a powerful tool for evaluating plant-soil interactions in terrestrial ecosystems and that the variation in rhizospheric soil enzyme activity driving the secondary succession of plants.

Based on the Gini coefficient model and the matching index, the amount of the total renewable water resources and the cultivated land area were introduced to evaluate the matching pattern between the water and land resources in Central Asia. The water problem of Kazakhstan, being the most prominent, shows low water resources per unit area with the highest reclamation rate. The matching degree for the upstream countries of the Aral Sea (Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan) was better than those of the downstream countries (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan). The Gini coefficient in Central Asia was 0.32, smaller than that of the global average value (0.59). The overall water available for use and the matching cultivated land resources was reasonable. Large differences exist in the matching degree in water distribution and utilization among Central Asian countries. The matching index of water and land resources in Central Asia was 1.25, similar to the matching degree estimated from the Gini coefficient model. Moreover, rational measures are suggested to alleviate the issue of water and land resources matching in Central Asia.

However, the relative importance of plant- and microbially-derived C for SOC is still an open question for temperate grasslands. Here, amino sugars and lignin phenols were used as biomarkers to investigate the relative microbial and plant residue contribution to SOC in a 30-year (1-, 5-, 10-, 15-, 25-, 30-year) restoration chronosequence of temperate grassland. The contribution of microbially-derived C (from 4.9 to 13 g kg(-1)) to SOC was much greater than that of plant-derived C (from 1.3 to 2.3 g kg(-1)). At the early stage of restoration (<15 years), grassland soils accumulated more C in the form of plant-derived C. In contrast, grassland soils at the late stage of restoration (>15 years) accumulated more microbially-derived C, and less from plant residues. These findings highlight the dominance of microbial contribution to SOC stabilization compared with plant residues. The contribution of bacteria-derived C to SOC gradually increased from 29% to 50% with progress of grassland restoration, while the contribution of fungal C to SOC decreased from 30% to 21%. Consequently, microbial residue contribution to SOC shifts from fungal and bacterial to mainly bacterial residues during grassland restoration. This shift may be due to the faster bacterial growth and a increasing living biomass during grassland restoration, leading to higher accumulation of bacterial residues. Correlation analysis and random forest models showed that belowground plant biomass, soil pH, and living microbial biomass were the main factors regulating plant-derived C. The microbially-derived C in SOC, however, was dependent on living microbial biomass, soil pH and dissolved organic C. Concluding, grassland restoration increased soil C sequestration primarily by microbial necromass (mainly bacterial necromass), and is affected by abiotic and biotic factors, as well as plant C input.

Given their functional significance, it is important to understand their responses to human-induced global changes, such as climate change and land-use intensification. Here, we utilized an experimental field study, to test the interactive effects of climate (ambient vs. future) and land use (five land-use regimes, from extensively-used meadow to conventional farming) on three eco-morphological life forms of Collembola: epedaphic, hemiedaphic, and euedaphic species. We found that the effects of climate change on Collembola density were modulated by land use, and that the responses of different life forms to climate x land use interaction differed in magnitude and/or direction. The densities of total and hemiedaphic Collembola significantly decreased under organic farming and marginally increased in grasslands under future climatic conditions, whereas epedaphic Collembola tended to decrease their density with climate change in grasslands. In contrast, the density of euedaphic Collembola significantly increased with climate change in intensively-used grasslands. Further, we found that grasslands (especially extensively-used meadow) support the most abundant Collembola communities, with high species richness but low evenness. Multivariate analyses revealed independent effects of climate change and land-use intensification on Collembola community composition. Together, our findings indicate that the effects of climate change on Collembola communities depend on their life forms and land-use types. Surface-dwelling Collembola are more vulnerable to land use and climate change than those living in deeper soil layers. This may slow down the process of soil-surface litter decomposition in a changing world.					Gruss, Iwona Anna I.

The realization of sustainability of eco-environments has long been a key issue. Consequently, we analysed the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) to identify solutions to the sustainable development of such regions. We first reviewed the eco-environmental changes in the CLP and discussed the impacts of human activities over the past 3000 years, and then summarized previous experiences on the protection and restoration of degraded eco-environments. Our study indicates that the increasing demand for cultivated land has led to the destruction of vegetation and subsequent worsening of soil erosion on the CLP, which in turn, has led to an increase in floods in the Yellow River basin. However, many positive measures, such as slope cropland abandonment and afforestation have been demonstrated to be effective in improving the eco-environment via reducing soil erosion, and decreasing sediment input and flood disasters in the Yellow River in recent decades. Nonetheless, emerging problems such as water shortage, food insecurity, rapid urban development, and over-exploitation of energy resources hinder the sustainable development of the eco-environment in the CLP. Given the historical and present eco-environmental situations of the CLP, we provide suggestions for the sustainable development of both the eco-environment and social economy, which could serve as guidelines for eco-environmental design and government policy-making in semi-arid regions globally.

However, the factors determining oxytocin concentrations during and after pregnancy such as medical history related to nursing or parental behavior are unknown. To elucidate these, we analyzed the relationships between oxytocin concentrations during and after pregnancy, and medical history assessed in the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS). Methods We then selected the pregnant women with a medical history of anxiety disorder and endometriosis as cases and pregnant women without medical history as controls adjusting the cohort for age and parity for a nested case-control study, after which 162 women remained for analysis. We evaluated 162 pregnant women from JECS using answers provided in a questionnaire and by measuring plasma oxytocin concentration by ELISA during the first (T1) and second (T2) trimesters of pregnancy, and after childbirth (T3). Results Oxytocin concentration increased in a time dependent manner, consistent with previous reports. There were weak negative correlations between oxytocin concentration at T1 and the mother's age and height, but no correlation with other factors. The mean oxytocin concentrations of pregnant women with a history of an anxiety disorder (n = 7) and endometriosis (n = 13) were significantly lower than those of pregnant women with no such history at T2 and T3. Conclusion These results suggest that oxytocin concentrations during and after pregnancy were affected by a past history of anxiety disorder and endometriosis.

This study evaluated the high-yielding and promising maize genotypes over years and locations by the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model. The grain yield of 13 spring maize genotypes was evaluated for two consecutive years (2012-2013) when planted in six and eight ecological environments, respectively, using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The AMMI model explained 77.49 and 75.57% of total observed genotypic variation, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of variances showed a highly significant impact of environment, genotype and genotype x environment (GE) interaction on grain yield (P < 0.01). The AMMI model analysis of variance showed that the environment contributed the most to variations in grain yield (55.58 and 72.50% of the total variation, respectively), followed by GE interaction (24.61 and 10.71% of the total variation, respectively) and genotype (3.01 and 3.01% of the total variation, respectively). Among the interaction effects, first interaction principal component axis (IPCA1), IPCA2 and IPCA3 explained the vast majority of genetic and environmental interaction information. Two years of experimental data showed that the genotype with high yield and stability was G4 (Zhongdi175) while G3 (C807) and G8 (LY10) of poor yield and unstable. The check genotype G6 (Nongda108) had good stability and general high-yielding. The best and worst discriminative environments for each of the locations in 2012-2013 were XT (Xingtai) and LH (Longhua), WA (Wuan) and PQ (Pingquan), respectively.

However, it is still not well-known how soil microbiomes and their functionality respond to fertilization in various cropping systems. Here we examined the effects of 36 years of phosphorus, nitrogen, and manure application on soil bacterial communities, functionality and crop productivity in three contrasting cropping systems (i.e., continuous leguminous alfalfa (AC), continuous winter wheat (WC), and grain-legume rotation of winter wheat + millet - pea - winter wheat (GLR)) in a highland region of China's Loess Plateau. We showed that long-term fertilization significantly affected soil bacterial communities and that the effects varied with cropping system. Compared with the unfertilized control, fertilization increased soil bacterial richness and diversity in the leguminous AC system, whereas it decreased those in the GLR system. Fertilization, particularly manure application, enlarged the differences in soil bacterial communities among cropping systems. Soil bacterial communities were mostly affected by the soil organic carbon and nitrogen contents in the WC and GLR systems, but by the soil available phosphorous content in the AC system. Crop productivity was closely associated with the abundance of fertilization-responsive taxa in the three cropping systems. Our study highlights that legume and non-legume cropping systems should be disentangled when assessing the responses of soil microbial communities to long-term fertilizer application.

The potential to expand lucerne beyond its current cultivated areas in New Zealand, and its potential productivity across the country's contrasting climate zones, are currently un-known. To gain such insights, we estimated land suitability and spatial distribution of lucerne above-ground biomass across New Zealand lands considering contrasting growth conditions (rain-fed or irrigated for different soils types) and two simulation methods of different complexity (process-and GIS-based approaches). This aimed to assess yield-estimate spatial patterns and sensitivity to model selection for a wide range of com-binations of water supply (i.e. irrigation and soil water storage) across New Zealand climate zones. For example, highly suitable areas for lucerne cultivation, were estimated in-21 thousand km2 when considering the exclusion of steep slopes, poor soil drainage and excess annual rainfall. The two crop-yield models were applied in response to 30 years of daily historical (1971-2000) weather data downscaled at 5 km resolution on suitable areas. Simulated average lucerne yields ranged from -4.5-28 t dry matter/ha per year. Simulations showed a distinct spatial pattern of yield decline from north to south, mainly in response to decreasing temperatures. Temporally, water limited yields were up to 4-fold more variable than under irrigation, depending on the degree of drought stress across different years. Results also unveiled systematic spatial patterns of model uncertainty quantified as yield sensitivity to model selection. For instance, simulated yields were most sensitive to model selection (6-31% of total variability, Ti) within high abiotic-stress environments (e.g. low temperature and limited water supply). Overall, soil type selection accounted for most of yield variability (58-78% Ti), being particularly important in warmer environments with variable seasonal rainfall regimes (e.g. northern regions). As expected, water supply (i.e. rain-fed or irrigated systems) was relatively more impactful on yield (8-20% Ti) for limited rainfall areas, where crops are most drought prone (e.g. east coast and central southern regions). Long-term regional scale comparisons of annual lucerne yield, between 30-year simulated distributions and point-based observations from the AgYields database, helped identify hotspots of yield overestimation. Such insights are useful to guide future research on high yield gap areas (e.g. southern colder and drier locations) and highlight key areas for model improvement (e.g. representation of multiple biotic stresses). Overall, our results provide a first gridded-model assessment of lucerne suitability and yield at national scale and quantify the share of variability explained by key climatic, management and methodological components in spatial analysis studies. These insights can inform future modelling efforts and support agricultural planning that considers the expansion of lucerne and other perennial legumes.

In the present study, population structure, and genetic relationships among 144 accessions of barley landraces and breeding materials from various countries were studied using a set of 77 and 72 EST-SSR and gSSR markers, respectively distributed on seven chromosomes of barley. In total, 262 and 429 alleles were amplified in 77 EST-SSRs and 72 gSSR loci, respectively. Out of which, 185 private/group-specific alleles were identified in the landraces compared with 14 in "cultivar and advanced breeding lines", indicating the possibility to introgress favorite alleles from landraces into breeding materials. Comparative analysis of genetic variation among breeding materials, Iranian landraces, and exotic landraces revealed higher genetic diversity in Iranian landraces compared with others. A total of 37, 15, and 14 private/group-specific alleles were identified in Iranian landraces, exotic landraces, and breeding materials, respectively. The most likely groups for 144 barley genotypes were three as inferred using model- and distance-based clustering as well as principal coordinate analysis which assigned the landraces and breeding materials into separate groups. The distribution of alleles was found to be correlated with population structure, domestication history and eco-geographical factors. The high allelic richness in the studied set of barley genotype provides insights into the available diversity and allows the construction of core groups based on maximizing allelic diversity for use in barley breeding programs.

Evaluation of APEX modifications to simulate forage production for grazing management decision-support in the Western US Great Plains	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												Context: Understanding how grazing management decisions influence the productivity and composition of rangeland plant communities is essential for the development of effective strategies to sustainably produce multiple ecosystem goods and services. Informed with experimental measurements, simulation models can advance our understanding and stewardship of rangeland ecosystems. Objective: Our main objective was to evaluate the APEX (Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender) plant growth modules and grazing animal selectivity in simulating forage production using experimental data collected from both traditional season-long grazing and adaptive rotational grazing management on western rangelands. Specifically, we evaluated APEX's capability to simulate forage productivity and its response to soil types and climate conditions under grazing management options. Methods: Capitalizing on a comparative field study with 20 large pastures (> 123 ha each), APEX modifications were evaluated by comparing simulated forage production with experimental data. The field study evaluated traditional grazing (season long grazing on a single pasture) and an alternative grazing system that utilized collaborative adaptive rangeland management with stakeholders engaged in decision making (such as when and where to rotate a single herd). APEX was modified to include rotational grazing based on a user-defined sequence and automatic rotational grazing based on user-defined forage grazing limits and minimum/maximum grazing durations. Results and conclusions: The APEX model was able to simulate the relative differences in forage production between grazing treatments, across years, and among soil types; however, APEX underestimated forage production in 2015 and 2017 due to overestimating drought stress for the warm season perennial grass functional group. Simulation of grazing management scenarios showed that the collaborative adaptive management decision criteria resulted in grazing durations that produced more forage than consistent 7- or 14-day rotation intervals. Significance: These modifications were needed to capture the complexity of semiarid environments and thus enhance APEX to better assess grazing management decisions on forage production in regions such as the Western US Great Plains.

Leveraging observed soil heterotrophic respiration fluxes as a novel constraint on global-scale models	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Microbially explicit models may improve understanding and projections of carbon dynamics in response to future climate change, but their fidelity in simulating global-scale soil heterotrophic respiration (R-H), a stringent test for soil biogeochemical models, has never been evaluated. We used statistical global R-H products, as well as 7821 daily site-scale R-H measurements, to evaluate the spatiotemporal performance of one first-order decay model (CASA-CNP) and two microbially explicit biogeochemical models (CORPSE and MIMICS) that were forced by two different input datasets. CORPSE and MIMICS did not provide any measurable performance improvement; instead, the models were highly sensitive to the input data used to drive them. Spatial variability in R-H fluxes was generally well simulated except in the northern middle latitudes (similar to 50 degrees N) and arid regions; models captured the seasonal variability of R-H well, but showed more divergence in tropic and arctic regions. Our results demonstrate that the next generation of biogeochemical models shows promise but also needs to be improved for realistic spatiotemporal variability of R-H. Finally, we emphasize the importance of net primary production, soil moisture, and soil temperature inputs, and that jointly evaluating soil models for their spatial (global scale) and temporal (site scale) performance provides crucial benchmarks for improving biogeochemical models.

We asked whether these patterns in either fleas, hosts, or both 1) conform to a classical latitudinal gradient; 2) vary geographically; and 3) differ between fleas and hosts. We also asked whether the patterns of PD and FD follow those of SR. We collected data on the latitudinal distribution of 1022 flea and 900 mammal species from literature sources and calculated the SR, PD, and FD of both groups in 1 degrees latitude bands. Then, we used broken-stick regression models to analyse separately the latitudinal variation of 1) each diversity facet and 2) fleas and hosts in each geographic quadrant. The classical latitudinal gradient pattern was not found in either fleas or hosts across any facet of diversity or geographic quadrant, except for the PD of fleas in the southeastern quadrant and the FD of hosts in the southwestern quadrant. Latitudinal patterns of the SR, PD and FD of fleas and hosts differed substantially between geographic quadrants. Furthermore, the latitudinal distributions of flea and host SR were similar in three of four quadrants (except the northeastern quadrant), whereas the latitudinal distributions of flea and host PD were similar in the southwestern quadrant only. No similarity in flea versus host FD was revealed. The latitudinal patterns of flea and host PD and FD mostly did not follow those of their SR. We conclude that latitudinal gradients of species richness and phylogenetic and functional diversity appeared not to be universal phenomena. Instead, the latitudinal distributions of these diversity facets represent an interplay of ecological (current and past) and historical processes. For parasites, the processes acting on hosts add another layer of complexity underlying their latitudinal diversity patterns.					van der Mescht, Luther/J-8349-2019	van der Mescht, Luther/0000-0001-8813-9549; Vasilii, Grabovsky/0000-0002-7512-2470													0906-7590	1600-0587				2023 DEC 5	2023										10.1111/ecog.07129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.07129		DEC 2023											WOS:001112955200001

The soils were incubated with SM contents of 5%, 30%, and 45% and with wetting processes in the SM ranges from 5% to 30% (5-30%), from 5% to 30% to 45% (5-30-45%) and from 30% to 45% (30-45%); high-throughput sequencing and co-occurrence network analyses were applied to investigate the different responses of the bacterial and fungal communities to changed SM. Our results showed that bacteria were more sensitive than fungi to changes in SM. The dominant bacterial communities converted from Actinobacterial to Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria in 5-30-45% wetting procedure. Firmicutes preferred wet condition and exhibited slow resilience. However, no difference was observed for the Chloroflexi communities across any sample. The obvious difference in fungal composition was found between the wetting process of 5-30-45% and constant 45% SM. During the 5-30-45% procedure, the respiration rate was higher than that at 30-45% procedure after incubation for 24 days. The respiration rate in 5-30% procedure was lower than that of 5-30-45% process after incubation for 16-27 days. The larger effects on bacterial response than on fungi were verified in network analysis. Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that 84.40% of the variation in bacterial richness and diversity as well as fungal diversity can be explained by changes in soil respiration rate in response to wetting procedure. Understanding the response of difference between bacterial and fungal community composition, phylum-levels networks and respiration rate to changes in SM is essential for the management of plant-soil-water relationship in the ecosystem after natural vegetation restoration on the Loess Plateau.

J	Yogev, U; Barnes, A; Giladi, I; Gross, A				Yogev, Uri; Barnes, Adrian; Giladi, Itamar; Gross, Amit			Potential environmental impact resulting from biased fish sampling in intensive aquaculture operations	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Aquaculture contributes to global food security, producing over 70 million tons of fish and aquatic products annually. Protein rich fish feeds, together with labor costs are the most expensive component costs in aquaculture. Feed application is given as percent of fish weight and therefore, reliable biomass assessment is essential for profitable and environmentally sound aquaculture. Fish biomass estimates are typically based on sampling <2% of the fish population. The goals of this research were to estimate potential biases associated with fish sampling in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), and the potential economic and environmental implications of such biased estimations. The size of the biased sampling-based estimates of fish biomass in two cultured species was shown to be larger than what the confidence interval suggests, even after >20% of the population was sampled. Such biases, if indeed common, will most likely result in over/underfeeding, both entailing negative economic and environmental consequences. We advocate conducting similar studies with major cultured fish to generate "bias correction tables" for adjusting fish feeding rate to bias-corrected biomass. These will help reduce the potential economic losses and negative environmental impacts of aquaculture practice. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study investigated the effects of AM fungi on soil aggregate stability of Calcaric Regosol under well-watered and drought stress conditions. A two-compartment system was employed to exclude the effects of plant roots, and ultrasonic dispersion technique was applied to evaluate the aggregate bond energy. The results showed that good symbiotic relationships were formed between AM fungi and sandstorm-tolerant species Astragalus adsurgens Pall even under drought stress conditions. Inoculation with AM fungi significantly improved plant growth, especially the root development. Hyphal length, spore density, glomalin-related soil protein content were significantly increased by AM fungal inoculation under both well-watered and drought stress conditions. Likewise, the proportion and dispersive energy of soil water-stable macroaggregates were also markedly increased by the inoculation. The hyphae of AM fungi directly contributed to the dispersive energy of soil water-stable macro-aggregates and significantly improved soil aggregate stability under both experimental conditions. This study demonstrates that AM fungi play a dominant role in the stability of soil water-stable aggregates by improving the aggregate bond energy, particularly for macroaggregates.

We investigated this puzzle in a model system of Bartonella and rodents from Israel's northwestern Negev Desert. We chose to study this system because, in this region, 75-100% of rodents are infected with Bartonella at any given time, despite an efficient immunological response. In this region, Bartonella species circulate in three rodent species, and we tested the hypothesis that at least one of these hosts exhibits a waning immune response to Bartonella, which allows reinfections.Methods We inoculated captive animals of all three rodent species with the same Bartonella strain, and we quantified the bacterial dynamics and Bartonella-specific immunoglobulin G antibody kinetics over a period of 139 days after the primary inoculation, and then for 60 days following reinoculation with the same strain.Results Contrary to our hypothesis, we found a strong, long-lasting immunoglobulin G antibody response, with protective immunological memory in all three rodent species. That response prevented reinfection upon exposure of the rodents to the same Bartonella strain.Conclusions This study constitutes an initial step toward understanding how the interplay between traits of Bartonella and their hosts influences the epidemiological dynamics of these pathogens in nature.

Therefore, it is important to develop a simple and consistent system to study root traits in soybean. In this study, we adopted the semi-hydroponic system to investigate the variability in root morphological traits of 171 soybean genotypes popularized in the Yangtze and Huaihe River regions, eastern China. Highly diverse phenotypes were observed: shoot height (18.7-86.7 cm per plant with a median of 52.3 cm); total root length (208-1663 cm per plant with a median of 885 cm); and root mass (dry weight) (19.4-251 mg per plant with a median of 124 mg). Both total root length and root mass exhibited significant positive correlation with shoot mass (p <= 0.05), indicating their relationship with plant growth and adaptation strategies. The nine selected traits contributed to one of the two principal components (eigenvalues > 1), accounting for 78.9% of the total genotypic variation. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis separated the 171 genotypes into five major groups based on these root traits. Three selected genotypes with contrasting root systems were validated in soil-filled rhizoboxes (1.5 m deep) until maturity. Consistent ranking of the genotypes in some important root traits at various growth stages between the two experiments indicates the reliability of the semi-hydroponic system in phenotyping root trait variability at the early growth stage in soybean germplasms.

J	Shi, WH; Huang, MB				Shi, Wenhai; Huang, Mingbin			Predictions of soil and nutrient losses using a modified SWAT model in a large hilly-gully watershed of the Chinese Loess Plateau	INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Hydrological models are effective tools for assessing the effects of soil and nutrient losses on land degradation. SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model is widely used to simulate soil and nutrient losses caused by various management regimes. However, its performance of predicting nutrient loss has not been assessed adequately on the Loess Plateau. This study proposed a modified SWAT model by incorporating the modified Soil Conservation Service curve number method, the storm-based Chinese soil loss equation and the nutrient loss model. The observed daily data of runoff and sediment over 16 years and the monthly soluble phosphorus (P) and nitrate losses over 9 years and 4 years, respectively at the outlet of the upper Beiluo river (UBR) basin were used to assess the model performances. Global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of parameters to runoff, sediment, soluble P and nitrate in the modified SWAT were conducted. The findings during calibration and validation showed that the modified SWAT was highly accurate in terms of model efficiency (calibration: 0.83, 0.83, 0.48, and 0.49; validation: 0.58, 0.57, 0.53, and 0.65) for runoff, sediment, soluble P loss and nitrate loss, respectively. High model efficiency indicated that the modified SWAT could accurately predict soil and nutrient losses at the river basin scale for the Loess Plateau. Moreover, the temporal variations from month to year and the spatial variations at the sub-basin scale for soil loss and the total N and P losses were analysed using the data simulated by the modified SWAT. The results indicated that the critical loss period occurred in July and August, and the Grain for Green project significantly affected the hydrological behaviour and reduced the soil and nutrient losses in the UBR basin.

J	Gao, XF; Shi, XN; Lei, TW				Gao, Xiaofeng; Shi, Xiaonan; Lei, Tingwu			Influence of thawed soil depth on rainfall erosion of frozen bare meadow soil in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has a vast area of approximately 70x10(4) km(2) of alpine meadow under the impacts of soil freezing and thawing, thereby inducing intensive water erosion. Quantifying the rainfall erosion process of partially thawed soil provides the basis for model simulation of soil erosion on cold-region hillslopes. In this study, we conducted a laboratory experiment on rainfall-induced erosion of partially thawed soil slope under four slope gradients (5, 10, 15, and 20 degrees), three rainfall intensities (30, 60, and 90 mm h(-1)), and three thawed soil depths (1, 2, and 10 cm). The results indicated that shallow thawed soil depth aggravated soil erosion of partially thawed soil slopes under low hydrodynamic conditions (rainfall intensity of 30 mm h(-1) and slope gradient <= 15 degrees), whereas it inhibited erosion under high hydrodynamic conditions (rainfall intensity >= 60 mm h(-1) or slope gradient > 15 degrees). Soil erosion was controlled by the thawed soil depth and runoff hydrodynamic conditions. When the sediment supply was sufficient, the shallow thawed soil depth had a higher erosion potential and a larger sediment concentration. On the contrary, when the sediment supply was insufficient, the shallow thawed soil depth resulted in lower sediment erosion and a smaller sediment concentration. The hydrodynamic runoff conditions determined whether the sediment supply was sufficient. We propose a model to predict sediment delivery under different slope gradients, rainfall intensities, and thawed soil depths. The model, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.95, accurately predicted the sediment delivery under different conditions, which was helpful for quantification of the complex feedback of sediment delivery to the factors influencing rainfall erosion of partially thawed soil. This study provides valuable insights into the rainfall erosion mechanism of partially thawed soil slopes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and provides a basis for further studies on soil erosion under different hydrodynamic conditions.

Starch synthase (SS) is the key enzyme in plant starch synthesis, which plays an indispensable role in the conversion of pyrophosphoric acid to starch. However, the SS gene family in cotton has not been comprehensively identified and systematically analyzed. ResultIn our study, a total of 76 SS genes were identified from four cotton genomes and divided into five subfamilies through phylogenetic analysis. Genetic structure analysis proved that SS genes from the same subfamily had similar genetic structure and conserved sequences. A cis-element analysis of the SS gene promoter showed that it mainly contains light response elements, plant hormone response elements, and abiotic stress elements, which indicated that the SS gene played key roles not only in starch synthesis but also in abiotic stress response. Furthermore, we also conducted a gene interaction network for SS proteins. Silencing GhSS9 expression decreased the resistance of cotton to drought stress. These findings suggested that SS genes could be related to drought stress in cotton, which provided theoretical support for further research on the regulation mechanism of SS genes on abiotic starch synthesis and sugar levels.																			1664-462X					APR 5	2023	14								1163041	10.3389/fpls.2023.1163041	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1163041								37089638					WOS:000969853700001

These activities can further affect soil erosion processes. However, we have insufficient knowledge on the effects of earthworm activities on soil erosion. In this study, we quantified the effects of earthworm activities on soil water distribution, runoff rate, and soil erosion rate under three slope gradients (5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees) through a laboratory-simulated rainfall experiment. The uniform rainfall intensity (80 mm h(-1)) was set, and the rainfall duration after runoff generation was set to 60 min. Results showed that earthworm increased soil water infiltration and soil water storage (SWS). The increments in SWS were 41.2, 24.0, and 34.9 mm, respectively, in the tanks with earthworms at the slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees, which were 93%, 51%, and 70% higher than the values of the control plots (21.3, 15.9, and 20.5 mm). Compared with the control plots, earthworm activities reduced the runoff rate at slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees by 70%, 13%, and 39%, respectively; and increased soil erosion rate at slope gradients of 10 degrees and 15 degrees by 42% and 46%, respectively. Through their feeding, burrowing, and casting activities, earthworm increased soil water infiltration, reduced surface runoff, and increased soil erosion. This study provides insights into the effects of soil animals on soil erosion processes, and these data could then be incorporated into existing soil erosion simulation models or provide a basis for new models.

Dynamics of dissolved heavy metals in reservoir bays under different hydrological regulation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Reservoirs play a crucial role in the drinking water supply for solving the uneven distribution of water resources. Reservoir bays, which serve as direct source areas and initial collection areas of pollutants, are crucial areas for drinking water safety. Systematic observations of heavy metal pollution in reservoir bays are required and urgent under different hydrological regulation. Water samples were collected from 65 bays in the Danjiangkou Reservoir which is the water source of the world's longest trans-basin water diversion project during the storage and flood discharge period from 2015 to 2019. We investigated the temporal and spatial variation in eight dissolved heavy metals, chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb), and assessed their human health risks. The driving factors of high-risk metals were identified by constructing a structural equation model (SEM). The results showed that the concentrations of heavy metals decreased after 5 years of reservoir operation and varied significantly (p < 0.05) between the storage period and flood discharge period. The concentrations of Cr, Mn, Cd and Pb were higher in the storage period, but the other four metals (Ni, Cu, Zn, As) had the reverse trend. Notably, the As, Mn, and Pb in individual bays exceeded the water quality standard threshold. The human health risk assessment indicated that only As posed a potential carcinogenic risk (1.29E-04) in the flood discharge period. Land use and water physicochemical properties were the main factors affecting As concentrations, and they explained 32% and 44% of the variability of As in the storage and flood discharge periods, respectively. This study provided critical insights into the periodic dynamics and driving factors of the concentration of heavy metals in reservoir bays, and formulated effective management measures for water quality management.

Early Sweet is a direct consequence of high fruit set	HORTICULTURE RESEARCH												The 'seedless' table grape industry relies mainly on stenospermocarpic cultivars, in which endosperm abortion results in berries with seed rudiments and low levels of bioactive gibberellin (GA). Application of GA to enhance berry sizing in these cultivars is often accompanied by adverse effects, one of which is increased proportions of very small berries (termed shot berries). Manual removal of these berries, which is essential to improve uniformity and market value, increases production cost and exposes the cluster to damage. Unraveling the physiological causes of shot berry formation is thus of both scientific and practical value. This study focuses on understanding the GA-mediated regulation of shot berry formation in Vitis vinifera cv. Early Sweet, known for a high proportion of shot berries, which severely damage cluster appearance. As GA is known to induce the parthenocarpic fruit set, we first tested the assumption that the parthenocarpic nature of a fruitlet is a primary cause for shot berry development. We then examined the consequence of the flower load on the proportion of shot berries in the cluster. Our data suggests that: (1) contrary to prior assumptions, the parthenocarpic nature of a fruitlet is not the primary cause for shot berry development, demonstrated by the fact that parthenocarpic fruitlets develop into a full-size berries; (2) the proportion of shot berries on a cluster is a function of the initial flower load on the inflorescence, with high initial flower load resulting in greater shot berry percentage in the cluster; (3) GA treatment bypasses the natural regulation of flower load, resulting in high fruitlet density and increased competition among fruitlets; (4) variation of flower load within the cluster influences berry size uniformity to a greater extent than does the variation in number of cluster per vine. The identity of the factors that determine the fate of a given flower on a high-load cluster remains an open question.

We collected surface water, sediment, and various aquatic organisms from Lake Taihu, China. Several emerging PFASs, such as fluorotelomer sulfonates (FTSs), hexafluoropropylene oxides (HFPOs), and chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acids (Cl-PFESAs) were frequently detected in water and sediment samples. The concentrations of HFPO trimer acid (HFPO-TA), 4,8-dioxa-3 H-per-fluorononanoate, and FTSs were remarkably higher than those reported previously, indicating that their application is increasing in Taihu Basin. These emerging PFASs displayed higher sediment/water partitioning coefficients (log Koc) than the corresponding perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) with the same per -fluorinated carbon chain length. HFPOs and Cl-PFESAs were more labile to deposit in fish livers than perfluorooctanoic and perfluorooctane sulfonic acids, respectively. Both field investigations and model simula-tions indicated that HFPO-TA and Cl-PFESAs, as well as the hydrogen-substituted analogs of 6:2 Cl-PFESA (6:2 H-PFESA), were biomagnified along the aquatic food chain. The bioaccumulation model simulation revealed that the accumulation of these emerging PFASs in fish was mainly through dietary intake, whereas gill respiration and fecal excretion facilitated their elimination. Metabolic transformation might also contribute to their elimination relative to the legacy ones.

This study examined the effects of dominant perennial plants on nabkha formation. Five species (the shrub of Ephedra przewalskii and Calligonum zaidamense, the subshrub of Krascheninnikovia ceratoides and Sympegma regelii, the perennial herb of Artemisia desertorum) were selected. Length (Ln), width (Wn) and height (Hn) of nabkhas were used to represent nabkhas shape, the nabkha volume (Vn) was approximately estimated to represent sand intercepting capacity. Among the morphometric parameters of nabkhas and plants, Ln, Wn, Hn, Sn and Vn of the nabkhas showed less correlation with plant height (Hp), especially C. zaidamense, K. ceratoides and A. desertorum (r < 0.45). Ln, Wn, Hn, Sn and Vn of the nabkhas were significantly related to length (Lp), width (Wp), canopy area (Sp) and upwind profile (Sup) of the plant, especially E. przewalskii, C. zaidamense and S. regelii (r > 0.612). The sand intercepting capacity of the five plants was as follows: E. przewalskii > C. zaidamense > S. regelii > A. desertorum > K. ceratoides. The results indicate that E. przewalskii has large sand intercepting capacity. Moreover, the sand accumulation of C. zaidamense is greatly affected by the plant canopy in the early growth stage of the plant. Dwarf and highly branched semi-shrub S. regelii is beneficial to intercepting sand in unit canopy area and has big sand intercepting potential. A shelterbelt system combining fast-growing shrubs (C. zaidamense), shrubs (E. przewalskii) and semi-shrubs (S. regelii) in the windward direction is recommended for controlling aeolian erosion and improving the ecological environment in arid areas.

To understand how plants affect soil microbes, we compared soils under halophytic shrubs and herbs, whose effects on soil salinity (one of the strongest determining factors for soil microbes in saline grasslands) were different. We measured soil physicochemical properties, as well as prokaryotic abundance, community structure, diversity, and the quantified and predicted abundances of functional genes for nitrogen (N) cycling. As we intended, we found the soil salinity to be the highest in barren areas (BA), intermediate under a tamarisk crown (UC), and the lowest in herbaceous patches (HP), whereas other plant-related properties, e.g. soil organic matter content, differed between vegetated areas (UC and HP) and BA. Prokaryotic community structure and diversity changed along the soil salinity gradient, but not as a function of plant presence or absence. However, N transformation rate and N availability were not affected by the salinity gradient alone.

Allan			Presence frequency of plant species can predict spatial patterns of the species in small patches on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Patchiness is an important feature in grassland ecosystems, but the distribution pattern of plant species in small patches on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is largely unknown. We questioned: (1) whether the power law can be applied to determine the spatial pattern of plant species in small patches; and (2) how species frequency (dominant, companion and rare) affects the spatial heterogeneity of small patches on the QTP? The power law was used to examine the spatial pattern of plant species and examine the relationship between the plant species presence frequency and spatial pattern in three types of small patches (Cyperaceae, Polygonaceae and Compositae), each with three spatial extents according to the size of the area (scale 1: 0.6-0.9 m(2), scale 2: 3.0-3.8 m(2) and scale 3: 6.5-8.8 m(2)) on the QTP. Plant species in patches showed an aggregated distribution and the spatial heterogeneity index differed among species. The spatial heterogeneities of Cyperaceae and Polygonaceae patches were influenced strongly by dominant and companion plant species, while the Compositae patch was influenced by dominant and rare species. The Compositae patches exhibited a lower species diversity and higher spatial heterogeneity index than the other patches, and the extensive distribution of Compositae community can be linked to degradation processes in the alpine meadow. We concluded that the spatial pattern of plant species and the heterogeneity index for small patches could be determined by the species presence frequency on the QTP. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The SOC is commonly determined through soil sampling and subsequent labora-tory analysis using chemical methods. This method though very precise is time-consuming, labour-intensive and expensive. Contrarily, visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS) may be utilised to estimate SOC in a quick, labour-saving, and cost-effective manner. In this study, 72 soil samples were collected for SOC estimation and spectra collection. This current work proposes to investigate the use of PLSR scores in place of raw spectral reflectance to increase both the computation and model efficiency by reducing the number of input variables while retaining the maximum information present in the original data. With the existing indices, ratio and normalized difference indices were calculated in all possible combinations and were regressed to SOC content to identify the best-performing indices. Ten different multivariate models were evaluated for SOC estimation using full-spectrum and partial least squares regression (PLSR) scores. The results revealed that reflectance gradually increased with increasing soil depth and decreasing SOC. The prediction models developed using existing indices were observed to be poor in predicting the SOC with the R2 values ranging from 0.009 to 0.34. The best spectral indices for estimating SOC were RI (R1888, R2015) and NDI (R1888, R2015) with R2 of 0.60, 0.61 and 0.39, 0.43 for calibration and validation datasets, respectively. The PLSR score-based multivariate models outperformed solo multivariate and optimized index-based models. Our study suggested that VNIRS with PLSR combined multivariate models can reliably be used for fast and non-invasive estimation of SOC.

Compared to soil water content, plant-available soil water storage (ASWS) directly indicates the amount of soil water that can be used by plants. Understanding the spatial characteristics and controlling factors of ASWS can aid in improving the ability of the agricultural ecosystem to resist extreme natural disasters and stabilise grain production in China. In this study, ASWS in the 0-5.0 m profile was measured in an area of approximately 36.9 x 10(4) km(2) in the middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin. The total ASWS in the 0-5.0 m profile of the study area was 113 x 10(10) m(3), 85% of which was stored in the 450 mm rainfall zone. Regarding the 1.0-5.0 m soil layer and 450 mm rainfall zone, edaphic properties were the dominant factors determining the spatial characteristics of ASWS. Based on the spatial characteristics of ASWS, the shallow soil water (0-1.0 m) in the middle region and deep soil moisture (1.0-5.0 m) in the southern region of the study area can support the rational use of soil water in agricultural and vegetation restoration activities. Large-scale revegetation activities using trees or shrubs might not be the optimal choice in regions with mean annual precipitation < 450 mm. Knowledge of the spatial characteristics and contributions of the ASWS controlling factors is indispensable for reasonable agricultural regionalisation and vegetation restoration, as well as for an invulnerable and stable grain output system.																			0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 1	2021	257								107131	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107131		AUG 2021											WOS:000703159300001

By conducting a meta-analysis of 1928 observations from 158 independent experimental studies, we quantified the direction and magnitude of different interactions (i.e., additive, synergistic, and antagonistic) between N and P additions on eight variables related to belowground C pools and fluxes. The results showed that the interactions were antagonistic for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and heterotrophic respiration (Rh), and were additive for soil organic carbon (SOC), fungal biomass, and soil respiration (Rs). Synergistic interactions occurred less frequently than additive or antagonistic interactions, and were observed for bacterial and total microbial biomass (TPLFAs). Additive interactions dominated the responses of most belowground C pools and fluxes among different terrestrial ecosystems, whereas antagonistic interactions were found for DOC in subtropical forest, MBC in tropical/subtropical forest, SOC in cropland, and fungal/bacterial biomass in tundra. Synergistic interactions were rare and were found only for MBC in temperate forest and Rh in tropical forest and wetland. The responses of belowground C pools and fluxes to N and P additions were significantly dependent on environmental or experimental conditions. Our meta-analysis highlighted the importance of soil microbes in affecting belowground C-cycling processes, and identified some key interactions to be implemented into C-cycling models for predicting the impacts of increasing depositions of N and P on terrestrial C uptake in the future.					wang, ying-ping/A-9765-2011	wang, ying-ping/0000-0002-4614-6203; Du, Yue/0000-0002-0723-0816; chang, zhongbing/0000-0003-1470-6939													0038-0717	1879-3428				MAY	2021	156								108216	10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108216	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108216		MAR 2021											WOS:000640189100002

Moss-dominated biocrusts enhance water vapor sorption capacity of surface soil and increase non-rainfall water deposition in drylands	GEODERMA												Surface soil vapor sorption and non-rainfall water (NRW) deposition are important sources, and can be highly influential in soil water dynamics and biochemical processes in drylands. As an important living skin, biocrusts have great impacts on soil water balance and play a vital role in water transport at near surface soil, while it remains unclear how biocrusts affect soil water vapor sorption and NRW deposition. In this study, we analyzed and modeled the water vapor sorption isotherms (WSIs) of moss-dominated biocrusts and uncrusted surfaces on loess soil and aeolian sand in the Chinese Loess Plateau. Furthermore, the actual NRW deposition amount of the biocrusts and uncrused soil in field was continuously measured across similar to 4 months in summer. Our results showed that the vapor sorption amount of the biocrusts was increased by up to 130.5% on the loess and 157.1% on the aeolian sand, and soil vapor sorption capacity of the biocrusts was mostly attributed to their higher contents of fine particles (clay and silt) and organic matter, and the moss morphology in comparison to the uncrusted soil. The Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) model performed well (R-2 > 0.97, RMSE < 0.0005 g g(-1), E < 13.2%) in simulating WSIs of each treatment. Moreover, the biocrusts enlarged the hysteresis effects by > 23.1%-200.0% as compared with the uncrusted soil at 0-10 cm depth. Additionally, the daily NRW amount of the biocrusts was increased by 19.2% on loess soil and 22.0% on aeolian sand, respectively, which means that the biocrusts significantly increased the NRW deposition capacity at 0-10 cm depth (F >= 11.12, P < 0.001). Lastly, the surface soil temperature of the biocrust layer was averagely 1.0-2.3 degrees C higher than that of the uncrusted soil during daytime, indicating that the biocrust layer enlarged the daily soil temperature differences between the crusted and uncrusted soils, and consequently increased the hourly NRW amount. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the important effects of biocrusts in improving vapor sorption capacity and NRW deposition of surface soil, and these properties in return would further generate feedback impacts on surface soil water and heat balances, enhancing microbial activity within the soil profile and nutrient adsorption from NRW in drylands.

Development of temperate basmati rice: a multi-year study on performance and adaptation under high altitude conditions of Northern Himalayas	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												In the present study, an effective secondary selection of transgressive variants from a homozygous population of Pusa Sugandh 3 (PS3) has led to the development of basmati variant SKUA 494. SKUA 494 exhibited a grain yield (7.9 t/ha) with superiority of 21.5% over its progenitor (6.5 t/ha). Besides, the genotype revealed an earliness of about 13 and 15 days for flowering and maturity, respectively. Hulling, milling and head rice recovery traits of SKUA 494 were comparatively better over the controls PS3 and Pusa Basmati 1509. No significant differences in the cooking quality were observed in SKUA 494 over its parental line. Quality traits of SKUA 494 revealed an intermediate score for alkali spreading value, besides similar values for gel consistency and amylose content in comparison to PS3. On the basis of stability variables, stability index and overall mean for most of the traits, SKUA 494 depicted stable performance across the locations and over the years. Molecular analysis based on simple sequence repeat markers revealed polymorphism at locus flanking the quantitative trait loci for days to heading (Hd6) between SKUA 494 and its parent (PS3). Based on overall superiority in the performance and adaptability of SKUA 494, the variety has been recommended to farmers for general cultivation under temperate ecology.

To solve the problems of unreasonable and unscientific spatial allocation of regional agricultural irrigation PWs, this paper proposes a new strategy for updating agricultural irrigation PWs based on a spatial decision model, using Songzhuang Town, Tongzhou District, Beijing as a case study. The model utilizes constraints based on local factors such as actual land use, and proposes a novel feasible solution strategy that combines random local search and abrupt jumps to increase the probability that feasible solutions will be found, addressing the performance issues of simulated annealing algorithms, influence of initial values, and parameter sensitivity. Finally, we used the proposed method to perform updated decision analysis on the spatial configuration of PWs in the study area. The results showed that most of the crops in the study area lack irrigation, and the currently available PWs cannot meet the needs for irrigation. The new PWs added based on this decision method can be more evenly distributed within the predefined optimization unit. The proposed number of PWs to be added is 166, the density of PWs is 0.04/ha, and the crop area covered by the PWs is 3350.43 ha. In contrast to the previous PW layout, the optimized PW configuration can meet the irrigation needs of residents, indicating that the new method proposed in this paper has good potential for extension and application.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				DEC	2023	78								102316	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102316	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102316		OCT 2023											WOS:001087160900001

Dark diversity of flea assemblages of small mammalian hosts: effects of environment, host traits and host phylogeny	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												An assemblage of species in a locality comprises two components, namely (i) species that are present (realised diversity) and (ii) species from the regional pool that may potentially inhabit this locality due to suitable ecological conditions, but that are absent (dark diversity). We investigated factors affecting the dark diversity of component communities of fleas parasitic on small mammals in the northern Palearctic at two scales. First, we considered the dark diversity of flea assemblages of the same host (for 13 host species) across regions and tested for the effects of environmental factors and the number of available host species on the dark diversity of within-region flea assemblages. Second, we considered the dark diversity of fleas across host species within a region (for 20 regions) and asked whether within host dark diversity is associated with host phylogeny and/or traits. We found that the dark diversity of flea assemblages harboured by small mammals varied substantially (i) within the same host species across space (in 12 of 13 host species) and (ii) between host species within a region (in eight of 20 regions). The size of the dark diversity of flea assemblages of the same host across regions was generally affected by environmental factors (mainly by the amount of green vegetation), whereas the size of the dark diversity of flea assemblages of a host species within a region was affected by host traits (mainly by the degree of host sociality and the structure of its shelter and, to a lesser degree, by its geographic range size) but was not associated with host phylogenetic affinities. We conclude that application of the dark diversity concept to parasite communities across space or hosts allows a better understanding of the factors affecting the species richness and composition of these communities.

Sorghum silage substituted for corn silage in diets for dairy cows: Effects on feed intake, milk yield and quality, and serum metabolites	APPLIED ANIMAL SCIENCE												Objective: Whole-plant corn silage (CS) is the main forage fed to dairy cows in China, usually comprising about 35% of the total DM of the TMR. However, sorghum is more resistant to drought and tolerates soils that are less fertile compared with corn, and consequently, sorghum silage (SS) would be preferable to CS in many drought-prone areas of China. Sweet SS is characterized by a high content of water-soluble carbohydrates and energy yield. Previous studies examined the effects of feeding either CS or SS in the TMR of lactating cows. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of substituting different levels of sweet SS for CS in the TMR fed to dairy cows in a smallholder farm in western China. Materials and Methods: Sixteen multiparous Holstein cows (mean BW of 454 +/- 25 kg), producing approximately 12 kg/d milk, were assigned randomly to 4 dietary treatments. Experimental diets were formulated to be iso-energetic and iso-nitrogenous with 45% forage and 55% concentrate, and the diets included 10% oat hay and variable proportions of CS and SS. Dietary treatments included (1) 100% CS (35% DM of TMR, control diet); (2) 35% of CS replaced by SS; (3) 65% of CS replaced by SS; and (4) 100% of CS replaced by SS. Results and Discussion: The DMI decreased linearly (P = 0.002) as SS increased. Milk yield and lactose percentage did not differ among treatments, but lactose yield exhibited a cubic response (P = 0.004), whereas milk fat percentage tended to increase linearly (P = 0.077) as SS increased. Increasing SS resulted in a quadratic response in milk protein percentage and yield (P = 0.001) and MUN increased linearly as SS increased (P = 0.022). The ECM/DMI ranged between 0.75 and 0.82 and increased linearly as SS increased (P = 0.029). Although there were differences among treatments in serum concentrations of aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea nitrogen, and glucose, all concentrations were in the normal range for healthy, lactating cows. Serum beta-hydroxybutyric acid concentrations were well below the subclinical levels in all treatments. The SCC decreased linearly (P = 0.024) with increasing SS. Implications and Applications: We concluded that for low-producing dairy cows, SS can replace CS in total in the diet without adverse effects on milk yield and its components and on serum metabolites. This is particularly important for small dairy herds in dry areas.

Its water resource amount per capita is only 361 m(3), about 1/6 of the average in China and less than 1/20 of the average in the world. Surface water and groundwater (SW-GW) interaction, having a significant influence on the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources, was qualitatively and quantitatively investigated during a wet year based on stable isotopes and hydrochemistry. The results show that the recharge pattern in the north part varies with season, that is, 40% of the surface water recharge comes from groundwater in the dry season, but 93% of the groundwater recharge comes from surface water in the rainy season. In the south part, groundwater is always recharged by surface water, with contributions of 47% and 61% in the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. For the main stream, the recharge pattern is complicated and varies with season and site. This study will provide useful information about SW-GW interaction at basin scale. Integrated management of groundwater and surface water could improve the efficiency of regional water resources utilization and promote accurate and sustainable water management in the semi-arid basin.

M.; Ding, Luming; Wu, Gao-Lin			Shrub encroachment increases soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in alpine grassland ecosystems of the central Tibetan Plateau	GEODERMA												Shrub encroachment can significantly affect the ecosystem structure and functioning of alpine grasslands. However, little is known about how this phenomenon alters soil organic carbon stocks (SOCS) and soil nitrogen stocks (STNS) in different alpine grassland ecosystems within the same region. Here we addressed this research gap by investigating the SOCS and STNS of encroached and non-encroached plots in alpine meadow and alpine steppe ecosystems on the central Tibetan Plateau. We found that, in both ecosystems, shrub encroachment significantly increased herbaceous plant richness, diversity, and aboveground biomass, but more notably in alpine meadow. Conversely, shrub encroachment increased belowground plant biomass in alpine steppe but had the opposite effect in alpine meadow, where belowground biomass was four times lower at encroached than at non-encroached plots. Importantly, encroaching shrubs resulted in significantly higher SOCS and STNS in both ecosystems, with alpine steppe showing the greatest carbon and nitrogen gains. The shrub encroached plots had 34.24 % and 97.25 % higher carbon stocks and 70.87 % and 67.34 % higher nitrogen stocks than non-encroached plots at the alpine meadow and alpine steppe, respectively. Increases in carbon and nitrogen stocks occurred mostly at the 10-30 cm soil layer and were highly correlated with shrub-induced changes in the herbaceous community composition. Overall, our results indicated that (1) shrub encroachment promoted carbon and ni-trogen accumulation in the soils of both alpine meadow and alpine steppe and (2) the degree of accumulation and the mechanisms behind these changes varied between the two alpine grasslands. Our findings advance the general understanding of the soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in shrub-encroached alpine grasslands and highlight the importance of investigating how this phenomenon affects different ecosystems within the same region.

However, evidence suggests that other plant parts such as fruit, leaves, and stem are also potential sources of bioactive compounds. Therefore, this study aimed at providing insight into the differential accumulation of metabolites in fruit, leaf, root, and stem tissues collected from P. notoginseng. A total of 808 metabolites from 11 major metabolite classes were identified. Furthermore, 32 Ginsenosides with six conserved Ginsenosides Rg1, Rf, St-3, R1, Ro, Rc, and five conserved notoginsenosides R1, K, M, E, Rb1, were identified with differential accumulation in fruit, leaf, stem, and root tissues. Several other metabolites known for their potential roles in human health were also identified as differentially accumulated in the tissues. Furthermore, the accumulation pattern of ginsenosides in different tissues is highly suggestive of utilizing fruit, leaf, and stem tissues along with roots for value addition of P. notoginseng.																			1094-2912	1532-2386				DEC 31	2022	25	1					1132	1145		10.1080/10942912.2022.2071294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2022.2071294													WOS:000792928500001

However, their contributions to total soil loss have never been quantified systematically at various spatial scales. Here we selected an agricultural catchment with ephemeral and classic gullies in Keshan county, Heilongjiang province. The fallout Cs-137 activity adjusted to fine fraction of < 63 mu m was employed as tracer to quantify the contribution of fine sediment eroded from topsoil and subsoil (gully bank) in the whole catchment and each sub-catchment by using a linear mixing model. The results showed that the coefficient of variations (CVs) of Cs-137 activity for subsoil, ranging from 86.4 to 166.1%, were greater than those of topsoil varying from 18.2 to 39.9%. In topsoil, cropland had the greatest Cs-137 concentration in both < 1 mm and < 63 mu m fractions, followed by forestland and road. Although the Cs-137 activity varied greatly in sources, the contrasting concentrations between sources render Cs-137 an effective tracer for distinguishing topsoil and subsoil contributions to sediment discharge. The allocated proportions of both deposited (bed) and suspended (trap) sediment with different particle sizes showed the eroded fine sediment (<63 mu m fraction) of the catchment mainly came from gully bank, accounting for about 90%, but the significant difference of apportionment between deposited and suspended sediment was obtained in some catchments, indicating that caution must be exercised when taking deposited sediment out of bed materials. The result for suspended sediment showed contributions of subsoil in catchment with classic gullies were greater than those with ephemeral gullies, and the gully head and bank were the primary sediment sources. This study provided valuable quantitative information of sediment sources for agricultural catchments with both ephemeral and classic gullies, and suggested soil conservation measures be concentrated on stabilizing gullies, especially controlling gully head advance.

Although convincing evidence indicated that mixed forests have higher resistance and resil-ience to climate change and natural disturbance than monocultures, it is unclear how mixed-species plantations affect SWS. By conducting a meta-analysis of 1071 paired observations in mixed-species plantations and monoculture plantations from 45 studies, we showed that, on average, the SWS of mixed-species plantations at 0-500 cm was 10.81% higher than that of monoculture plantations. Importantly, these positive mixture effects increased over time, with greater positive effects in mixed tree and shrub plantations. The effects of mixed-species plantations on SWS shifted from positive to negative with increasing soil depth, and these mixing ef-fects in the topsoil layer (0-100 cm) became more pronounced with increasing stand age. However, the mixture effects on SWS did not vary with the mean annual temperature and precipitation. Moreover, mixed-species plantations were more conducive to enhancing the SWS capacity in areas with a low initial SWS. Structural equation models demonstrated that stand age was the main factor controlling the change in SWS, and soil depth also reduced the effect size of SWS by influencing the initial SWS. Our findings highlight that protecting and promoting functionally diverse forests improves SWS capacity, thereby alleviating soil moisture stress in arid and semiarid regions.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				JAN 15	2024	552								121571	10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2023.121571		NOV 2023											WOS:001121252000001

The integrated strategies include high-throughput phenotyping, next generation sequencing (NGS)-based genotyping technologies, and a priori selected candidate gene studies that help understand the detailed physiological and molecular mechanisms underpinning this complex trait. A set of sixty diverse sorghum genotypes was evaluated for different vegetative, reproductive, and yield traits related to NUE in the field (under three N regimes) for two seasons. Significant variations for different yield and related traits under 0 and 50% N confirmed the availability of native genetic variability in sorghum under low N regimes. Sorghum genotypes with distinct genetic background had interestingly similar NUE associated traits. The Genotyping-By-Sequencing based SNPs (>89 K) were used to study the population structure, and phylogenetic groupings identified three distinct groups. The information of grain N and stalk N content of the individuals covered on the phylogenetic groups indicated randomness in the distribution for adaptation under variable N regimes. This study identified promising sorghum genotypes with consistent performance under varying environments, with buffer capacity for yield under low N conditions. We also report better performing genotypes for varied production use-grain, stover, and dual-purpose sorghum having differential adaptation response to NUE traits. Expression profiling of NUE associated genes in shoot and root tissues of contrasting lines (PVK801 and HDW703) grown in varying N conditions revealed interesting outcomes. Root tissues of contrasting lines exhibited differential expression profiles for transporter genes [ammonium transporter (SbAMT), nitrate transporters (SbNRT)]; primary assimilatory (glutamine synthetase (SbGS), glutamate synthase (SbGOGAT[NADH], SbGOGAT[Fd]), assimilatory genes [nitrite reductase (SbNiR[NADH]3)]; and amino acid biosynthesis associated gene [glutamate dehydrogenase (SbGDH)]. Identification and expression profiling of contrasting sorghum genotypes in varying N dosages will provide new information to understand the response of NUE genes toward adaptation to the differential N regimes in sorghum. High NUE genotypes identified from this study could be potential candidates for in-depth molecular analysis and contribute toward the development of N efficient sorghum cultivars.

Damage of check dams by extreme rainstorms on the Chinese Loess Plateau: A case study in the Chabagou watershed	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION					73rd Soil-and-Water-Conservation-Society's International Annual Conference in Albuquerque	JUL 29-AUG 01, 2018	NM	Soil & Water Conservat Soc, USDA Nat Resources Conservat Serv, US Geol Survey				Check dams are widely distributed and abundant on the Chinese Loess Plateau and play an important role both in reducing damage from flash floods and in retaining sediment. Some check dams are destroyed either partially or fully during rainstorms. The investigation of the actual damage caused to check dams as a result of specific rainstorm floods is of great value for analyzing their effects and failure modes, and is also helpful for proposing a reasonable approach for their improvement.The "7.26" extreme rainstorm event on July 25 and 26, 2017, in Yulin in northern Shaanxi Province, China, resulted in serious infrastructural damage and economic losses. This study reports on a detailed investigation undertaken between August 27 and October 28, 2017, of the causes and severity of the damage to the check dams in the Chabagou watershed. The results showed that out of a total of 572 check dams surveyed, 63.6% were destroyed and 9.3% were damaged. The mean dam opening was 4.8 m wide and 3.4 m deep, while the mean water culvert was 1.7 m wide and 2 m deep.The main causes of the damage were as follows: (1) the flood return period exceeded the dam design standards, (2) 94.1% of the check dams lacked a spillway, and (3) the main land use types on the check dams were farmland and bare soil. Based on the findings of this study, the following recommendations are made: (1) improve the existing design standards for check dams, (2) build additional spillways and maintain existing spillways in a timely fashion, and (3) encourage the development of natural grass and shrub land as the best land use type on check dams.																			0022-4561	1941-3300				NOV-DEC	2020	75	6					746	754		10.2489/jswc.2020.00138	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.2020.00138													WOS:000590759300011

The Chezy and Manning equations are the most widely used for calculating flow velocity in runoff and erosion models. The suitability of both equations for overland flow on bare land has been evaluated, and conflicting results were obtained in previous studies. The suitability of these equations for overland flow on a planted slope requires further investigation. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the suitability of the Chezy and Manning equations under planted conditions and evaluate quantitative effect of vegetation on Manning's n and then on flow velocity. Flume experiments were conducted at the plant basal cover ranging from 0 to 30%, slope gradient varying from 8.8% to 25.9%, and flow discharge ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 x 10(-3) m(3) s(-1). The flow depth and flow velocity were measured. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) were used to compare the performance accuracy of both equations. The results showed that both equations provided a bad accuracy when plant basal cover was greater than 15% on a planted slope. The NSE values were negative for Manning equation and close to 0 for Chezy equation. It indicates that Manning and Chezy equations were not suitable for the planted slope. Manning's n decreased with the flow depth for 0% plant basal cover and increased with flow depth for plant basal cover greater than 1.25%. Thus a new equation for calculating Manning's n was developed based on plant basal cover and flow depth and was used in the Manning equation. The new flow velocity equation including plant basal cover provided satisfactory accuracy with a NSE of 0.995. The results indicate that the Manning's n was significantly affected by flow depth and plant basal cover.

Afforested trees exhibit distinct growth and survival strategies on distinct habitats on the Northern Loess Plateau in China. The objective of this study was to quantify tree transpiration discrepancies of two tree species aged > 30 years on different soil and topography conditions, and to explore the interactions with the atmosphere, hydrology, soil and topography, through long-term (up to seven years) observations of sap flow, meteorological factors and soil water contents (SWC). Results showed that mean whole-tree transpiration (T) of Salix matsudana and Populus simonii in the growing season were 46.7 and 175.2 kg d(-1), respectively, in a dam field, and were 5.6-fold and 4.2-fold the magnitude of that on a sloping field, respectively. Daily T was positively correlated (P < 0.001) with meteorological factors (i.e., reference evapotranspiration, ETo; solar radiation, R n ; vapor- pressure deficit, VPD). Daytime ETo explained 37% of S. matsudana variation in T on the sloping field, up to 77% of the variation on a dam field, and 80% of the variation in T from P. simonii on both fields. The T of S. matsudana was significantly positively correlated with SWC from topsoil to 200 cm depth, and the correlation increased (partial R up to 0.55 at 200 cm depth) as depth increased on sloping field. However, no consistent correlations between T and shallow depth SWC existed on S. matsudana and P. simonii on dam fields and P. simonii on sloping field. Annual rainfall soil-water recharge depth reached up to 600 cm in wet years, but only 120 cm in dry years on sloping field with aeolian sandy soil, and was 200 cm even in wet years in dam field with loessial soil. Trees on the dam field absorbed water mainly from shallow groundwater. Tree fine roots gathered in the subsurface soil on the sloping field but not in the dam field indicated a root distribution adaption to precipitation patterns and water-use strategy. Soil water deficit formed in the 0-600 cm soil layer on the S. matsudana sloping field in normal and dry years, and soil water was replenished during wet years. Neither species is suitable for extensive revegetation implementation in this area due to their negative impacts on water resource sustainability.

In past decades, re-vegetation of degraded sandy soils to prevent soil erosion has been widely employed, including in Mu Us Sandy Land, which suffers from severe soil erosion. However, it remains unclear how re-vegetation affects soil properties and soil microbes after long restoration periods. In this study, typical plots planting Artemisia ordosica and Salix psammophila were selected to investigate the influence of plant types on soil properties; an area of bare sandy land was used as a control. The results show that re-vegetation increased soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), soil microbial carbon, microbial nitrogen and soil organic acid, while decreasing soil total phosphorous (TP) content significantly, resulting in increased C/P and N/P ratios. Corre-lation analysis showed that TP was negatively correlated with oxalic acid (OA) and acetic acid (AA), indicating that increased AA and OA content could accelerate the active utilization of phosphorus and induced low TP in soil. Re-vegetation with A. ordosica significantly decreased the microbial diversity of topsoil. The redundancy analysis showed that TP was main index in affecting microbes. These results that lower P content, higher C/P and N/P ratio and influence of TP on microbes suggest that phosphorus is the main limiting factor for re-vegetation and growth of soil microorganisms. In the future, strategies for the development of sustainable ecosystems in regions suffers from severe soil erosion should consider phosphorus supplementation.

They have sustained over generations owing to the preference of local communities for their unique taste, the utility to particular dishes, and the low cost of cultivation. They may help eradicate malnutrition and act as a source for trait-linked genes. The present dataset comprises thirty-three native germplasm of maize collected from Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh states of India with an altitudinal variation of 386-2,028 m. They were evaluated for proximate composition, minerals, nutritional attributes, and antioxidant activity and compared with the standard values reported in the Indian Food Composition Table 2017 (IFCT2017). The nutritional profile showed moisture content in the range of 7.16-10.9%, ash 0.73-1.93%, crude protein 8.68-12.0%, crude fat 3.72-8.03%, dietary fiber 5.21-11.2%, and available carbohydrates 60.6-69.8%. Three accessions, namely, Malan 11 (7.06%), Malan 24 (7.20%), and Yellow Chamba Local 02 (8.03%) exhibited almost double the crude fat content as compared with the values notified in IFCT2017 (3.77). Total sugar content obtained was in the range of 5.00-11.3%, whereas the starch content was found between 50.9 and 64.9%. All the germplasm except Yellow Chamba Local reflected a higher protein content than reported values in IFCT2017 (8.80). Sathi, Safed Chamba Local, and Ragal Makka had nearly 12% protein content. Mineral malnutrition, mainly due to iron (Fe) deficiency, is a worldwide issue to science, humanity, and society. The mineral profile revealed that most germplasm had a higher iron content. Accessions with the iron content of nearly three times of IFCT2017 reported value were identified in germplasm belonging to three states. A negative relationship was observed between the altitude of the sample collection site and available carbohydrate content. In contrast, available carbohydrate showed inverse correlations with dietary fiber, protein, and fat content. The information generated in this study can be utilized to promote these germplasm as nutrifood, nutritional surveillance, labeling, and crop improvement programs.					kumari, Jyoti/GSE-6263-2022; Langyan, Sapna/AAD-2571-2022	Langyan, Sapna/0000-0003-2826-1803													2296-861X					APR 11	2022	9								812599	10.3389/fnut.2022.812599	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.812599								35479746					WOS:000792456300001

Knowledge of soil community-level elemental homeostasis following natural vegetation restoration is specially limited for the abandoned farmlands. This study examined the changes in soil microbial biomass stoichiometry and homeostasis with a chronosequence of 3, 8, 13, 18, 23 and 30 years following natural vegetation restoration since farmland abandonment on the Loess Plateau, China. Vegetation communities, soil properties, microbial communities, and enzyme activities were analyzed to study the drivers on soil microbial C:N:P stoichiometry. The results showed that soil microbial biomass C: N ratios had little change following natural vegetation restoration since farmland abandonment, natural vegetation >23 years had significantly enhanced the microbial biomass C:P and N:P ratios by 26.1%-133.9% and 31.7%-67.4%, respectively. However, microbial biomass C:N, C:P and N:P ratios were constrained following natural vegetation restoration. Vegetation restoration for 30 years enhanced urease and alkaline phosphatase activities by 125.4% and 42.9%, respectively, which showed synchronous changes with N and P contents in microbial biomass. Soil fungi, urease and alkaline phosphatase were the drivers to the changes in microbial C:N:P stoichiometry. The results suggest that long-lean vegetation restoration (>23 years) will aggravate microbial P limitation, however, soil microorganism maintained the homeostatic regulation of stoichiometric ratios to mitigate P limitation. Fungi played a strong role in shaping microbial community-level elemental homeostasis and nutrient cycling through releasing N-converting and P-converting enzymes into soil following natural vegetation restoration.

Accordingly, substantial research has been conducted on the concept of the water resources carrying capacity (WRCC). In this study, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and system dynamics (SD) models were combined to construct a multi-criteria evaluation system of the WRCC and a socio-economic/water resources SD model for Xi'an. The developmental trends of the society, economy, water supply/demand, and wastewater discharge were obtained from 2015 to 2020 using five scenarios designed for distinct purposes; these scenarios and trends were comprehensively evaluated using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results indicated that the WRCC (0.32 in 2020) in Xi'an will shift from a normal to a poor state if the current social development pattern is maintained; therefore, we conclude that the socio-economic development of Xi'an is unsustainable. However, under a comprehensive scheme, the WRCC index (0.64 in 2020) will increase by 48% compared with the WRCC index under a business-as-usual scenario. Further, some practical suggestions, including the promotion of industrial reforms and the improvement of water-use efficiency and recycling policies, were provided for improving the regional WRCC.

In this study, two sets of experiments, namely, upstream inflow with rainfall and upstream inflow only, were conducted to investigate the resistance characteristics of SF on a flat and smooth flume with three gentle slopes (3 degrees, 5 degrees and 7 degrees). The experimental results indicated that in the tests with upstream inflow only, the Darcy-Weisbach resistance (f) and Manning coefficient (n) decreased following a power function with increasing flow depth. When the Reynolds number (Re) was less than 1070, the n and f of the SF in the upstream inflow alone decreased with increasing Re following the power function. Both the n and f of the SF increased with increasing rainfall intensity for the upstream inflow with the rainfall tests. The rainfall significantly affected the f and n of the SF in the low Re zone (Re < 1070), inflow discharge (<0.06 m(2) min(-1)) and flow energy for all inflow with rainfall cases. Under the conditions of upstream inflow with rainfall, both the f and n of the SF decreased with the increase in the ratio between the flow depth and median raindrop diameter (H/D50) in the power function. This result indicated that a deeper flow could dissipate more raindrop energy. In addition, empirical equations among Re, hydraulic slope and H/D50 were established to predict the n and f of the SF for upstream inflow with rainfall tests. This study will be helpful in understanding the combined effects of rainfall and flow depth on SF and could provide a scientific basis for improving hydrological and soil erosion models.

However, the characteristics of specific enzyme activities and temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) in the rhizosphere remain elusive. We collected rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from a secondary successional series (0, 7, 12, 17, 22, and 32 years after farmland abandonment, and a natural grassland reference) in a typical semi-arid ecosystems on the Loess Plateau of China. The potential activity of soil enzymes, including beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG), beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and alkaline phosphatase (AP), was assayed at 37, 20 and 4 degrees C and expressed as activity per unit of soil organic carbon (specific enzyme activity). Q(10) values were calculated at 20-37 degrees C and 4-20 degrees C, respectively. The specific enzyme activities of BG, NAG, LAP and AP in bulk soil increased to a maximum at the 17-year site and then significantly decreased in older grasslands. In the rhizosphere, specific enzyme activities increased and then decreased along the successional gradient with significantly higher value at the 7-year site and the 17-year site. The Q(10) values of BG activity in bulk soil and the four enzyme's activities in rhizosphere soil were changed significantly along the successional gradients. In general, the Q(10) values at the two temperature ranges differed in bulk soil, but not in the rhizosphere soil. Along the plant successional gradient, the rhizosphere effects of specific enzyme activities gradually changed to negative values in the oldest sites. Our results indicate that plant secondary succession had different impacts on the enzyme activity and characteristics in the rhizosphere and bulk soil, and highlights the importance of temperature sensitivity and rhizosphere effects of enzyme activity along plant secondary successional gradients.

Many studies have focused on the sediment transport capacity for overland flow; however, few studies have explored the relationship between sediment transport capacity and soil aggregate characteristics. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of soil aggregate characteristics on the sediment transport capacity of overland flow. The unit flow discharge ranged from 0.68 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1) to 5.41 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1), and the slope gradient varied from 5.24% to 26.80%. Five types of typical Chinese soil were investigated. The results showed that the best correlation was the relationship between the sediment transport capacity and the mass percentage of aggregates greater than 0.25 mm (WSA(0.25)) under the Le Bissonnais method of wetting stirring conditions. Sediment transport capacity was not correlated to the other soil aggregate characteristics, including the mean weight diameter (MWD) under the Le Bissonnais method of fast wetting and slow wetting conditions and the Yoder method, the degree of aggregation (A), and the fractal dimension (D) under the Yoder method. New equations including WSA(0.25) were developed to predict the sediment transport capacity. The equation including flow discharge, slope gradient and WSA(0.25) provided the best accuracy for predicting sediment transport capacity. The sediment transport capacity increased linearly with the mean flow velocity. Between the hydraulic variables of shear stress and stream power, our results showed that stream power was an optimal predictor for calculating sediment transport capacity. These findings offer a new approach for predicting the sediment transport capacity of overland flow.																			0016-7061	1872-6259				JUN 15	2020	369								114338	10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114338													WOS:000524458800012

The role of these phytohormones was assessed on several physicochemical properties of safflower plants subjected to salinity. JA and, especially SA, caused plants had more Na+ and less K+ content compared with the control plants. The JA and SA increased the catalase (CAT) activity, whereas significantly decreased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation in safflower plants under salinity stress. No significant effects of phytohormones were observed on peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities in safflower plants exposed to salinity stress. Data on plant fluorescence indicated that seed priming with JA and SA decreases ROS production in photosystems. The effect of JA and SA under salinity stress was observed to significantly influence the light-dependent phase (J-I and I-P phases of chlorophyll a fluorescence curve) in comparison to the rest of the electron transport chain in safflower plants. This finding was supported by the high improvement of quantum yield of reduction of the end electron acceptors at the photosystem I acceptor side (phi Ro) activity under severe salinity stress. The observation indicated that the SA treatment was more effective in safflower plants exposed to salinity stress in comparison to the JA treatment.																			0190-4167	1532-4087				2023 NOV 6	2023										10.1080/01904167.2023.2280125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2023.2280125		NOV 2023											WOS:001102558900001

The genetic basis of grain nutritional traits remains largely unknown. Marker-assisted selection using significant loci identified through genome-wide association study (GWAS) shows potential for selecting desirable traits in crops. This study assessed natural variation available in sorghum accessions from around the globe to identify novel genes or genomic regions with potential for improving grain nutritional value, and to study associations between DR traits and grain weight and nutritional composition.ResultsWe dissected the genetic architecture of grain nutritional composition, protein content, thousand-kernel weight (TKW), and plant height (PH) in sorghum through GWAS of 163 unique African and Asian accessions under irrigated and post-flowering drought conditions. Several QTLs were detected. Some were significantly associated with DR, TKW, PH, protein, and Zn, Mn, and Ca contents. Genomic regions on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, and 10 were associated with TKW, nutritional, and DR traits; colocalization patterns of these markers indicate potential for simultaneous improvement of these traits. In African accessions, markers associated with TKW were mapped to six regions also associated with protein, Zn, Ca, Mn, Na, and DR, suggesting the potential for simultaneous selection for higher grain nutrition and TKW. Our results indicate that it may be possible to select for increased DR on the basis of grain nutrition and weight potential.ConclusionsThis study provides a valuable resource for selecting landraces for use in plant breeding programs and for identifying loci that may contribute to grain nutrition and weight with the hope of producing cultivars that combine improved yield traits, nutrition, and DR.

Slow decomposition rate limits straw return in sandy fields, which has becoming one of the obstacles in sandy land reclamation. Ammonification of straw before return accelerates straw decomposition, but it requires the use of extra N fertilizer, however, little is known about N fertilizer management in fields with ammoniated straw incorporation. So, a 3-year field experiment was conducted with different proportions of N fertilizer aimed to maize straw ammonification and field broadcasting, and evaluated straw decomposition proportion, straw N release, soil organic carbon content, soil aggregates, soil water and N availability, and grain yield. Total N application rate was 300 kg per hectare, with five N input amounts for straw per hectare ammonification: 0 (SN0), 40 (SN40), 80 (SN80), 120 (SN120), and 160 (SN160) kg, and the rest of N broadcasted in soil during maize growing season. Ammonification accelerated straw decomposition and N release, and these effects showed no significant difference between SN80, SN120, and SN160. After straw decomposition for 150 days, the decomposition proportion was 62.1%, 53.0%, and 39.2% in SN80, SN40, and SN0, respectively. After 3 years of straw return, SN80 exhibited a significantly higher mean weight diameter of soil aggregates (35.6% higher), organic carbon content (18.4% higher), water-holding capacity (17.4% higher), and soil water storage (17.2% higher) than SN0. Additionally, SN80 and SN120 showed the most significant effect on "N slow-release" in soil. The above effects resulted with more available soil water and N used for crop growth, and increased grain yields (18.1% higher) and water use efficiency (18.6% higher) in SN80, compared with SN0. Hence, we conclude that a proper N allocation between straw and soil can synergistically enhance soil structure and crop productivity in sandy farmlands. This founding would provide scientific and technological support for straw return in sandy fields and is beneficial to sustainable development of oasis.

J	Wang, RZ; Yang, L; Gao, X; Guo, SL; Wang, R				Wang, Runze; Yang, Lin; Gao, Xin; Guo, Shengli; Wang, Rui			Changes in fungal diversity and key-stone taxa along soil-eroding catena	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Fungal communities play an important role in soil biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem function. The redistribution of water and soil causes significant differences in the soil physicochemical properties in eroding landscapes. However, changes in soil fungal diversity and key-stone taxa in soil-eroding catena remain poorly understood in these landscapes. In the current study, the diversity and key-stone taxa of the fungal community in topsoil samples were analyzed from three typical erosive topographic units (autonomous, transitional, and depositional zones). The Chao 1 index showed a decrease from the autonomous and transitional zones (1759.7 and 1752.6, respectively) to the depositional zone (1535.3), but there were no significant differences in the Shannon index. Transitional and depositional networks had fewer edges (318 and 387, respectively) and clustering coefficients (0.236 and 0.301, respectively) than the autonomous network (911 and 0.362, respectively). At the phylum level, the nutritional strategists of key-stone taxa tended to shift from r- to K-strategists along the soil-eroding catena, indicating that the majority of key-stone taxa were dominated by the phylum Ascomycota in the autonomous and transitional zones, whereas the phylum Basidiomycota was dominant in the depositional zone. The recalcitrant carbon composition (C--C/C--O, autonomous vs. transitional vs. depositional: 3.82 vs. 5.09 vs. 7.52) may have contributed to the decreased fungal richness along the soil-eroding catena. The primary controlling factors affecting key-stone taxa were soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and Olsen-P in the autonomous zone, SOC and C-H/C--O in the transitional zone, and C--C/C--O in the depositional zone. Exploring the changes in fungal diversity and key-stone taxa among different erosive topographic units can contribute to an in-depth understanding of the biogeochemical cycle in the eroding environment.																			0929-1393	1873-0272				AUG	2023	188								104924	10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.104924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.104924		APR 2023											WOS:000983569700001

EFFECTS OF GENOTYPE-BY-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION ON THE MAIN AGRONOMIC TRAITS OF MAIZE HYBRIDS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model and genotype main effects and genotype-by-environment interaction (GGE) biplot are commonly used to analyze multi environmental trial data. This study adopted the AMMI model and GGE biplot to comprehensively analyze the data on genotypes tested in the 2016-2017 Zhongcheng combined regional maize trial in China Results showed that the traits highly and significantly differed across different genotypes (G) and environments (E). Significant or very significant genotype-by-environment interactions (GET) were also found. With the exception of 100-kernel weight, the ratio of GEI for the remaining three traits was lower than that of E and higher than that of G. GEI was decomposed, and the interaction information of PCA1 and PCA2 in the interaction of four traits was significant. Hengyul587 and Shiyu 1503 performed better than the other hybrids and were identified as excellent varieties across locations because of their outstanding performances according to a 2-year observation. The comprehensive utilization of the AM MI model and GGE biplot can enable the scientific and objective judgment of the high yield, stability, and adaptability of tested maize hybrids and provides theoretical support for the rational layout of maize hybrids in the environments of Hebei Province.

This study attempted to investigate the effects of grass root density on gully headcut erosion and morphological development of the gully head using plots with different grass root densities (with bare land as the control). The experiment was performed on plots with different grass root densities, and the rainfall intensity and inflow discharge increased throughout the experiment. The results showed that headcut migration in bare land was mainly activated by upstream flow incision, headwall erosion, and plunge pool erosion, whereas headcut migration in grassland was driven by soil-root matrix collapse at the headcut, headwall erosion, and plunge pool erosion. The soil loss rate (SLR), gully headcut retreat distance (GRD), gully area (GA), and upstream soil loss volume (SLVU) in grassland plots with different root densities were 45.64-68.45%, 66.97-85.38%, 69.26-78.18%, and 67.89-87.02% less than those in the bare land plots, respectively. However, as root density increased, the gully depth in the grassland plots increased from 19% to 59%, and the proportion of gully head soil loss volume (SLVGH) to the total soil loss volume increased from 63.37% to 88.37%. The SLR, GRD, GA, and SLVGH showed decreasing trends as the root density increased, as described by a Hill curve. Moreover, roots with diameters of 0-0.5 mm had greater effects on soil loss and morphological evolution than roots with larger diameters. Our results provide a reference for the reasonable selection of grass root density for controlling gully headcut erosion in China's Loess Plateau.

In this study, we determined the dynamic distribution of the soil salinity (SS) as well as its effects on maize (Zea mays L.) after rainstorm events in two land types produced by excavation and sediment deposition. Four treatments were tested comprising sediment deposited farmland without plastic mulch (S1) and with plastic mulch (S2), and excavated farmland without plastic mulch (E1) and with plastic mulch (E2). The results showed that the dynamic distribution of the SS exhibited similar characteristics included leaching, rapid accumulation, and relatively stability in the 0-40 cm soil layer after rainstorm events. A turning point where the leaching and accumulation of SS reached a balance in the 0-40 cm layer occurred on about the 4th day under the no plastic mulch treatments and on the 6th day under the plastic mulch treatments. The SS reached a relatively stable condition in the whole soil layer on the 12th day. Rainstorm events increased the accumulated SS by 0.36, 0.08, 0.44, and 0.20 g kg-1 under E1, E2, S1, and S2, respectively, during the year. Plastic mulch treatments decreased the average accumulated SS by 66.7% and the average SS by 22% by reducing water infiltration and soil evaporation. The average SS and accumulated SS in sediment deposited farmland were 8.9% and 47.6% higher, respectively, than those in excavated farmland because of the lower depth of the groundwater influence zone and more abundant capillary pores in the sediment deposited farmland. The average SS in the whole soil layer followed the order of: S1 (0.72 g kg-1) E1 (0.62 g kg-1) > E2 (0.53 g kg-1) > S2 (0.52 g kg-1) (P < 0.05), and these levels did not limit maize growth. However, the two land types without plastic mulch would be transformed into severe saline-alkali land after 10 years. Therefore, we conclude that E2 is the optimal treatment for this region because it resulted in the lowest accumulated SS. Our results are important for understanding the SS dynamics and controlling soil salinization after rainstorm events.

A total of 28 lambs (19.1 +/- 1.20 kg) were divided randomly into four dietary treatment groups and received alfalfa silage (1% BW on DM basis) and concentrate feed (2% BW on DM basis) plus: 1) sweet sorghum silage (SS); 2) sweet sorghum silage + grapeseeds (SSG); 3) sweet sorghum hay (SH); and 4) sweet sorghum hay + grapeseeds (SHG). Sweet sorghum silage and hay were offered ad libitum and grapeseeds, when offered, were added at 6% DM of concentrate feed, which was equivalent to approximately 2.7 % of total DMI. Grapeseeds did not affect DMI, but DMI of the silage groups were higher than the hay groups (P<0.05) and the ADG of SSG was higher than SH (P<0.05). Grapeseeds had no effect on rumen microbial protein yield, efficiency of microbial protein synthesis and excretion of urine purine derivatives. The SSG group had lower rumen fluid pH and acetate:propionate ratio but higher concentrations of total VFAs, acetate, propionate, butyrate, isovaleric acid and valerate than the other three groups (P<0.05). Supplementary grapeseeds did not affect ruminal bacteria diversity, but increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Prevotella 1 (P<0.01) and decreased Firmicutes (P<0.05). It was concluded that there was an increase in total VFAs and the relative abundances of ruminal bacteria were altered in lambs when sweet sorghum was supplemented with grapeseeds to the diet.

Increasing studies have evaluated the distribution and stock of soil P in natural terrestrial ecosystems, yet few studies explore the large-scale P distribution from the perspective of soil development in the mountain regions. In this study, 1254 soil samples, including organic soils (O horizon), surface mineral soils (A horizon) and parent materials (C horizon), were collected from twenty-nine mountains in China according to soil development conditions. The concentration and stock of total P in the soils were analyzed to decipher the effects of soil development along with other potential drivers on the P distribution. The results showed that total P concentration decreased significantly in the order of O horizon > A horizon > C horizon, whereas total P stock displayed an opposite trend. Spatially, soil total P concentration increased from South to North China and from West to East China, irrespective of soil horizons, whereas total P stock did not present a consistent spatial trend across the soil horizons. Climate, vegetation and atmospheric active nitrogen deposition exhibited negative effects on soil P distribution directly or indirectly by affecting pedogenesis, while soil organic carbon, pH and iron had distinctly positive effects on the P accumulation in specific horizon. The results highlight the importance of soil development on soil total P distribution in mountains, and this process should be considered when evaluating soil P dynamics in the P biogeochemical cycling models.

Nonetheless, the impact of the combination of warming and precipitation changes on all three major biogenic GHGs (CO2, CH4 and N2O) has not been synthesized, to build a global synthesis. In this study, we conducted a global meta-analysis concerning the effects of warming and precipitation changes and their interactions on soil GHG fluxes and explored the potential factors by synthesizing 39 published studies worldwide. Across all studies, combination of warming and increased precipitation showed more significant effect on CO2 emissions (24.0%) than the individual effect of warming (8.6%) and increased precipitation (20.8%). Additionally, warming increased N2O emissions (28. 3%), and decreased precipitation reduced CO2 (-8.5%) and N2O (-7.1%) emissions, while the combination of warming and decreased precipitation also showed negative effects on CO2 (-7.6%) and N2O (-14.6 %) emissions. The interactive effects of warming and precipitation changes on CO2 emissions were usually additive, whereas CO2 and N2O emissions were dominated by synergistic effects under warming and decreased precipitation. Moreover, climate, biome, duration, and season of manipulations also affected soil GHG fluxes as well. Furthermore, we also found the threshold effects of changes in soil temperature and moisture on CO2 and N2O emissions under warming and precipitation changes. The findings indicate that both warming and precipitation changes substantially affect GHG emissions and highlight the urgent need to study the effect of the combination of warming and precipitation changes on C and N cycling under ongoing climate change.					贾, 晓宇/AHB-0724-2022; Yan, Weiming/CAG-9069-2022	贾, 晓宇/0000-0001-6011-1472; Yan, Weiming/0000-0001-5509-0806													0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 25	2022	827								154351	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154351		MAR 2022						35259374					WOS:000790800200021

Here, we evaluate the anomalous APV-induced spring vegetation variability and lagged productivity responses in China. We found that both strong and weak APV conditions have almost equally negative impacts on spring vegetation growth in China, e.g., negative NDVI anomalies occurred in 48.6 and 53.2% of China's vegetated areas under strong and weak APV conditions, respectively. However, large seasonal compensation effects were associated with weak APV conditions, and beneficial lagged vegetation productivity responses occurred in 67.2% of China's vegetated areas, whereas adverse responses occurred in only 32.8% of vegetated areas. Under a strong APV, adverse lagged vegetation productivity responses occurred in 54.5% of China's vegetated areas, whereas beneficial responses occurred in only 45.5% of vegetated areas. The temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation changes caused by anomalous APV-induced changes in circulation patterns are the main reasons for spring vegetation variability. The lagged vegetation productivity responses were attributed to anomalous APV-related precipitation and air temperature anomalies in the following summer and autumn. This improved understanding of the strong links between APV anomalies and vegetation dynamics in China should facilitate early warning of vegetation productivity reductions under anomalous APV conditions.					wang, zhaosheng/AAX-1350-2021	wang, zhaosheng/0000-0001-7307-2249													0177-798X	1434-4483				JUL	2021	145	1-2					261	272		10.1007/s00704-021-03632-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-021-03632-x		APR 2021											WOS:000645220300001

Correction factor for rill flow velocity measured by the dye tracer method under varying rill morphologies and hydraulic characteristics	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Flow velocity is an important parameter for rill erosion process studies. The dye tracer method is the most widely used method for measuring rill flow velocity, but the influential factors and reasonable values of the correction factor alpha remain uncertain. Therefore, the experimental datasets from different studies were used to evaluate the a values from the previous studies could be applied to calculate the mean velocity of rill flow, and a detailed laboratory study was conducted to investigate the effects of rill morphology and hydraulic characteristics on the a of rill flow. The slope gradients varied from 5 to 25 degrees, flow discharges from 2 to 8 L min(-1), and Reynolds numbers from 172 to 1040. The surface velocity was measured by the dye tracer method, and the mean velocity was derived indirectly from the flow depth measurements. The results showed that a single alpha value was not suitable for rill flow velocity measurement. The alpha values of rill-free flow and rill flow ranged from 0.295 to 0.729 and from 0.330 to 0.990, respectively. The effect of the slope gradient on the alpha of rill-free flow was noticeably different from that of rill flow, and the alpha of this study increased with increasing Reynolds number. For the rill-free flow, alpha could be estimated with a logarithmic function of the slope gradient and Reynolds number (R-2 = 0.930, NSE = 0.930). For rill flow, a increased linearly with increasing rill width, depth and cross-sectional area. The value of alpha could be estimated with an equation of the rill depth and Reynolds number (R-2 = 0.811, NSE = 0.811). The results of this study provide a reference for rill flow velocity measurement using the dye tracer method.

Highly intensive livestock production often causes immune stress to animals, which makes them more susceptible to infections. The aim of this study was to examine whether resveratrol alleviates inflammation in lambs. Results showed that resveratrol attenuated the LPS-evoked inflammatory responses in lambs by suppressing expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and blocking NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways. Based on these studies, resveratrol has the potential to be a promising therapeutic reagent for multiple inflammatory illnesses caused by immune stress. Abstract: Highly intensive livestock production often causes immune stress to animals, which makes them more susceptible to infections. The aim of this study was to examine whether resveratrol (Res) alleviates inflammation in lambs. In Experiment 1, 16 male lambs were injected with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) at an initial dose of 0.25, 1.25, and 2.5 mu g/kg body weight (BW) for 9 days. Average daily gain and blood parameters were measured and clinical symptoms were recorded. In Experiment 2, 20 male lambs were injected intravenously with LPS (0 mg/kg) + Res (0 mg), LPS (2.5 mu g /kg) + Res (0 mg, 82.5 mg, 165 mg, 330 mg), 4 h after LPS injection. Jugular blood was collected from each lamb to determine white blood cell (WBC) counts and the expression of inflammatory genes. In Experiment 1, all LPS-treated lambs showed clinical signs of sickness including rhinorrhea, lethargy, and shivering, and systemic inflammatory responses of increased inflammatory genes levels and cortisol concentration. The lambs had increased respiratory and heart rates and rectal temperature and decreased average daily gain and feed intake. In Experiment 2, resveratrol significantly reduced WBCs and the expression levels of several genes associated with inflammation response (TLR4, NF-kappa B, c-jun) and inhibited the signaling cascades of NF-kappa B and MAPKs by down-regulating the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) induced by LPS. Resveratrol attenuated the LPS-evoked inflammatory responses in lambs by suppressing expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, and blocking NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling pathways.																			2076-2615					NOV	2019	9	11							872	10.3390/ani9110872	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani9110872								31661768					WOS:000502299900018

Effect of Supplemental Chromium, Vitamin E and Selenium on Biochemical and Physiological Parameters of Holstein Friesian Calves under Heat Stress	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL RESEARCH												Background: Heat stress has been a major concern in tropical, sub-tropical and arid areas affecting the performance of farm animals. Along with vitamin E and Selenium, chromium is gaining importance in combating heat stress. Methods: Twenty-four calves of 7-8 months old with an average body weight of 172.79 +/- 4.39 kg were distributed randomly into four dietary treatment groups (T-0, T-1, T-2 and T-3). The calves of control group (T 0 ) were fed on basal diet i.e. total mixed ration (TMR). The basal diet of T i , T 2 and T, on per kg DM basis were supplemented vitamin E (500 IU) + selenium (0.3 mg), chromium propionate (0.5 mg) and chromium propionate (0.5 mg) + vitamin E (500 IU) + selenium (0.3 mg), respectively. Ambient air temperature and humidity were measured for calculation of THI. Blood samples were collected fortnightly and the rectal temperature (RT), respiration rate (RR) and pulse rate (PR) of all the experimental animals were recorded twice daily to study the biochemical and physiological parameters. Result: Supplementation of chromium along with vitamin E and selenium decreased significantly (P<0.05) the cortisol levels and increased the albumin concentration. Chromium supplemented groups (T-2 and T-3) showed greater (P<0.05) increase in mean total protein concentration. A significant reduction in RT was observed in all the supplemented groups compared to control. Whereas, the PR and RR differed significantly in T-3 group compared to control.																			0367-6722					AUG	2022	56	8					921	927	B-4525	10.18805/IJAR.B-4525	http://dx.doi.org/10.18805/IJAR.B-4525													WOS:000841863500002

Herein, a global meta-analysis was conducted based on 898 pairwise observations to analyze the impact of nitrogen addition on plant-soil-enzyme C-N-P stoichiometry and microbial nutrient limitation in different ecosystem types (cropland, grassland, and forest), nitrogen addition intensity (0-5, 5-10, and >10 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) and duration (0-5, 5-10, and >10yr). Results showed that nitrogen addition significantly decreased plant C:N (shoot: 16.5%, root: 27.1%, litter: 16.5%), soil C:N (5.9%), enzyme C:P (1.2%), and enzyme N:P (5.1%), whereas significantly increased soil C:P (4.9%), enzyme C:N (7.1%), vector angle (4.4%), vector length (3.9%), and plant N:P (shoot: 24.1%, root: 23.8%, and litter: 13.5%). Furthermore, nitrogen addition mainly affected the enzyme C:N and vector length in grasslands. Additionally, the changes in C:N in plants, soil, and enzymes, and vector angle and length were higher at nitrogen addition intensity of >10 g N m(-2) yr(-1). The changes in C:N and C:P in plant and soil were higher at nitrogen addition duration of >10 yr. Finally, the N:P in shoot, soil and enzyme, and vector angle were strongly correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP). In conclusion, nitrogen addition significantly reduced the C:N ratio in plants and soil and increased plant N:P, and microbial C and P limitation. These effects vary with the ecosystem type, MAP, and nitrogen addition intensity and duration. The results improve our understanding of the plant-soil-microbial nutrient cycling processes in terrestrial ecosystems under global nitrogen deposition.

Field experiments were conducted in Tigray, Ethiopia during 2015 and 2016 to identify the most important agronomic traits of teff contributing to its weed competitive ability. A split plot design with three blocks was used considering hand weeding as the main plot and varieties as the subplot. Randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four blocks was used in the laboratory experiment. The highest potential allelopathic activity (PAA) and specific potential allelopathic activity (SPAA) were recorded from a local landrace with an average PAA value of 11.77% and SPAA value of 1.21%/mg respectively, when ryegrass was used as the model weed. 'Boset' had the highest average PAA value of 16.25% and an SPAA value of 1.53%/mg, when using radish as the model weed. The lowest PAA and SPAA values were recorded from 'DZ-Cr-387 ' when using ryegrass and radish as model weeds. Days to emergence, height, tiller no./plant, biomass yield, and PAA of the crop significantly contributed to the variance of the weed biomass, cover, and density. Hence, they were the most important agronomic traits enhancing the competitive ability of teff.																				2073-4395				JUN	2020	10	6							854	10.3390/agronomy10060854	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10060854													WOS:000551645300001

OBJECTIVE: Considering the need for protein-rich forages by local livestock operations and the environmental benefits of growing perennial legumes, we propose that an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-based system is worth introducing for field practice in the NCP. METHODS: An integrated evaluation was used in this four-year study to compare the agronomic, economic, and environmental performances of the following four cropping patterns: alfalfa monoculture (AA), alfalfa and silage maize intercropping with or without N input which is designed for local climate condition, maize monoculture with or without N input which is much-discussed as a resources-saving substitution and commonly practiced W M. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: W M obtained the highest aboveground dry matter (DM) productivity (P < 0.05) based on the highest irrigation water and N fertilizer consumption (P < 0.05) which caused considerable soil mineral N (Nmin) accumulation. The production cost of maize monoculture was the lowest as well as the DM yield, nitrogen accumulation and the net revenue compared with other systems (P < 0.05), moreover, there was a great risk of N losses during the offseason period. The alfalfa and silage maize intercropping with a low N input (120 kg ha-1 which is close to local practice for maize season) achieved 26.6%-34.9% more DM yield compared with AA and maize monoculture, and 12.5%-163.9% more N output compared with W M and maize monoculture during four experimental years with same total economic revenue as W M and AA did. The N input in alfalfa and silage maize intercropping dramatically improved the system productivity by assisting intercropped maize growth while did not lead to excessive Nmin accumulation within 0-210 soil layer compared with the intercropping system without N addition. The planting of alfalfa would not affect the water storage in the 0-60 soil layer after maize harvesting each year. For the effects of interspecific competition, the production of the intercropped alfalfa and maize was significantly decreased in 2020 and a three-year period of production is recommended for optimal use of the alfalfa and silage maize intercropping. SIGNIFICANCE: Alfalfa and silage maize intercropping with an appropriate N input, which acquired comprehensive performances in terms of productivity, environmental impacts as well as economic profits, would be an optimal alternative system in the NCP.

We evaluated the effects of different irrigation regimes on root vigor, root distribution, soil water, crop water productivity, GY, and WUE of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) on the Guanzhong Plain of the Yellow River Basin. Laboratory experiments on the hydroponic cultivation of winter wheat comprised control (CK-G, CK-B), magnetization (GM, BM) and oxidation (GO, BO) groups of groundwater and brackish water. Field experiments on the growth of winter wheat included control (IG), magnetization (IGM) and oxidation (IGO) groups of groundwater irrigation. Three irrigation levels, 60, 120 and 180 mm, were used for each treatment (IGM60, IGM120 and IGM180, and IGO60, IGO120 and IGO180, respectively). Under GM and GO regimes, the surface tension and viscosity coefficient of magnetized and oxidized water decreased compared with CK-G, for up to10 hours and 8 h, respectively. The mot vigor in winter wheat was 526 and 925 mu g g(-1) h(-1) after GM and GO treatment, respectively, which was 101% and 253% higher than CK-G. Under IGM120 and IGO120 regimes, mot length density at a soil depth of 0-20 cm increased by 23% and 24%, respectively, compared with IG, while the proportion of mot surface area density at a depth of 20-60 cm changed by 105% and 89%. GY (11.68 x10(3) kg ha(-1) and 10.72 x10(3) kg ha(-1)) and WUE (27.74 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) and 26.08 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) increased by 21% and 11%, and 21% and 14%, respectively. Between the greening and maturity growth stages, the available soil water storage in the 100-200 cm soil layer decreased by 68, 82 and 72 mm under the IG, IGM120 and IGO120 regimes, respectively. Fitted relationships between irrigation level and grain yield and the WUE indicated that 96 mm magnetized water irrigation was optimal for conserving water and increasing the efficiency of wheat irrigation on the Guanzhong Plain.					wang, yanhui/HPG-3348-2023; Wang, Li/AAE-6919-2022														0378-3774	1873-2283				JAN 1	2022	259								107254	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107254		OCT 2021											WOS:000711635400003

In this study, we evaluated the impact of human activity driven LULC changes on ESVs over the period 1982-2016/17 in contrasting agro-ecological environments: Guder (highland), Aba Gerima (midland), and Debatie (lowland) watersheds of the Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. Results During the study period, the continuous expansion of cultivated land at the expense of natural vegetation (bushland, forest, and grazing land) severely reduced the total ESV by about US$ 58 thousand (35%) in Aba Gerima and US$ 31 thousand (29%) in Debatie watersheds. In contrast, the unprecedented expansion of plantations, mainly through the planting of Acacia decurrens, led, from 2006, to a ESV rebound by about US$ 71 thousand (54%) in Guder watershed, after it had decreased by about US$ 61 thousand (32%) between 1982 and 2006. The reduction in natural forest area was the major contributor to the loss of total ESV in the study watersheds, ranging from US$ 31 thousand (63%) in Debatie to US$ 96.9 thousand (70%) in Guder between 1982 and 2016/17. On an area-specific basis, LULC changes reduced the average ESV from US$ 560 ha(-1) year(-1) (1982) in Guder to US$ 306 ha(-1) year(-1) (2017) in Debatie watersheds. Specific ESVs such as provisioning (mainly as food production) and regulating services (mainly as erosion control and climate regulation) accounted for most of the total ESVs estimated for the study watersheds. Conclusions In most cases, the total and specific ESVs of the watersheds were negatively associated with the population growth, which in turn was positively associated with the expansion of cultivated land over the study period. In Guder, however, ESVs were positively associated with population growth, especially after 2012. This is mainly due to the expansion of Acacia decurrens plantations. Our results suggest, therefore, that future policy measures and directions should focus on improving vegetation cover through planting multipurpose trees such as Acacia decurrens to prevent future loss of ESV in the midland and lowland regions of the Upper Blue Nile basin and beyond. However, caution must be taken during plantation of invasive species as they may have undesirable consequences.

Antisickling effect of chrysin is associated with modulation of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemglobin via alteration of functional chemistry and metabolic pathways of human sickle erythrocytes	HUMAN & EXPERIMENTAL TOXICOLOGY												Sickle cell disease (SCD) treatment and management remain a challenging puzzle especially among developing Nations. Chrysin's sickling-suppressive properties in human sickle (SS) erythrocytes in addition to its effect on AA-genotype erythrocytes were evaluated. Sickling was induced (76%) with 2% sodium metabisulphite at 3 h. Chrysin prevented (81.19%) the sickling and reversed same (84.63%) with strong IC(50)s (0.0257 mu M and 0.00275 mu M, respectively). The levels of oxygenated haemoglobin in the two groups (before and after induction approaches) were similar but significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of SS erythrocytes (the 'induced' control), with chrysin-treated AA-genotype showing no effects relative to the untreated. The level of deoxygenated haemoglobin in the 'induced' control group was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those of the chrysin-treated SS erythrocytes. Normal and chrysin-untreated erythrocytes (AA-untreated) were significantly more resistant to osmotic fragility than the SS-untreated. However, treatment with chrysin significantly reduced the osmotic fragility of the cells relative to the untreated cells. Furthermore, chrysin treatment significantly lowers the high level of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) observed in the sickle erythrocytes, with no effects on AA-genotype erythrocytes. Based on functional chemistry, chrysin treatment alters the functional groups in favour of its antisickling effects judging from the observed bends and shifts. From metabolomics analysis, it was observed that chrysin treatment favors fatty acid alkyl monoesters (FAMEs) production with concomitant shutting down-effects on selenocompound metabolism. Thus, sickling-suppressive effects of chrysin could potentially be associated with modulation of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemglobin via alteration of human sickle erythrocyte's functional chemistry and metabolic pathways implicated in SCD crisis.

Different plant species dominate in soils of different N concentrations. For example, more forbs occur in severely degraded alpine meadows than do sedges and Gramineae. We hypothesized that a more efficient uptake of low soil N by forbs than by sedges and Gramineae was the mechanism that allowed forbs to dominate. The amount and rate of soil N uptake and N allocation were determined in seven dominant alpine plant species using N-15 isotope tracer. The plants, which included one forb, Ajania tenuifolia, three sedges, Kobresia humilis, Carex scabrirostris, and Carex enervis, and three Gramineae, Elymus nutans, Festuca sinensis, and Stipa purpurea, were maintained in pots with four different N concentrations (0, 50, 100, and 150 kg ha(-1)). The forb had the highest efficiency of N utilization (N uptake rate, 60.4%) in low N soil concentration, the Gramineae had intermediate efficiencies (27.9-47.9%), and the sedges had the lowest efficiencies (5.2-34.9%), and, consequently, our hypothesis was supported. N utilization of the seven species decreased with an increase in soil N concentration, from 32.1% at N50 to 18.0% at N150, which indicated that soil N uptake by plants was affected by soil N concentration. The mechanism used by forbs to be the dominant species in severely degraded alpine meadows was a more efficient utilization of soil N than Gramineae and sedges in conditions of low soil N. We concluded that plant species have different efficiencies in soil N uptake and utilization, which allow them to adapt and survive in habitats of different soil nutrition levels. These results implied that forbs should be reduced, and that Gramineae and sedges should be planted and N be added during the restoration and development of severely degraded grasslands on the Tibetan plateau when the soil N content is low.					li, xiao/GSN-6181-2022; ZHANG, TAO/ITV-6162-2023	Degen, Allan/0000-0003-4563-6195													1085-3278	1099-145X				JUN	2020	31	10					1265	1276		10.1002/ldr.3555	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3555		FEB 2020											WOS:000510781200001
J	Xu, XM; Wilson, GV; Zheng, FL; Tang, QH				Xu, Ximeng; Wilson, Glenn V.; Zheng, Fenli; Tang, Qiuhong			The role of soil pipe and pipeflow in headcut migration processes in loessic soils	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Headcut formation and migration was sometimes mistaken as the result of overland flow, without realizing that the headcut was formed and being influenced by flow through soil pipes into the headcut. To determine the effects of the soil pipe and flow through a soil pipe on headcut migration in loessic soils, laboratory experiments were conducted under free drainage conditions and conditions of a perched water table. Soil beds with a 3-cm deep initial headcut were formed in a flume with a 1.5-cm diameter soil pipe 15 cm below the bed surface. Overland flow and flow into the soil pipe was applied at a constant rate of 68 and 1 l min(-1)at the upper end of the flume. The headcut migration rate and sediment concentrations in both surface (channel) and subsurface (soil pipe) flows were measured with time. The typical response was the formation of a headcut that extended in depth until an equilibrium scour hole was established, at which time the headcut migrated upslope. Pipeflow caused erosion inside the soil pipe at the same time that runoff was causing a scour hole to deepen and migrate. When the headcut extended to the depth of the soil pipe, surface runoff entering the scour hole interacted with flow from the soil pipe also entering the scour hole. This interaction dramatically altered the headcut processes and greatly accelerated the headcut migration rates and sediment concentrations. Conditions in which a perched water table provided seepage into the soil pipe, in addition to pipeflow, increased the sediment concentration by 42% and the headcut migration rate by 47% compared with pipeflow under free drainage conditions. The time that overland flow converged with subsurface flow was advanced under seepage conditions by 2.3 and 5.0 min compared with free drainage conditions. This study confirmed that pipeflow dramatically accelerates headcut migration, especially under conditions of shallow perched water tables, and highlights the importance of understanding these processes in headcut migration processes.

However, how root exudates affect the rhizosphere microorganisms and soil nutrients of toxic plants in degraded grasslands remains unknown. We compared the interaction of soil microbial communities, root exudates, microbial carbon metabolism, and envi-ronmental factors in the rhizosphere of toxic and non-toxic plants. Deterministic processes had a greater effect on toxic than non-toxic plants, as root exudates affected rhizosphere microorganisms directly. The 328 up-regulated compounds in root exudates of toxic plants affected the diversity of rhizosphere microorgan-isms. Rhizosphere bacteria-enriched enzymes were involved in the phenylpropa-noid biosynthesis pathway. Root exudates of toxic plants form complex networks of rhizosphere microorganisms, provide high rhizosphere nutrients, and increase microbial carbon metabolism. The interaction between root exudates and rhizo-sphere microorganisms is the key mechanism that enables toxic plants to spread in degraded grassland habitats.

This study was conducted to quantify the effects of vegetation restoration on the soil erodibility of carbonate-derived laterite in karst areas. Experiments were conducted at two representative sites for different years of vegetation restoration. Six karst mountain land use types [grassland (Y1), shrubland (Y2) and woodland (Y3) in young forest (YF); forest trails (O1), shrubland (O2) and woodland (O3) in old forest (OF)]. A structural equation model and random forest regression analysis were applied to distinguish the key environmental factors dominating soil erodibility. The results showed that the soil erodibility K factor exponentially decreased with increasing restoration age and tended to remain stable after 20 years (y = 0.0466 + 0.0316e(-0.2889x), R-2 = 0.98). The K factor in the OF decreased by an average of 2.1%-14.8% compared to those in the YF. A structural equation model indicated that vegetation restoration indirectly reduced soil erodibility by altering plant growth and coverage and its associated soil property changes. A random forest regression analysis of global datasets indicated that soil erodibility is mainly affected by topographical factors (i.e., latitude, elevation and slope), and their mean decrease accuracy values (IncMSE) exceeded 20%. Both forestland and shrubland were not considered as the most important factors for affecting global soil erodibility. Conversely, grassland, cropland and bare land were among the important factors. These results could guide the potential benefits of vegetation restoration strategies to meet soil conservation and ecosystem function goals in karst mountain ecosystems.

Safe and efficient use of saline water resources is thus urgently required. To reveal the effects of different salinities of irrigation water on the yield and soil quality of mulched drip-irrigated cotton, a field experiment was conducted from 2017 to 2019. Five salinity levels of irrigation water were included: 1.3 (T1, control), 5.4 (T2), 8.8 (T3), 12.4 (T4) and 15.9 (T5) dS.m(-1). The results showed that the harvesting density and seed cotton yield increased first and then decreased with increasing salinity of irrigation water. Saline water irrigation with salinity < 8.8 dS.m(-1) did not lead to salt accumulation in the main root zone (0-60 cm) with each passing year but a decrease of salt in 2018. In the third year of saline water irrigation, with the increase in irrigation water salinity, the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract (ECe), soil sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), pH and bulk density (BD) in the plow layer gradually increased. However, the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), water stable macroaggregate (> 0.25 mm) content, catalase (CAT) and urease (URE) activity decreased with increasing salinity. Moreover, the soil organic carbon (SOC) content and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity increased first and then decreased. Irrigation water salinity < 5.4 dS.m(-1) had no significant effect on most physicochemical properties, such as pH, SOC content, BD, Ks, water stable aggregate content and activities of CAT, URE and ALP. Compared with the T1 treatment, the soil quality index (SQI) of T2, T3, T4 and T5 treatments decreased by 1.2%, 10.5%, 16.5% and 23.7%, respectively. Considering cotton yield, soil salt accumulation and SQI, mulched drip irrigation is conducive to the sustainability of cotton with saline water levels below 5.4 dS.m(-1).					zhang, wb/JGM-5316-2023; Feng, Di/HII-8952-2022; jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023	Feng, Di/0000-0002-1406-2611; 													0378-3774	1873-2283				MAR 31	2022	262								107405	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107405													WOS:000788796200011

Soil microbes are crucial in regulating the direction and magnitude of the priming effect. In the present study, we performed metagenomic sequencing and 13C-glucose labeling analyses of microbial communities and priming effects across a Robinia pseudoacacia afforestation chronosequence (14-, 20-, 30-, and 45-year-old stands) in the Loess Plateau in China, with adjacent farmland being selected as a control. Our results revealed that the cumulative priming effect across five sites along the afforestation chronosequence initially increased and approached a peak value in the 20year-old stand, after which it declined. The priming effect was predominantly driven by the microbial community structure (i.e., the fungal-to-bacterial ratios and relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria), and stable C decomposition genes and C-degrading enzymes. Specifically, among the key functional genes correlated with priming effect, which were identified in orders Rhizobiales and Pseudonocardiales, considerably promoted SOC priming. Overall, our findings indicate that afforestation alters soil microbial community structure and function, particularly with respect to enhancing stable soil C decomposition genes, which may promote SOC priming. The findings of the present study could enhance our understanding of fresh C input-induced changes associated with C mineralization in the context of the revegetation of ecologically fragile areas.

Cadmium has toxic effects on the kidneys, bones, and respiratory system. Prenatal exposure to cadmium has been found to affect the mental development of children, but inconsistent results have been found in different studies. Therefore, it is unknown that prenatal cadmium exposure associated with child development after birth. To elucidate whether cadmium affect the child development or not, we analyzed nation-wide cohort study data, the Japan Environment and Children's Study. Prenatal cadmium concentrations in blood from mothers in the second or third trimester were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Child development was evaluated using "Ages and Stages" questionnaires. The association between cadmium and child development were investigated by performing logistic regression analyses, multinomial logistic regression analyses and generalized linear mixed model using the child development parameters as dependent variables and the cadmium concentrations in maternal blood as the independent variable. There were significant associations between the cadmium concentration and child development at 6 months, 1 year, and 1.5 years after birth. However, the effect had disappeared at 2 years after birth or later. The number of developmental delays was positively associated with the cadmium concentration after adjusting individual difference. The results indicate that prenatal exposure affects child development, but the effect decreases with age.

Towards moss biocrust effects on surface soil water holding capacity: Soil water retention curve analysis and modeling	GEODERMA												As ecosystem engineers in drylands, biocrusts possibly generate great influences on surface soil water holding capacity and availability, but these effects have not yet been sufficiently investigated, especially through analyzing and modeling their soil water retention curve (SWRC). On the Loess Plateau of China, the naturally developed moss biocrusts and surface bare soil were sampled in five replicates on loess soil and aeolian sand respectively, and their SWRCs from saturation (soil water potential = 0 hPa) to dry (soil water potential = 15,000 hPa) were measured with a sandbox (low water potential range) in combination with a pressure plate (high water potential range). The measured SWRCs were compared to the van Genuchten (VG), Brooks and Corey (BC), and Log-Normal Distribution (LND) models, and the model with best performance was adopted to further determine the effects of biocrusts on surface soil water holding capacity and water availability through comparing the differences in soil water content (theta) at specific water potentials between the biocrusts and uncrusted soil. Our results showed that (i) the biocrusts always had higher. as compared with the bare soil across the whole water potential range, and the increasing effects of the biocrusts was much stronger on aeolian sand (165%) in comparison to that on loess soil (15%). (ii) As compared with the bare soil, the saturated water content, field capacity, wilting point, and available water content of the aeolian sand increased by 52%, 256% (0.192 vs. 0.054 cm(3) cm(-3)), 65%, and 1000% by the biocrusts, respectively; while that of the loess soil increased by 28%, 9% (0.240 vs.0.220 cm(3) cm(-3)), 27%, and 8% by the biocrusts, respectively. (iii) The increased water holding capacity of the biocrusts was possibly attributed to their higher percentage (18% vs. 16%) of microscopic pores (0.3-5 mu m) on the loess soil and their increasing (16% vs. 1%) microscopic pores and decreasing (18% vs. 50%) medium pores (30-75 mu m) on the aeolian sand. (iv) The VG and LND models performed better (R-2 > 0.98, RMSE <= 0.019 cm(3) cm(-3), RE <= 7.4%) than the BC model in simulating the SWRCs of the biocrusts and bare soil, and their fitting errors were mostly distributed in the high (-500 to -1000 hPa) and low (<-5000 hPa) water potential ranges. As indicated by SWRCs, we conclude that biocrusts greatly increase surface soil water holding capacity and water availability, leading in turn to a positive feedback mechanism of the biocrusted layer, which may affect surface hydropedological process (e.g., infiltration and evaporation) in drylands.

The F-box protein COI1, which plays a central role in JA signal transduction, perceives the JA signal and is required for all the JA-mediated defense responses against biotic and abiotic stresses. JA signaling elements including COI1 have been extensively investigated in Arabidopsise. However, the elements of the JA signaling pathway in maize are largely unknown. In this study, we identified four F-box protein genes from the maize genome, which share high homology with AtCOI1, designated as ZmCOI1a, ZmCOI1b, ZmCOI1c, and ZmCOI2, collectively ZmCOIs. To test whether or not the homologous genes of maize are functionally conservative in JA signaling, we over-expressed ZmCOIs in the Arabidopsis coi1-1 mutant. The results showed that over-expression of ZmCOI1a, ZmCOI1b or ZmCOI1c in the coi1-1 mutant resulted in the restoration of male fertility, indicating successful complementation of coi1-1 sterility by ZmCOI1a, ZmCOI1b, and ZmCOI1c. However, ZmCOI2 was not able to restore male fertility of the mutant, indicating that ZmCOI2 has a function diverged from JA signaling. Furthermore, over-expression of the ZmCOI1a, ZmCOI1b, and ZmCOI1c genes, except ZmCOI2, which, in the coi1-1 mutant, caused restoration of resistance to the leaf pathogen Botrytis cinerea and the soil-borne pathogen Pythium aristosporum. In addition, a set of JA-dependent genes are highly induced by wounding in the transformants of ZmCOIa, ZmCOI1b, and ZmCOI1c, but not inducible in transformants of ZmCOI2 or in the coi1-1 mutant, indicating that ZmCOIa, ZmCOI1b, and ZmCOI1c, except ZmCOI2, which can compensate coi1-1 mutation of Arabidopsis for the stress defense response. Putting all the data together, our results suggested that ZmCOIa, ZmCOI1b, and ZmCOI1c, but not ZmCOI2, act as AtCOI1 orthologues in maize for JA signal transduction.					yan, yuanxin/G-9523-2011														0721-7595	1435-8107				JUN	2019	38	2					479	493		10.1007/s00344-018-9863-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-018-9863-2													WOS:000471637400010

We explored an integrated management practice called strip deep rotary with staggered planting (SRS) which includes comprehensive technology for both canopy layers and topsoil. Here, field experiments were conducted under two maize cropping systems (spring maize and summer maize) to evaluate the effect of SRS on the spatial distribution of the canopy and roots for maize under high planting density (90,000 plants ha(-1)) and to determine the physiological factors involved in yield formation. Compared with conventional management practices (no-tillage with single planting, NTS), SRS decreased the LAI of the middle to top layers while improving the light distribution of the middle and lower layers by 72.99% and 84.78%, respectively. Meanwhile, SRS increased the root dry weight density and root sap bleeding by 51.26% and 21.77%, respectively, due to the reduction in soil bulk density by an average of 5.08% in the 0-40 cm soil layer. SRS improved the SPAD in the ear and lower leaves and maximized the LAD, which was conducive to dry matter accumulation (DMA), increasing it by 14.02-24.16% compared to that of NTS. As a result, SRS increased maize grain yield by 6.71-25.44%. These results suggest that strip deep rotary combined with staggered planting noticeably optimized the distribution of light in the canopy and reduced the soil bulk density to promote root vitality and growth, to maintain canopy longevity, and to promote the accumulation of dry matter, which eventually increased the grain yield of the maize under high planting density conditions. Therefore, SRS can be considered a better choice for the sustainable high yield of maize under high-density planting conditions in the NCP and similar areas throughout the world.					yang, rui/JHI-3328-2023	Ding, Zaisong/0009-0004-8125-8085; Zhou, Baoyuan/0000-0003-0979-4460														2223-7747				MAY 16	2023	12	10							2000	10.3390/plants12102000	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants12102000								37653918					WOS:000997353400001

Therefore, spectral reflectance was measured with a spectroradiometer (lambda 350-2500 nm) to predict grain yield (GY) and aboveground biomass yield (ABY) of teff and finger millet in Ethiopia. We calculated six spectral vegetation indices (SVIs): enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference VI (NDVI), soil-adjusted VI (SAVI), green (GNDVI), green chlorophyll VI (GCVI), and simple ratio (SR). Linear regression models fitted validation data with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.73, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.11 for teff GY, R-2 of 0.45 and RMSE of 0.52 for teff ABY, R-2 of 0.92 and RMSE of 0.22 for finger millet GY, and R-2 of 0.90 and RMSE of 0.24 for finger millet ABY.

Firmicutes (26.67%) and Chloroflexi (23.33%) were the most widely distributed phyla. Under all antibiotic treatments, the relative abundances of Bacillaceae, Streptosporangiaceae, Limnochordaceae, and Peptostreptococcaceae increased during the composting process. Moreover, norank_SBR1031, Planococcaceae, Thermomonosporaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Limnochordaceae, and Clostridiaceae_1 were the families showing the most significant differences across all treatments (p < 0.05). Principal co-ordinates analysis indicated that the family composition in the ciprofloxacin treatment significantly differed from the other treatments. The presence of ciprofloxacin increased both the abundance and diversity of the bacterial community (the Chao index changed from 588.44 to 680.17, and the Shannon index changed from 3.41 to 4.06) in the end of composting. Crocinitomicaceae dominated (relative abundance of 79.10%) among the unique families in the ciprofloxacin treatment. Network analysis indicated that ciprofloxacin altered the synergistic or competitive relationships between different families (norank_SBR1031 and Microscillaceae), leading to different bacterial community composition compared with other treatments. Further, a structural equation model showed that the C:N ratio was significantly negatively correlated with the bacterial community (lambda = -0.869, p < 0.01), whereas pH showed a direct, significant positive relationship with the bacterial community (lambda = 0.701, p < 0.01), especially in ciprofloxacin treatment. Overall, ciprofloxacin significantly influenced the physical and chemical properties of composting, altered the bacterial community structure. These findings have important implications for a better understanding of the effects of antibiotic types on bacterial community structure and the involved mechanisms during swine manure composting.

However, in 2019-2020, with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply of commercial milk was disrupted, and the local smallholder dairy farmers played an important role in stabilizing food and nutritional security in rural, arid areas of China. The aim of this study was to describe and understand the operation of smallholder dairy farms and suggest what improvements are needed. We interviewed 45 smallholder dairy farmers from Gansu Province. A questionnaire was used to collect information on the dairy operation, including, number of cows, cow breeds, feed offered, milk yield and on management and open-ended discussions on the needs of the farmers to improve their dairies. Feed samples were collected at each farm to determine composition and milk samples were collected to analyze for composition and fatty acid content, and to compare the quality with commercial milk. Smallholder farmers generally fed dairy cows local, low-quality forages, mainly wheat straw and corn stover (CS/WS), and the milk yield was low, however, milk had a high content of beneficial unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Milk from smallholder farms had lower concentrations of undesirable saturated fatty acids, higher concentrations of beneficial unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a lower atherogenic index than commercial milk. Proper sanitation measures and veterinary care were often lacking in these remote areas, leading to high somatic cell counts (SCC). A modified version of grounded theory was used to construct categories of what the farmers perceived was needed to improve their dairies. Four categories emerged in the following order: 1) equipment and management, 2) government support, 3) better cows, and 4) better feed. In a follow-up survey in 2020 of 18 farmers, conditions generally remained the same, including feed offered the animals, which would indicate that the milk composition remained the same. It was concluded that smallholder dairy farmers can provide food and nutritional security, especially for local residents in remote, rural, arid areas, but improvements in facilities, management, feed, cow breeds and sanitation are needed. Government subsidies should be implemented to help the smallholder dairy farmers. Results from this study provide information for local governments in their decision-making policies to stabilize smallholder dairies.

In this study, we assessed the direct and indirect effect of two EEs (perennial shrubs and ant nests), individually and combined, on the composition and function of arid soil bacterial communities. To that end, topsoil samples were collected in the Negev desert highlands during the dry season from four patch types: (1) barren soil; (2) under shrubs; (3) near ant nests; or (4) near ant nests situated under shrubs. The bacterial community composition and potential functionality were evaluated in the soil samples (14 replicates per patch type) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing together with physico-chemical measures of the soil. We have found that the EEs affected the community composition differently. Barren patches supported a soil microbiome, dominated by Rubrobacter and Proteobacteria, while in EE patches Deinococcus-Thermus dominated. The presence of the EEs similarly enhanced the abundance of phototrophic, nitrogen cycle, and stress-related genes. In addition, the soil characteristics were altered only when both EEs were combined. Our results suggest that arid landscapes foster unique communities selected by patches created by each EE(s), solo or in combination. Although the communities' composition differs, they support similar potential functions that may have a role in surviving the harsh arid conditions. The combined effect of the EEs on soil microbial communities is a good example of the hard-to-predict non-additive features of arid ecosystems that merit further research.

The coexisting inorganic colloids with a variety of active sites can selectively adsorb humic substances and thus affect the availability and mobility of organic matter. To investigate the selective adsorption of organic matter by coexisting inorganic colloids, humic acid (JGHA) extracted from soil, a kaolinite and goethite synthetic association (KGA) and a kaolinite and goethite mixture (KGM) were prepared and studied. With the adsorption expressed in mu mol m(-2), the adsorption affinity of JGHA on KGA (initial slope of isotherms) was slightly higher than that on KGM, although KGM could adsorb more JGHA molecules at larger JGHA concentrations. At pH 4, JGHA was adsorbed on the kaolinite edges and goethite through electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange, and on the kaolinite siloxane plates through hydrophobic interaction. At pH 6 and 8, the adsorption occurred only on the kaolinite siloxane plates and goethite. The overall average adsorption Gibbs energies were moderately negative, and comprised a strongly negative average overall molar entropy and a negative average overall molar entropy contribution. Thus, overall JGHA adsorption on KGA and KGM was enthalpy controlled. The large exothermic enthalpy gains and entropy losses were a result of electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange. The entropy gains because of hydrophobic attraction between JGHA and the kaolinite siloxane plates are masked by the larger entropy loss of adsorption on the hydrophilic surfaces. The fractions of JGHA with molar mass >similar to 12.9 kDa (1 Da = 1 g mol(-1)) were adsorbed selectively by KGM, whereas the fractions <similar to 12.9 kDa were selectively adsorbed by KGA. High molar mass and hydrophobic fractions adsorb selectively on the kaolinite siloxane plates, whereas low molar mass fractions with hydrophilic groups adsorb selectively on goethite and the kaolinite edges. Highlights Selective adsorption behaviour of HA on binary systems containing kaolinite and goethite. High molar mass and hydrophobic HA fractions selectively adsorb on kaolinite siloxane plates. Low molar mass and hydrophilic HA fractions selectively adsorb on kaolinite edges and goethite. Binding affinity of HA to KGA is stronger than to KGM; mineral associations are more beneficial for fixing OM in soil.

In such climates, the cooling effect of green roofs can also be important on warm days during the winter. In this study, we compared temperatures of non-green roofs, green roofs planted with Sedum sediforme (Jacq.) Pau, and green roofs planted with the same density of Sedum together with annual plants. These plants were chosen because annual plant communities are an important part of semi-arid environments, which are analogous to green roofs. Temperatures were measured below green roof plots and in the substrate. We found that temperatures below green roofs were around 7 degrees C cooler than below non-green roofs, and that temperatures below Sedum roofs were, in general, 1.5 degrees C cooler than below annuals + Sedum roofs. The difference in temperatures between green roofs types was seen in summer in the substrate and in winter below the roof. Substrate moisture was higher in Sedum roofs in the summer. Vegetation cover was higher in annuals + Sedum roofs in winter and in Sedum roofs in summer, as Sedum grown alone grew more than Sedum grown with annuals. Overall, Sedum roofs appear to be more effective in providing cooling benefits in this climate, due to higher substrate moisture and vegetation cover in the summer. Thus, to achieve the cooling benefits of an extensive green roof in a Mediterranean climate, it may be prudent to use succulent species alone, without annuals that would compete with Sedum in winter, while not providing a cooling effect in summer.

This paper focuses on the aspirations of farm parents and their children in agriculture, the challenges they confront, and potential solutions. We draw on qualitative data from two rural sites in Southern India, different from each other in their agro-ecological and social contexts, to point to the material, social, relational, and structural factors shaping aspirations. First, agrarian distress, resulting from climate variability and market uncertainty, affects farm households' socioeconomic status, resulting in farmers' aspiration failure in agriculture. Farm parents then focus on educating their children, aspiring for secure non-farm jobs for their sons, and finding suitable marriage partners, also in non-farm employment, for their daughters. While this steer from parents discourages youth from aspiring to careers in agriculture, in reality, there is a wide gap in the achievement of aspirations, and a majority of youth, especially young women, do end up working on their family farms. For the future development of agriculture and sustainable food systems, it is essential to protect young farmers from aspiration failures and innovate through appropriate policies.

However, the effects of DRW of different intensities on the microbial properties and respiration are not well understood. Thus, the responsive patterns of microbial communities and carbon mineralization in agriculture soil on the Chinese Loess Plateau to DRW treatments with different wetting intensities (5%-25% and 5%-36%) and frequency (1-cycle to 4-cycle) were investigated. Continuous moisture levels of 5%, 25% and 36% were used as control. Results revealed that the reduction of bacterial diversity and richness were greater for 5%-36% than 5%-25% treatment, while diversity of fungi was similar for different wetting intensities. Bacterial communities became clustered by wetting intensity rather than cycle number, however fungal community was unaffected by DRW. The complexity of bacterial co-occurrence network increased because of higher nodes, edges, average degree, diameter and average cluster coefficient after 4-cycles, and the interaction was more complex after 1-cycle for fungi. Rewetting caused a pulse-like increase of respiration rate, and the pulse amplitude was greater for DRW with high rewetting intensity and decreased with the increase of cycle number. The cumulative CO2 emission for DRW treatments was lower than that for the continuous moisture conditions. The net reduction of carbon release for 5%-36% treatment was 1.18 times higher than that for 5%-25% treatment. Our study provides experimental evidence of the positive potential of DRW processes for maintaining soil carbon stock in an agriculture system on the Loess Plateau.

To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted an in-situ simulation experiment using five precipitation gradients (natural precipitation, increased and decreased by 40%, and 80%) in a natural restoration grassland for three years. The composition of soil fungal communities and their functions were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing techniques. Although the change of precipitation did not change the diversity index of soil fungi, it changed the composition and function of dominant fungal community groups. Specifically, decreased precipitation resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of Dothideomycetes and Boeremia by up to 12.17% and 9.93%, respectively, while these decreased with increased precipitation. The abundance of Basidiomycota, Glomeromycota, and Agaricomycetes abundance decreased by up to 11.27%, 6.96%, and 11.46% with decreased precipitation, but also decreased by up to 10.9%, 1.73%, and 10.51% with increased precipitation, respectively. However, the abundance of Ascomycota, Pezizomycetes, and norank_Pezizales increased by up to 22.58%, 7.45%, and 6.95% with decreased precipitation, and increased by up to 12.05%, 8.43%, and 5.81% with increased precipitation, respectively. The number of dominant fungal groups with interactive relationships weakened by 34.93% and 8.7% under decreased precipitation by 80% and increased 80%, respectively. Precipitation change had no significant effect on the proportion of saprotrophs, while a decrease of precipitation increased the endophyte-plant pathogens by up to 58.0% and decreased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi by up to 92.6%. In brief, the dominant soil fungal communities could adapt and respond to climate change by altering the proportion of different dominant fungal groups by responding to moisture patterns with changes in the interrelationships between microbial communities and the proportional distribution of functional groups.

However, the heterogeneity of thinning intensity, recovery stage, and microclimatic conditions increases uncertainty about the effect of thinning on SOC. The activities of Cdegrading enzymes (ligninases and cellulases) secreted by soil microorganisms can be used to explore the effects of thinning on soil C storage. Our meta-analysis showed that forest thinning significantly increased soil temperature (ST), soil moisture (SM), and pH, but significantly decreased litter and fine root biomass. Moderate thinning and recovery time extension increased soil C storage, SOC, and recalcitrant organic C (ROC). An increase in the thinning intensity significantly improved ligninase activity, while decreasing cellulase activity and extending recovery time after thinning. Increased SOC, soil labile organic C (LOC), and ROC with thinning were associated with increased ligninase activity that was significantly positively correlated with soil pH, SM, and ST after thinning. The variation in soil ligninase: cellulase ratio induced by thinning was significantly positively correlated with the increases of soil ROC: LOC ratio and SOC after thinning. Therefore, forest thinning enhanced SOC pool stability through the effect of ligninases and cellulases on SOC sequestration. The global pattern of soil C-degrading enzymes in response to thinning has deepened our understanding of the mechanism by which thinning affects the SOC cycle.					chen, yan/JRY-4645-2023; Zhang, Wei/JOJ-8390-2023; zhao, hang/JVM-8270-2024	Zhang, Wei/0000-0003-2017-5564; Xu, Miaoping/0000-0002-9896-7919													0341-8162	1872-6887				NOV	2022	218									10.1016/j.catena.2022.106560	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106560													WOS:000910989900003

However, knowledge remains limited about how the soil biotic and abiotic properties drive changes in plant community composition and diversity after nitrogen (N) addition. In this study, four N addition rates (N0, N3, N6, and N9: 0, 3, 6, and 9 g N m (-2) yr(-1)) were applied to a grassland community on the Loess Plateau (China) to evaluate the response of plant community biomass, evenness, and composition to N addition. Overall, N addition significantly increased plant shoot and root biomass by 27.75%-31.37% and 39.60%-65.42% compared with N0, but no significant difference was observed among N3, N6, and N9. N addition significantly decreased shoot/root biomass ratio by 7.17%-21.84%, and plant community evenness by 3.80%-8.80% compared with N0, particularly under N3 and N6 treatments. Furthermore, N addition enhanced the abundance of bacteria and fungi, but their composition was not altered. Responses of plant biomass and evenness to N addition were correlated to changes in NO3--N, soil total phosphorus, and the abundance of bacteria and fungi; additionally, the composition was primarily affected by the microbial abundance. Our research indicates that N addition can significantly alter plant community composition, particularly at low addition rates, and such alteration may be more affected by the soil microbial abundance. The findings of this study have important implications for the sustainable management of grassland ecosystems.

Effect of local watershed landscapes on the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the waterbodies of reservoir bays	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Reservoir bays, which are affected by the reservoir and watershed characteristics, are the initial and most sensitive areas in the evolution process of reservoir water quality. However, the relationship between the watershed characteristics and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in reservoir bays is poorly understood. We selected 66 bays from the Danjiangkou Reservoir and sampled twice per year (storage and discharge periods) from 2015 to 2018 to monitor the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the waterbodies of the reservoir bays. Four types of watershed characteristic indices (topographic variables, soil variables, land-use composition, and landscape patterns) around these bays were obtained. We quantified the relationship between the DI and TP concentrations and watershed characteristics in the waterbodies of the reservoir bays using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results showed that the mean concentrations of TN and TP in the storage period (TN:1.69 mg.L-1, TP:0.088 mg.L-1) were higher than those in the discharge period (TN:1.22 mg.L-1, TP:0.063 mg.L-1). The optimal PLSR models explained 67.9% and 82.5% of the TN concentration variability, and 65.4% and 67.2% of the TP concentration variability during the storage and discharge period, respectively. Based on the variable importance in the projection (VIP) values, soil erodibility had significant effects on the TN and TP concentrations. The key factors affecting the TN concentration were the slope gradient, basin relief, topographic wetness index, forest and agricultural land use, whereas the factors controlling the TP concentration were the landscape shape index, edge density, Shannon's diversity index and grass land use, although the TP concentration was also controlled by the patch density and contagion during the storage period, and by mean patch size and largest patch index during the discharge period. This study provides critical insights into sustainable landscape planning and effective reservoir water quality management. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study is to quantify the effects of gravity erosion on soil loss, especially the changes of particle size distribution of the suspended sediment. Materials and methods In this study, experiments were conducted in a field mobile laboratory in which mass movements were triggered on steep slopes under simulated rainfall. During the experiments, water-sediment samples were collected in polyethylene bottles directly from the gully and channel flows before and during the mass movements. The volumes of each mass failure during and 20 min after the rainfalls were measured by a topography meter. The particle fractions of the samples were analyzed by combining the sieving and photoelectric sedimentometer techniques. A suite of indexes such as median sediment size (d(50)), sediment heterogeneity (H), fractal dimension (D), and enrichment/dilution ratio (R-ed) were then used to evaluate the effect of mass movement on PSDSS. Results and discussion (1) Gravity erosion had a significant influence on PSDSS. After the mass movements occurred, the proportion of sand-sized particles was decreased from 71 to 51%, whereas the proportions of clay and silt were increased from 1 to 7% and 28 to 42%, respectively. (2) The d(50), H, and D were significantly correlated with slope failures. The d(50) was decreased from 0.084 to 0.051 mm, whereas the H and D were increased from 5.6 to 26.8 and from 2.60 to 2.78, respectively. This implies that mass movements make the PSDSS more nonuniform and irregular. (3) The suspended sediment tended to be enriched in the silt and clay fractions and diluted in the sand fractions after mass movements. R(ed)s for clay, slit, and sand fractions were 13.9, 1.4, and 0.7 respectively. Conclusions The changes of PSDSS after mass movements reflected a combined complex effect of soil sources, erosion types, selective detachment, and deposition processes. Mass movements led to a drastic increase of sediment concentration and the enrichment of fine particles, which developed into hyperconcentrated flows.					zhang, yuyang/IVV-5089-2023; Zhang, Hw/HPD-4999-2023; Zhang, Yunxuan/IXD-9283-2023														1439-0108	1614-7480				MAR	2020	20	3					1730	1741		10.1007/s11368-019-02496-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-019-02496-z		NOV 2019											WOS:000498948800004

Analysis of long-term patterns in soil erosion and lake deposition in a basin can provide the basis for untangling the complexities of climate and anthropogenic forcings. In this paper, sedimentary sequences from Xingyun Lake are compared with simulated soil erosion rates in the basin to explore the relationship between river basin soil erosion and lake deposition during the Holocene in Yunnan, China. Modern soil erosion rates are calculated using RUSLE, while Holocene soil erosion rates are estimated using modern rates with reconstructed precipitation and vegetation cover sequences. Through this investigation, we found the following results. First, Holocene vegetation in the lake basin was mainly affected by climate change, and the vegetation experienced the same pattern of changes as the climate. Soil erosion and lake deposition rates, along with changes to vegetation cover, were synchronous with precipitation trends during the Holocene. Second, soil erosion and lake deposition have been exacerbated by human activities, such as deforestation and land reclamation in the Xingyun Lake basin. Finally, this study provides new insights into the effects by anthropogenic impacts and climate forcing on the processes of soil erosion and lake deposition on the millennium scale.

Better understanding the response of crops to the time and intensity of water stress at different growth stages is helpful to optimize irrigation scheduling under water limited conditions. A 4-year (2013-2016) field experiment was conducted at Yangling on the Loess Plateau, to quantify the effects of timing and intensity of water stress on yield, actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and water use efficiency (WUE) of summer maize, and to identify the most sensitive stage of maize to water stress. Two deficit irrigation levels, i.e. 70 mm and 110 mm, were considered. For each irrigation level, irrigation was applied for any three of four key growth stages of maize: seedling (D1), jointing (D2), tasseling (D3) and grain filling (D4). The results showed that: (1) water stress at vegetative growth stages had higher yield response factors than that at reproductive growth stages, indicating the former tended to have greater effects on maize yield; (2) although maize yield increased linearly with ETa, the variations of yield and WUE with changed ETa were not synchronous. Low-level irrigation should be applied in the regions with severe water shortage to obtain the maximum WUE, while in regions with more water a crop can be irrigated based on sufficient irrigation scheduling; (3) the contour map of Yield-ETa-WUE indicated a greater effect of yield on WUE than that of ETa on WUE. When irrigation water is limited, high WUE can be achieved if it is applied at vegetative growth stages, while high yield can be achieved if more available water is applied at tasseling stage. Therefore, in order to develop a sustainable irrigation scheduling on the Loess Plateau, water availability and agriculture production goals (high WUE or high yield) should be taken into account together.

However, information about the response of soil respiration to saline water irrigation is limited. To identify the effect of saline water irrigation on soil respiration, the experiment based on long-term saline water irrigation cotton fields (since 2006) was conducted in the Heilonggang area in 2021. Five salinity levels in irrigation water were tested (3.4 [S1], 7.1 [S2], 10.6 [S3], 14.1 [S4], and 17.7 dS m(-1) [S5]), and deep ground water (1.3 dS m(-1)) was used as the control (CK). After 15 years of saline water irrigation, we monitored soil physicochemical properties and soil respiration. In addition, we developed a structural equation model of the relationship between them. The results demonstrated that saline water irrigation significantly reduced soil water-stable aggregate content and porosity by 4.42-45.33% and 6.52-14.10%, respectively, and attenuated soil cellulase, a-glucosidase, and alkaline phosphatase activity. Soil respiration under saline water irrigation was significantly reduced by 5.28-33.08%. Moreover, saline water irrigation with salinity below 10.6 dS m(-1) had no significant effect on cotton yield. Moreover, soil salinity (62%), water-stable aggregate content (46%), and soil porosity (25%) had significant effects on soil respiration, and soil porosity had a significant positive effect on soil alkaline phosphatase activity according to the structural equation model. Overall, saline irrigation with salinity below 10.6 dS m(-1) can alleviate water shortages and reduce soil carbon emissions without affecting cotton yield in the study area.						gao, yang/0000-0003-3209-4788; Zhou, Shuang/0009-0002-2744-3330														2073-4395				APR 24	2023	13	5							1197	10.3390/agronomy13051197	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13051197													WOS:000995485500001

Rill detachment rates on saturated soil slopes were numerically calculated from the dataset of the rill erosion process. The datasets of sediment concentrations were obtained from laboratory experiments, along saturated soil rills 1, 2, 4 and 8 m under slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees and 20 degrees and flow rates of 2, 4 and 8 L min(-1), and were used to compute rill detachment rates through a numerical algorithm. The resulting rill detachment rates on saturated soil slopes ranged from 0.006 to 0.994 kg m(-2) s(-1). Exponential functions fitted well the rill detachment rates with rill lengths, whereas linear functions fitted well those with sediment concentrations. The rill detachment rate patterns of saturated soil slopes exhibited similar rill erosion-sediment concepts to those of non-saturated soil slopes. However, saturated soil slopes were detached considerably faster than the non-saturated soil slopes. Detachment rates of saturated soil rills were initially and considerably more rapid and decreased faster with rill length than those of non-saturated soil rills. The saturated soil rills detached 1.627 to 2.246 times the sediments of the non-saturated soil rills. This phenomenon indicates that faster rill detachments in saturated soil rills make sediment loads in water approach the sediment transport capacities faster than those in non-saturated soil rills. The computed detachment rates and the functional relationships in this work can provide a basis for determining rill erosion model parameters on saturated soil slopes. Highlights Detachment rate of saturated rill can be computed similarly to non-saturated rill. Rill detachment rate is well correlated to sediment concentration and rill length. Soil particles in saturated rill are detached considerably faster than non-saturated rill.

However, it suffers from poor rangeland management and a lack of research and information. The objectives of this study were to develop a method for forecasting forage biomass and to quantify production of and spatial variation in forage from satellite imagery. We downloaded Sentinel-2 images and processed spectral information in the blue, red, and near-infrared bands, and calculated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Combining ground sampling (on 55 plots) with remote sensing data, we developed a forage forecasting model for the area. Forage (biomass) was significantly correlated with both EVI (R-2 = 0.87; P < 0.001) and NDVI (R-2 = 0.81; P < 0.001). Both gave good predictions of forage biomass in the district. We estimated the annual biomass in each grassland pixel at the peak of the growing season. Models based on each index revealed close estimates: NDVI indicated an average of 0.76 t/ ha and a total of 38 772 t/year; EVI indicated an average of 0.78 t/ha and a total of 39 792 t/year. The estimated rangeland biomass showed high spatial variability of 0.22-4.89 t/ha.year. For future rangeland management in the area, the proposed approach and models can be used to estimate available forage biomass from satellite imagery in the middle of the grass growing season (2 months after the rains start), before the grass matures and is harvested.

J	Xiao, HB; Shi, ZH; Li, ZW; Wang, L; Chen, J; Wang, J				Xiao, Haibing; Shi, Zhihua; Li, Zhongwu; Wang, Ling; Chen, Jia; Wang, Jian			Responses of soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity to nitrogen addition: A meta-analysis in China	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Annual atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in China increased approximately 8 kg N ha(-1) from the 1980s to the 2000s, which may have greatly affected soil respiration (R-s) and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)). Although numerous individual studies have been conducted, the responses of R-s to simulated N deposition remain controversial. To reconcile the conflicting results of R-s and expand our knowledge about the response of Q(10) to N addition, a dataset with 333 independent observations in China was compiled, and a meta-analysis was performed. Our results showed that N addition increased R-s by 7.1% (P < 0.05) across all biomes. The positive response degree of R-s in croplands (27.0%, P < 0.05) was significantly greater than those in the grassland and forest biomes, which indicated that R-s in anthropogenic ecosystems might be more sensitive to N enrichment. In contrast to low and medium N levels (<= 20 g m(-2) yr(-1)), high N addition levels (> 20 g m(-2) yr(-1)) inhibited R-s due to a decrease in plant fine root biomass (RB). Compared with ammonium nitrate, urea is more likely to stimulate the release of soil C. Regression models showed that the R-s response ratio (RR) was positively correlated with pH and the RRs of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and RB. Increases in both plant roots and microbial biomass induced by N addition directly promoted R-s, and N enrichment likely increases R-s in soil with a high pH. The temperature sensitivity parameter, Q(10), decreased by 3.7% (P < 0.05) across all biomes and showed an overall negative response for different biomes (except wetlands and deserts), N addition levels and N types. The Q(10) response ratio was positively correlated with the RR of pH. Soil acidification induced by proton release during N fertilizer transformation might accelerate the decomposition of recalcitrant organic matter and further decrease the Q(10) value. Our study provides valuable information to Chinese environmental policy- and decision-makers in their attempts to evaluate the effects of N deposition on terrestrial ecosystem C cycle.

The Guassa community has a long tradition of conserving the locally known GUASSA (Festuca macrophylla) grass, which is important for the livelihoods of the community in the area for roof thatching, household uses and income generation. The objective of this study was to determine the rate of land use and land cover change (LULCC) and to identify the causes of this change in the GCCA. Satellite data were obtained from LANDSAT satellite images taken in 1986, 2003 and 2015. These images were classified with a maximum likelihood algorithm under a supervised classification method in ERDAS IMAGINE software and LULCC was analyzed using spatial analysis tools of ArcGIS 10.4 software. The local community was surveyed to determine the perception of the local community about LULCC in GCCA. The analysis determined five land cover categories: forest, bare land, farm land, shrubland and grassland. The forest land cover type constituted about 2.12% of the total area of GCCA in 1986 and increased by 1.82% from 1986 to 2003. Bare land increased over the years. Farm land at the border of GCCA decreased from 517.4 ha in 1986 to 495.09 ha in 2003 but increased to 540.8 ha in 2015. Findings from local community survey implied change of government, population growth, agricultural expansion, fire wood collection and settlement and increasing infrastructures as the major causes for the land use change of area. For sustainability of the area, it is important to strengthen and promote the traditional community conservation system which has kept the area for over 400 years.

The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is introduced to study the calibration performance of runoff and sediment parameters under nine targeted scenarios, which considers the best choice to obtain highcost performance results for decision makers through multi-objective optimization and the calculation of Pareto-optimal front with a high precision. (i) SWAT model has good adaptability in the runoff simulation of the Yanhe River watershed. Both the calibration results of NSGA-II and sequential uncertainty fitting approach-version 2 (SUFI-2) can meet the accuracy requirements of runoff simulation. Particularly, the NSGA-II based on multiple objective functions not only has strong applicability but also can better constrain the parameter process, making the calibrated model more in line with the physical conditions of the watershed. (ii) The two-site synchronous calibration of runoff or sediment can make full use of data information of different sites, reduce the impact of spatial heterogeneity on model parameters, and improve the calibration efficiency of the model. The single-site synchronous calibration of runoff and sediment based on NSGA-II not only has high calibration efficiency but also can avoid the tedious steps of calibrating runoff and sediment separately. (iii) The two-site synchronous calibration of runoff and sediment based on NSGA-II combines the advantages of the above synchronous calibration strategies, which can get Pareto-optimal front and represent the best trade-offs among different objectives, and its applicability is stronger than the traditional single-site or single-element calibration strategy. This study provides new and competing ways to evaluate hydrological models and their performance, and the multiple criteria approach for watershed modeling is one of the focuses in future research extensions.					wu, lei/D-3286-2017	wu, lei/0000-0002-5602-674X													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2023	30	24					65470	65481		10.1007/s11356-023-27075-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-27075-1		APR 2023						37085679					WOS:001053419200009

However, the mechanism by which nitrogen (N) deposition changes the microbial community of root litter with different diameters remains unclear. Materials and methods We used high-throughput sequencing to compare the microbial community of root litter of Pinus tabulaeformis treated with N application (0-9 g N m(-2) y(-1)) and with three diameter classes as follows: D1, < 0.5 mm; D2, 0.5 - 1.0 mm; D3, 1.0 - 2.0 mm. Results and discussion (1) The Chao and Shannon indexes of the fungal community significantly increased in D1 and decreased in roots of other sizes after N application (P < 0.05). No significant difference was found in bacterial characteristics among N treatments and root diameters. (2) The relative abundance of Ascomycota increased then decreased with N applications, whereas that of Basidiomycota showed the opposite trend. (3) On the genus level, the relative abundance of three fungal taxonomic populations and six bacterial taxonomic populations had parabolic response to N application and reached the maximum values at 3 or 6 g N m(-2) y(-1). The relative abundances of Penicillium and Candidatus increased, while Paraphoma and Rhodoplanes decreased with root diameters. (4) Carbon, lignin, and cellulose contents had driving effect on Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Geomyces abundances, while having little correlation with fungal populations. Functional populations Verrucomicrobia, Geomyces, and Proteobacteria had negative driving effects on enzyme activities of galactosidase, cellobiase, and alkaline phosphatase. These results occurred due to the nutrient quality of substances and bring the changes in enzymatic hydrolysis processes of root litter. Conclusions N application had varied effects on richness of the fungal community of root litter with different diameters, and bacterial community has a stable structure and plays an important role in macromolecular decomposition.

How to explain the similarity of the migration patterns of crop yield and population density for different countries/regions is still uncertain and worth studying. Here, we estimated the similarity between migrations of main crop caloric yield (i.e. maize, rice, wheat, and soybean) and population density using Frechet distance, and investigated the regression relationship between Frechet distance and related climatic and socioeconomic variables for countries/regions with different economic development stages. The results indicated that different countries/regions showed different Frechet distances during 2000-2015, with a maximum value of 24.44 for Russia and a minimum value of 0.11 for Georgia. For countries/regions with different economic development stages, the built regression models can explain 39%-93% of the variability in the Frechet distance. Log(land area), log(GDP), and log(land area under cereal production) were always included in regression models and had higher importance in explaining the variability of Frechet distance. For the model for all countries/regions, both the log(land area) and log(GDP per capita) may positively link to the Frechet distance. Possible reasons for these results are that countries/regions with high GDP (or GDP per capita) may ease the conflict of land resources between humans and crops to achieve agricultural industrialization, which causes the far connection of the migrations for crop caloric yield and population density. The complicated interactions of crop production, population dynamic, and socioeconomic development should be given greater attention in the future.

This study comparatively illustrates the utility of high-resolution data and geospatial technique, particularly the GIS-based RUSLE model, for an improved understanding of the spatial patterns of soil erosion under different land use types, geomorphological styles, vegetational regionalizations, and geographical zonings, aiming to promote ecological sustainable watershed management in practice. Results indicate the following: (i) The soil erosion intensity grade showed an overall decreasing trend from northwest to southeast in the Jinghe River Watershed. The percentages of intense erosion and extremely intense erosion in different land use types in 2015 were significantly lower than that in 2000 except middle- and low-coverage grasslands because of the effective implementation of "Grain for Green" project. e.g., the percentage of extremely intense erosion in dry land decreased from 41.72% in 2000 to 8.99% in 2015. (ii) The mid-elevation loessial beams and hills and mid-elevation loessial tableland were both the major sources of intense erosion and extremely intense erosion, with the contribution ratio of 41.89 and 53.94% and 35.79 and 20.83% in 2000 and 44.45 and 48.99% and 36.88 and 18.72% in 2015, respectively. (iii) The intense, extremely intense and severe erosion in the temperate typical grassland subzone accounted for 32.62, 44.47, and 9.6% in 2000 and 36.74, 40.7, and 8.1% in 2015, respectively. There were no severe and extremely intense erosion in the deciduous oak forest subzone of northern and southern warm temperate. (iv) The intense, extremely intense, and severe erosion of the loessial wide valley hills accounted for 32.19, 45.27, and 8.92% in 2000 and 36.32, 41.42, and 7.48% in 2015. The intense and extremely intense erosion of the loessial tableland accounted for 40.58 and 16.02% in 2000 and 40.57 and 14.27% in 2015. More importantly, land use types can be applied to the design and implementation of a development scheme more reliably than other landscapes because the land use system is a more scientific and fine classification based on topography, soils, and vegetation correlated with geology, geomorphology, and climate.

However, the current understanding of mechanisms that shape microbial diversity along environmental gradients at broad spatial scales is relatively limited, especially for specific functional groups, such as potential diazotrophs. Here, we conducted an aridity-gradient transect survey from 60 sites across the Tibetan Plateau, the largest alpine ecosystem of the planet, to investigate the ecological processes (e.g., local species pools, community assembly processes, and co-occurrence patterns) that underlie the beta-diversity of alpine soil potential diazotrophic communities. We found that aridity strongly and negatively affected the abundance, richness, and beta-diversity of soil diazotrophs. Diazotrophs displayed a distance-decay pattern along the aridity gradient, with organisms living in lower aridity habitats having a stronger distance-decay pattern. Arid habitats had lower co-occurrence complexity, including the number of edges and vertices, the average degree, and the number of keystone taxa, as compared with humid habitats. Local species pools explained limited variations in potential diazotrophic beta-diversity. In contrast, co-occurrence patterns and stochastic processes (e.g., dispersal limitation and ecological drift) played a significant role in regulating potential diazotrophic beta-diversity. The relative importance of stochastic processes and co-occurrence patterns changed with increasing aridity, with stochastic processes weakening whereas that of co-occurrence patterns enhancing. The genera Geobacter and Paenibacillus were identified as keystone taxa of co-occurrence patterns that are associated with beta-diversity. In summary, aridity affects the co-occurrence patterns and community assembly by regulating soil and vegetation characteristics and ultimately shapes the beta-diversity of potential diazotrophs. These findings highlight the importance of co-occurrence patterns in structuring microbial diversity and advance the current understanding of mechanisms that drive belowground communities.IMPORTANCERecent studies have shown that community assembly processes and species pools are the main drivers of beta-diversity in grassland microbial communities. However, co-occurrence patterns can also drive beta-diversity formation by influencing the dispersal and migration of species, the importance of which has not been reported in previous studies. Assessing the impact of co-occurrence patterns on beta-diversity is important for understanding the mechanisms of diversity formation. Our study highlights the influence of microbial co-occurrence patterns on beta-diversity and combines the drivers of community beta-diversity with drought variation, revealing that drought indirectly affects beta-diversity by influencing diazotrophic co-occurrence patterns and community assembly.

As global warming progresses, reduced chilling may gain increasing importance in regulating flowering dates, and eventually offset flowering advances in response to warmer springs. Later onset of flowering events may arise, with negative effects on plant fitness. However, delayed flowering in trees may also reduce the risk from late frosts. Different temperature conditions at both margins of the apple growing areas of Shaanxi in China provide a natural laboratory to examine the responses of trees' flowering phenology and late frost risk to climate warming. We identified the chilling and heat accumulation periods for apples by Partial Least Squares regression of first flowering dates against daily chilling and heat accumulation rates during 2001-2016. We then analyzed the impacts of temperatures during these periods on flowering timing, and evaluated the frost risk for each site. Results indicated increasing importance of chilling temperatures from north to south, with greatest effects determined for the warmest site, where delayed blossom has been observed during the past 16 years. Since late frosts mostly occurred before tree flowering, only minor frost damage was detected for our study areas, with future delays in flowering likely to reduce the frost risk even further. The redistribution of apple trees to nearby locations with cold winters, either northward or uphill, could be a promising strategy to reduce the risk of insufficient chilling and ensure that production remains viable in a warming future.

J	Cheng, Z; Zhao, JX; Sun, J; Wu, GL				Cheng, Zhen; Zhao, Jingxue; Sun, Jian; Wu, Gao-Lin			Determining the role of richness and evenness in alpine grassland productivity across climatic and edaphic gradients	OECOLOGIA												Spatial heterogeneity of climatic and edaphic gradients can substantially affect the grassland productivity function. However, few studies have tested the importance of species richness and evenness on regulating grassland productivity across spatial-scale climatic and edaphic changes. This study examines the complex mechanisms by which species richness and evenness regulate productivity in alpine meadow and steppe. We used field survey data to explore above-ground productivity formation and sensitivity to spatial-scale climatic and edaphic response of alpine grassland based on species richness and evenness. Results showed that the growing season solar radiation was the main driving factor of above-ground biomass and was strongly negatively correlated with above-ground biomass. Furthermore, compared with alpine steppe, above-ground biomass in alpine meadow was more responsive to climatic variables, but less responsive to soil variables. Unexpectedly, we found that the regulation patterns of species richness and evenness on above-ground biomass were different in both habitats by a structural equation model analysis. Our study demonstrated that species evenness and richness were both important in co-regulating above-ground biomass in alpine meadow, whereas species richness mattered more than species evenness in regulating above-ground biomass in alpine steppe. Our results offer further support for species richness and evenness co-regulating grassland productivity across spatial-scale climatic and edaphic gradients, which helps maintain the benefits of plant diversity and alpine grassland ecosystems.

Characterizing detachment and transport processes of interrill soil erosion	GEODERMA												Detachment and transport processes of interrill soil erosion are not yet fully understood and quantified due to their complexity. Understanding these processes and their interaction is essential to developing effective interrill erosion prediction models. Thus, the objectives are to (1) identify detachment-limiting and transport-limiting regimes by comparing measured total soil splash with total sediment load of flow wash, (2) estimate relative importance of raindrop-driven and flow-driven transports under selected flow conditions using a novel experimental protocol, and (3) WA widely used erosion equations for use in both detachment-limiting and transport-limiting regimes under the experimental conditions never before used. Sediment discharge and raindrop splash were separately collected from two plots with a 2.5-cm gap between them. Three rainfall intensities of 60, 90, and 120 mm h(-1) were applied to three slopes of 9, 18, and 27% under two cover treatments of screen and tarp. Screen cover is to simulate crop canopy for dissipating raindrop energy, which is to control upslope sediment inflow by reducing raindrop detachment without modifying runoff rates. Tarp cover is to control both water and sediment inflows by varying slope length. Results showed that total raindrop splash in the entire plot during an event was less than total flow wash in the screen treatment, indicating detachment-limiting scenarios. However, total raindrop splash was greater (less) than total wash at the 9% (27%) slope in the tarp treatment, indicating transport-limiting (detachment-limiting) cases. The results indicated that raindrop-impacted flow might be able to detach soil in some cases. This finding runs counter to the common wisdom that soil detachment in interrill erosion is solely caused by raindrop impact. If raindrop-impacted flow can detach soil, the determination of limiting process by direct comparison between splash and wash loads seemed overly simplistic. Raindrop-driven transport was estimated for the first time by a means of dissipating raindrop impact energy in this study. Raindrop-driven transport was found to increase with rainfall intensity and slope gradients. Stream power and an empirical multiplication-of-factor equation performed well in predicting interrill sediment delivery under all erosion regimes, suggesting that it is unnecessary to develop distinct predictive equations for different interrill erosion regimes.

Since all existing equations for contain the Reynolds number (R-e), it is problematic if the velocity is unknown. In this study, the performance of existing equations collected from studies on vertical pipes is assessed, and an approximation for the of vertical pipes in the full flow regime, without R-e, is proposed. The performance of the Brki and Praks equation is the best, with a maximum relative error (MRE) of 0.003% (extremely accurate). The MRE of the new approximation is 0.43%, and its assessment level is very accurate.

However, it is still controversial whether mixed-species plantations (MP) were more conducive to the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks than monoculture plantations (PP). Methods We conducted a meta-analysis based on 21 publications to assess the effects of different afforestation modes as well as controlling factors of SOC stocks on the Loess Plateau of China. Results Compared with monoculture plantations, mixed-species plantations could significantly increase the response size of SOC stocks by 28%. For different species combinations, tree-shrub mixtures were more conducive to increasing the SOC stocks. In climate-limited regions (MAT <8 degrees C, MAP <500 mm), the response size of SOC stocks of mixed-species plantations was 34% higher than that of monoculture plantations. Furthermore, significant differences were found in the response size of SOC stocks at young (< 10 yr) and mature stages (> 20 yr). Compared with abandoned land, afforestation on cropland, especially mixed-species plantations, could increase the SOC stocks by 10%. Additionally, compared with monoculture plantations, a stronger coupling relationship was observed between the soil total nitrogen (STN) and SOC stocks in mixed-species plantations. Conclusion Our results suggest that for the Loess Plateau of China, planting mixed-species plantations containing nitrogen-fixing plants is a more effective approach to enhancing the SOC stocks than monoculture plantations.

J	Yang, XL; Shao, MA; Wei, XR				Yang, Xianlong; Shao, Ming'an; Wei, Xiaorong			Stemflow production differ significantly among tree and shrub species on the Chinese Loess Plateau	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Information for the interspecific variation in plant stemflow production may provide important implications for their survival in drought conditions. Our objectives were to determine if stemflow generation varied with plant species and to ascertain their possible responses to rainfall characteristics and plant morphology. Stemflow volume (SFv), stemflow depth (SFD), stemflow percentages of gross rainfall (SFD/GR), and funnelling ratio (FR, a quantitative index to evaluate water enrichment by stemflow) were quantified in 2014 and 2015 for coexisting two tree species (Pines tabulifomis and Armeniaca vulgaris) and two shrub species (Salix psammophila and Caragana korshinskii) on the Loess Plateau of China. The results indicated that the generation of stemflow varied significantly among the studied four species. The shrub species had larger values of SFv, SFD , and SFD/GR than tree species. FR values revealed that the soil at the plant bases for P. tabuliformis, A. vulgaris, S. psarrunophila, and C. korshinskii, could receive averages of 13.1-, 23.9-, 78.2-, and 124.9-fold more rainwater, respectively, than an equivalent open area. Characteristics of rainfall had a notable influence on stemflow production. Specifically, SFN, and SFD were all positively and linearly correlated with rainfall in 2014 and 2015. SFD/GR and FR increased linearly with rainfall in 2014, whereas increased exponentially or even decreased after reaching a rainfall threshold in 2015. Significant influence of plant morphology on stemflow production was only observed for P. tabuliformis but not for the other species. In conclusion, the studied two shrub species (S. psammophila and C. korshinskii) were morphologically more effective than the tree species (P. tabuliformis and A. vulgaris) in funnelling rainwater to the soil of the basal area. This could be eco-hydrologically significant for their survival in drought environments.

Obtaining soil maps of surface SOC is fundamental to evaluating soil quality, regulating climate change, and global carbon cycle modeling. However, efficient approaches for obtaining accurate SOC information remain challenging, especially in remote or inaccessible regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which is influenced by complex terrains, climate change, and human activities. This study employed field measurements, SoilGrids250m (SOC_250m, a spatial resolution of 250 m x 250 m), and Sentinel-2 images with different machine learning methods to map SOC content in the QTP. Four machine learning methods including partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to construct spatial prediction models based on 396 field-collected sampling points and various covariates from remote sensing images. Our results revealed that the RF model outperformed the PLSR, SVM, and ANN models, with a higher determination coefficient (R-2 of 0.82 is from the training datasets) and the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD = 2.54). The selected covariates according to the variable importance in projection (VIP) were: SOC_250m, B2, B11, Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), B5, and Soil-Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI). The predicted SOC map showed an overall decrease in SOC content ranging from 69.30 g center dot kg(-1) in the southeast to 1.47 g center dot kg(-1) in the northwest. Our prediction showed spatial heterogeneity of SOC content, indicating that Sentinel-2 images were acceptable for characterizing the variability of SOC. The findings provide a scientific basis for carbon neutrality in the QTP and a reference for the digital mapping of SOC in the alpine region.

However, the impacts of GE on soil properties and greenhouse gas emissions of alpine shrub meadow are still unclear, especially long-term GE of more than ten years. To fill part of this gap, we examined the effects of long-term GE of alpine shrub meadow on soil nutrients, soil properties, greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 and CH4) and soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover. When compared to grazed grassland (GG), long-term GE resulted in: 1) greater SOC, nitrogen (N), and phosphorous (P) content, especially in the 20-30 cm soil layer; 2) greater soil C:N, C:P and N:P ratios in the 20-30 cm depth; 3) greater soil CO2, but lesser CH4 emission during the growing season; and 4) much faster SOC turn-over time (0-30 cm). GE of more than ten years can increase grassland C reserves and improve the C sequestration ca-pacity of the ecosystem. Results from this study can have important implications in developing future grassland management policies on soil nutrient balances, restoration of degraded grassland and controlling shrub expansion.

Methods We investigated changes in soil fungal community composition, diversity, structure and functional groups in the topsoil (0-20 cm) following afforestation. Six forest types were analyzed in this study:Robinia pseudoacacia(RP),Platycladus orientalis(PO),Pinus tabuliformis(PT),Robinia pseudoacacia + Platycladus orientalis(RPPO),Robinia pseudoacacia + Pinus tabuliformis(RPPT), andPlatycladus orientalis + Pinus tabuliformis(POPT). Results Soil fungal community composition and diversity significantly varied among cropland and forestland samples. Afforestation generally reduced soil fungal diversity and altered functional groups, and these variations were mainly mediated by tree species. Rare genera play an important role in the soil fungal network among cropland and forestland samples. Soil available phosphorus (AP) explained the largest portion of the variance in the soil fungal community. Soil available nutrients and microclimate were significantly associated with soil fungal diversity and richness. Conclusions Our observations indicate that afforestation of cropland fundamentally restructures soil fungal community composition, structure, diversity and functional groups. Nutrient availability was a principal factor regulating fungal community composition following afforestation.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				DEC	2020	457	1-2			SI		279	292		10.1007/s11104-020-04739-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-020-04739-2		OCT 2020											WOS:000577247800001

However, most studies concentrate on a few species and their vein variation across horizontal spatial scale, we know little about how vein traits shift along the vertical scale, e.g., elevational gradient along a mountain, and how such patterns are shaped by plant types and environmental factors. Here, we aimed to investigate the variation in leaf vein traits (i.e., vein density, VD; vein thickness, VT; and vein volume per unit leaf area, VV) of 93 woody species distributed along an elevational gradient (1,374-3,375 m) in a temperate mountain in China. Our results showed that altitude-related trends differed between growth forms. Tree plants from higher altitudes had lower VD but higher VT and VV than those from lower altitude; however, the opposite tend was observed in VD of shrubs, and no significant altitudinal changes in their VT or VV. Plant phylogenetic information at the clade level rather than climate explained most of variation in three leaf vein traits (17.1-86.6% vs. <0.011-6.3% explained variance), supporting the phylogenetic conservatism hypothesis for leaf vein traits. Moreover, the phylogenetic effects on vein traits differed between trees and shrubs, with the vein traits of trees being relatively more conserved. Together, our study provides new picture of leaf vein variation along the altitude, and highlights the importance of taking plant phylogeny into consideration when discussing trait variation from an ecological to a biogeographic scale.

Responses of winter wheat yield and water productivity to sowing time and plastic mulching in the Loess Plateau	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												On the Loess Plateau, unfavorable late-sowing conditions often arise due to late harvests from the previous season or excessive rainfall during the sowing season, which can delay seed germination, reduce tiller numbers, and decrease winter wheat yields. Few studies have explored whether plastic mulching (PM) can mitigate the adverse effects of late sowing. Consequently, we conducted a 3-year field experiment from 2017 to 2020 on the Loess Plateau combining two mulching conditions [PM and no mulching (NPM)] and three sowing times (normal, 10-day late, and 20-day late sowing). We investigated the combined influence of sowing time and mulching conditions on soil hydrothermal status, crop water productivity (WP), and yield. The results revealed that delayed sowing significantly prolonged emergence times and decreased tiller numbers, leaf area index (LAI), root biomass, and aboveground biomass (AGB). The PM increased soil temperatures, advancing wheat emergence and increasing tiller numbers. Plants under PM had higher LAI, root biomass, and AGB than those under NPM. Moreover, PM reduced ineffective transpiration by accelerating the degradation of ineffective tillers, resulting in higher yields without a corresponding increase in evapotranspiration. The beneficial effects extended to spike numbers, thousand-grain weight, and harvest index. Specifically, PM combined with 10-day late sowing increased yield by 12.8 % compared to NPM combined with normal sowing. Furthermore, under 20-day late sowing, PM mitigated yield losses, reducing them from a 28.7 % decline under NPM to a 12.8 % decline when compared to normal sowing under NPM. We conclude that PM completed compensated for the yield loss under 10-day late sowing and partially alleviated losses under 20-day late sowing. Therefore, combining 10-day late sowing (accumulated air temperature before winter > 430 degrees C d) with PM was the optimal approach for simultaneously improving yield and WP in winter wheat seasons with unfavorable late-sowing conditions.

A comprehensive objective function of optimization involves minimizing (i) difference between weekly plant nitrogen uptake and requirement and (ii) nitrate losses (nitrate leaching and accumulated nitrate in the root zone). Coupling a simulation model to an optimization algorithm for obtaining the objective function variables (N plant uptake and nitrate losses) typically requires long runtimes as the simulation model is repeatedly applied over iterations of the optimization algorithm. One attractive way to reduce the programming and computational demands associated with optimization is to construct a simpler, faster, but sufficiently accurate emulator of the simulation model based on machine-learning model. This study assessed the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in modelling nitrate uptake by maize and estimation of nitrate losses in surface drip irrigation in three texturally different soils. To do this, the CNN was trained on output of the simulation model HYDRUS-2D. Various combinations of parameters influencing daily nitrate uptake (daily potential crop evapotranspiration, irrigation water and injected fertilizer amount) were evaluated as model inputs. Results indicated that daily nitrate uptake at any time t was predicted best with inputs of daily potential evapotranspiration at time t, irrigation and fertilizer amounts of the previous 1-7 days and the previous day's nitrate uptake amount. Estimated nitrate losses for constant weekly fertigation (CWF) were about 32% in sandy loam and 38.5% in sandy clay loam soil. Variable weekly fertigation (VWF) reduced the nitrate losses to 24.5% in sandy loam and 31.5% in sandy clay loam soil, while losses in loam soil were intermediate to these. The study demonstrates that CNN estimation of nitrate uptake and root zone losses can be widely used in optimization of fertigation management.

However, little is known about the impacts of extreme precipitation and size events on ecosystem carbon cycle when compared to the effects of average precipitation amount. The study involved an analysis of carbon fluxes and water exchange using the eddy covariance and chamber based techniques during the growing seasons of 2015-2017 in Bayan, Mongolia and 2019-2021 in Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia, respectively. The components of carbon fluxes and water exchange at each site were normalized to evaluate of relative response among carbon fluxes and water exchange. The investigation delved into the relationship between carbon fluxes and extreme precipitation over five gradients (control, dry spring, dry summer, wet spring and wet summer) in Hulunbuir meadow steppe and distinct four precipitation sizes (0.1-2, 2-5, 5-10, and 10-25 mm d-1) in Bayan meadow steppe. The wet spring and summer showed the greatest ecosystem respiration (ER) relative response values, 76.2% and 73.5%, respectively, while the dry spring (-16.7%) and dry summer (14.2%) showed the lowest values. Gross primary production (GPP) relative response improved with wet precipitation gradients, and declined with dry precipitation gradients in Hulunbuir meadow steppe. The least value in net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) was found at 10-25 mm d-1 precipitation size in Bayan meadow steppe. Similarly, the ER and GPP increased with size of precipitation events. The structural equation models (SEM) satisfactorily fitted the data (chi 2 = 43.03, d.f. = 11, p = 0.215), with interactive linkages among soil microclimate, water exchange and carbon fluxes components regulating NEE. Overall, this study highlighted the importance of extreme precipitation and event size in influencing ecosystem carbon exchange, which is decisive to further understand the carbon cycle in meadow steppes.

This study aimed to evaluate the comprehensive performance of 12 simplified models in characterising ETp against the benchmark Penman model across different climate sites in southeast Australia. This study used Taylor skill score (S), normalised root mean square error (nRMSE) and relative mean bias error (rMBE) to estimate models' capability in estimating ETp rates. Then, this study adopted Mann-Kendall test and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to test temporal trends and periodicity of ETp estimated by all models.New hydrology insights for the region: Jensen-Haise model was capable to produce fair (nRMSE <= 30%) estimates of daily ETp across all stations. Models except Mak1 were generally able to produce reasonable estimates of ETp at larger time scale. In addition, we found that the 12 alternative ETp models generally agreed with the Penman model on the primary (9.6-12.4-year) and quasi (2.6-3.9-year) periods of ETp, but they did not show matchable ability in detecting ETp temporal trends. The comprehensive investigation on models' performance will shed light on models' selection in estimation of drought and hydrological cycle.																				2214-5818				DEC	2023	50								101573	10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101573													WOS:001120936500001

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous signaling molecule, may regulate various physiological processes in plants. However, whether H2S has regulatory effect in this symbiotic system remains unknown. Herein, we investigated the possible role of H2S in the symbiosis between soybean (Glycine max) and rhizobium (Sinorhizobium fredii). Our results demonstrated that an exogenous H2S donor (sodium hydrosulfide [NaHS]) treatment promoted soybean growth, nodulation, and nitrogenase (Nase) activity. Western blotting analysis revealed that the abundance of Nase component nifH was increased by NaHS treatment in nodules. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction data showed that NaHS treatment upregulated the expressions of symbiosis-related genes nodA, nodC, and nodD of S. fredii. In addition, expression of soybean nodulation marker genes, including early nodulin 40 (GmENOD40), ERF required for nodulation (GmERN), nodulation signaling pathway 2b (GmNSP2b), and nodulation inception genes (GmNIN1a, GmNIN2a, and GmNIN2b), were upregulated. Moreover, the expressions of glutamate synthase (GmGOGAT), asparagine synthase (GmAS), nitrite reductase (GmNiR), ammonia transporter (GmSAT1), leghemoglobin (GmLb), and nifH involved in nitrogen metabolism were upregulated in NaHS-treated soybean roots and nodules. Together, our results suggested that H2S may act as a positive signaling molecule in the soybean-rhizobia symbiotic system and enhance the system's nitrogen fixation ability.					zhang, nina/GXH-0962-2022; Chen, Juan/GXF-5536-2022														0894-0282	1943-7706				AUG	2019	32	8					972	985		10.1094/MPMI-01-19-0003-R	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-01-19-0003-R								31204904					WOS:000477044200008

The effects of the "Grain-for-Green" program on the Loess Plateau in maintaining the abundance and diversity of soil fauna are poorly understood. This study assessed the spatial influence of five common artificial restoration habitats, Populus simonii, Pinus tabulaeformis, Caragana korshinskii, Medicago sativa, and Stipa bungeana, and one farmland habitat on the characteristics of soil fauna communities. Results showed that six soil fauna groups (Araneae, Acarina, Collembola, Isoptera, Coleoptera larvae, and Coleoptera adults) were shared among these habitats, accounting for 37.5% of the total number of groups. Acarina was the dominant group in each habitat. The soil fauna abundance in the P. tabulaeformis habitat was the highest among the habitats, reaching 7656 ind m(-2). S. bungeana had the highest diversity, richness, and evenness indices of soil fauna among the habitats. Furthermore, a remarkable correlation among main soil properties (water content, organic carbon, and available potassium), litter properties (vegetation coverage, vegetation density, and litter thickness), and soil fauna were observed. The differences in microenvironment among the six habitats had a strong influence on the composition of soil fauna communities. Compared with other habitats, the S. bungeana habitat is more conducive to the protection of biodiversity. Vegetation restoration increases the diversity of soil fauna by improving their living environment, and soil fauna communities can be used as assessment indicators for "vegetation restoration benefits." These findings help reveal the developmental tendencies of soil fauna during vegetation restoration in the Loess Plateau, and provide important support for evaluating environmental quality by soil fauna.

However, soil temperature regulation with mulching is not well controlled, which often leads to failure in crop establishment. A two-year field study was conducted to determine and simulate the effect of transparent plastic film mulching on soil temperatures at 5 cm depth (T-5) using the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model in the cold Hetao Irrigation District in north-western China. Four treatments were used: no mulch (CK), full mulching with plastic film at 140 cm width (PMF), and partial plastic film mulching at 60 cm width (PM60) and 30 cm width (PM30). Mulching did not result in a sinusoidal phase change in diurnal air temperature (T-a) between mulch and the soil surface (T-ms). T-ms decreased with a decrease in film width. Values of the daily averaged T-ms and T-5 were significantly correlated (R-2 > 0.70). Simulated T-5 matched the observed T-5 well, with marginal overestimation in both no-mulch and mulch conditions (NSE > 0.7). Embedding a simple empirical approach for T-ms calculation can reduce parameter input into the DNDC model, and result in acceptable T-5 simulation.						zhou, lifeng/0000-0002-8378-0772													0365-0340	1476-3567				DEC 5	2020	66	14					1936	1947		10.1080/03650340.2019.1702163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2019.1702163		DEC 2019											WOS:000502510900001

Ecological variables over multi-spatial scales and macroinvertebrate community data were collected in June (normal flow season) and September (high flow season) of 2017 in the Weihe River Basin (WRB). A total of 14,377 individuals were identified, which were classified into 7 classes, 18 orders and 59 families. Macroinvertebrate community composition, density, biomass, the values of Pielou evenness index (E), Simpson diversity index (lambda) were significantly different between normal flow season and high flow season. The dominant species (Tubificidae, Chironomidae and Baetidae) were the same in both seasons. The highest richness, abundance, density and biomass occurred at a stream bed depth of 0-10 cm. The results of canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) showed that ecological factors explained the major variation in macroinvertebrate community composition. Specifically, the increased nitrogen concentrations favored tolerant species, whereas high velocity and dissolved oxygen (DO) benefitted community taxa richness and biodiversity. The reduction of taxa richness, abundance, density and biomass in high flow season was related to the summer flood. Increased nutrient concentrations and macroinvertebrate habitat damage contributed to more tolerant, yet less diverse stream macroinvertebrate assemblages.					wang, xinxin/HIR-2598-2022; Song, Jinxi/AAF-6060-2020	Song, Jinxi/0000-0001-9838-8063; Wang, Xinxin/0000-0001-8013-3660													0925-8574	1872-6992				DEC	2019	140								105595	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.105595	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.105595													WOS:000489618600007

However, the mechanism by which warming affects the biogeochemical processes, and consequently the microbial nutrient limitation in soil aggregates, is not clear. In this study, we implemented a 21-year long-term open-top-chamber (OTCs) warming experiment to reveal the warming effects on the soil aggregate microbial nutrient limitation mechanisms in a Tibetan alpine meadow and shrubland. Long-term warming significantly decreased soil aggregate-associated organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations in alpine meadows, but promoted soil carbon pool in alpine shrublands. SOC and TN concentrations in microaggregate (MIGA: < 0.25 mm) showed the greatest in alpine meadows. Soil enzyme activities increased with the decrease in aggregate size, and enzyme stoichiometry results demonstrated that soil microbes in alpine meadows and shrubland were limited by phosphorus (P); moreover, the long-term warming significantly aggravated the soil aggregate microbial P limitation in the shrubland. Meanwhile, the long-term warming had no significant effect on microbial C limitation in the alpine meadow and shrubland, but soil aggregate size mediated the microbial C limitation patterns and showed the greatest C limitation in MIGA. Phosphorus limitation is likely to be an important constraint to the development of alpine ecosystems in future climate warming, and the protection of MIGA is one of the important mechanisms for carbon pool sequestration.

WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Climate and underlying-surface changes give rise to governance challenges in water resource management in arid and semi-arid regions, and knowledge of the spatiotemporal patterns of water yield is critical in policy and stakeholder engagement. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was integrated using spatial autocorrelation analysis, empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), rotated EOF (REOF), and wavelet analysis to explore variations in water yield and factors influencing the Jinghe River watershed from 1980 to 2010. The well-calibrated SWAT-based methodological framework, which considers the influence of climatic and human activities using dynamic modeling and statistical decomposition, is a reliable tool for evaluating and visualizing the spatiotemporal patterns of water yield at the watershed scale. The water yield of the Jinghe River watershed showed an overall downward trend over time and from southeast to northwest. The variation in water yield from the 1980s to the 1990s was mostly attributed to climate, though human activities became the dominant factor from the 1990s to the twenty-first century. Three spatial modes of water yield were detected by EOF: "consistent in the whole watershed," "North-South," and "central in middle and North." The variance contributions were 77.68%, 12.92%, and 6.67%, respectively. Four regional modes of water yield were obtained through the REOF: north-south, central, eastern, and western. The variance contributions were 36.2%, 32.35%, 23.42%, and 7.58%, respectively. These findings will help deepen the understanding of the patterns of water yield and its response to climate and underlying surface in arid and semi-arid regions, which has practical significance for hydrologists, environmentalists, water resources scientists, and policymakers in assessing available water resources for a proposed or existing development.

Ridge planting with transparent plastic mulching improves maize productivity by regulating the distribution and utilization of soil water, heat, and canopy radiation in arid irrigation area	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Ridge-furrow mulching system is widely used for improving soil hydrothermal conditions and crop productivity in semiarid and arid rainfed areas. The response of crop productivity to resource capture and utilization is crucial for agricultural field management and sustainable development. However, few have simultaneously investigated the coupling effect of plastic film mulching (PM) types and planting patterns on root and shoot growth, photosynthesis, yield, resource capture and utilization as well as their potential links in the same experiment, especially in arid irrigation areas, limiting our understanding of PM and ridge planting application. This study conducted a two-year field experiment with four treatments: 1) fiat planting with transparent plastic film mulch (FT); 2) fiat planting with black plastic film mulch (FB); 3) ridge-furrow planting with transparent plastic film mulch (RT); 4) ridge-furrow planting with black plastic film mulch (RB). The results showed that RT significantly increased soil water storage and root growth at the silking and grain-filling stages in both years by enhancing soil thermal time with 151.9-176.2 degrees C d and the intercepted photosynthetic active radiation with 22.2-57.4 MJ m-2. In addition, RT had a significantly higher net photosynthetic rate than FT and FB at the 12-leaf and silking stages, enhancing the transportation of stem and leaf to grain. The logistic equation using growing degree days as the independent variable characterized the dynamic features of maize growth under different PM types (transparent or black) coupled with ridge-furrow planting. RT accelerated dry matter accumulation by enhancing the maximum growth rate and extending the rapid growth period, resulting in 12.9-15.2 % more dry matter accumulation and 10.0-16.7 % higher grain yields than FB. Furthermore, RT significantly increased resource use efficiencies by 10.1-17.3 % for water, 3.0-5.5 % for thermal, and 4.0-9.1 % for radiation compared with FB. Ridge planting had the highest contributor rates, with >40 % for yield and resource capture. This study suggests that RT maintains high maize productivity and resource use efficiencies in arid irrigation areas with limited water resources by regulating soil water, heat, and canopy radiation distribution and utilization.

However, the temporal variations and main driving factors of CH4 fluxes in alpine wetlands are not yet well understood. In this study, CH4 fluxes were measured from an alpine wetland in the Qinghai Lake using eddy covariance (EC) technique. Strong seasonal variability in the daily CH4 fluxes was observed, ranging from - 18.24 mg CH4 m(- 2) d(- 1) during the non-growing season to 117.44 mg CH4 m(- 2) d(- 1) during the growing season in 2017. The annual CH4 budget was 9.41 g CH4 m(- 2). The growing season CH4 flux accounted for 91.5 % of the annual budget. At the daily scale, the CH4 fluxes increased significantly as the net radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, soil temperature, and soil volumetric water content at 5 cm depth increased. Additionally, correlation analysis also revealed that daily CH4 flux was significantly related to CO2 flux when daily CO2 flux was negative, but there was no correlation when daily CO2 flux was positive. Path analysis showed that seasonal variations of soil temperature at 5 cm depth and CO2 flux had strong direct effects on daily CH4 fluxes.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2021	41	5							53	10.1007/s13157-021-01415-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-021-01415-8													WOS:000644843000001

However, little is known about changes in these taxa and their interactions during the natural recovery of abandoned land. Here, we investigated the changes in and interactions between AMF and nifH gene-expressing bacteria in farmland (S1), grassland (S2), shrubland (S3), pioneer forests (S4), and climax forests (S5) as five typical stages of vegetation succession on the Loess Plateau, China. We found that vegetation succession significantly influenced the diversity of AMF and nifH communities. With the progression of secondary succession, the diversity of AMF increased from farmland to pioneer forest communities, and decreased in the climax vegetation, while the diversity of the nifH community first decreased and then gradually increased. The community structures of the AMF and nifH com-munities differed significantly between the five vegetation types. Specifically, the AMF community structure changed significantly during the later stages of succession, while the N-fixing bacteria community tended to be stable during late succession. The interactions between AMF and nifH bacteria gradually increased from the farmland to shrub stages but tended to weaken from the shrub to climax forest stages. Therefore, the relation-ships between microbial communities during the early and middle stages of vegetation succession following land abandonment on the Loess Plateau are mainly cooperative and mutually beneficial, while competition likely intensifies during later successional stages. Furthermore, we found that soil microbial biomass, enzyme activity, and total phosphorus content were the main drivers of microbial community changes.

Studies have shown that stored nitrogen in the vadose zone can eventually reach the water table and affect the quality of groundwater resources. Recently, global scale models have been implemented to quantify nitrate storage and nitrate travel time in the vadose zone. These global models are simplistic and relatively easy to implement and therefore facilitate analysis of the considered transport processes at a regional scale with no further requirements. However, the suitability of applying these models at a regional scale has not been tested. Here, we evaluate, for the first time, the performance and utility of global scale models at the regional scale. Applied to the Loess Plateau of China, we compare estimates of groundwater recharge and nitrate storage derived from global scale models with results from a regional scale approach utilizing the Richards and advection-dispersion equations. The estimated nitrate storage was compared to nitrate observations collected in the deep vadose zone (>50 m) at five sites across the Loess Plateau. Although both models predict similar spatial patterns of nitrate storage, the recharge fluxes were three times smaller and the nitrate storage was two times higher compared with the regional model. The results suggest that global scale models are a potentially useful screening tool, but require refinement for local scale applications.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the carcass parameters and meat quality of Tibetan sheep and Small-tailed Han sheep when consuming a diet of low-protein (7%) and different energy yields (digestible energy, 8.21, 9.33, 10.45 and 11.57 MJ/kg) in the cold season. Twelve sheep of each breed were divided randomly into four treatments of different diets with three replicates per treatment per breed. Crude protein of the meat decreased linearly (p < .05), whereas energy increased linearly (p < .05) with an increase in energy level. Tibetan sheep tended to have a higher (p < .1) dressing percentage and rib eye area, while live body weight and hot carcass weight did not differ between breeds but increased linearly (p < .01) with an increase in energy level. Water holding capacity, as indicated by pressing loss and drip loss, did not differ between breeds and was not affected by dietary energy. The concentration of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was greater in Tibetan sheep meat but saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and n-6 PUFA did not differ between breeds. With an increase in energy content of the diet, SFA decreased (p < .05), whereas MUFA increased (p < .05). The n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio was lower (p < .001) in Tibetan sheep meat, while the atherogenic index did not differ between breeds, but tended to decrease (p < .1) with an increase in dietary energy content. The essential amino acid (EAA) content and ratio of EAA:NEAA (non-essential amino acid) were close to the world standards for healthy meat. In summary, (a) Tibetan sheep meat was preferable to Small-tailed Han sheep meat, although differences between breeds were small; and (b) some carcass parameters and meat quality were improved with an increase in dietary energy level when a low-protein diet was offered.

This study focused on the Yanhe River Watershed to investigate the time-varying characteristics of sensitivity and identifiability of SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) runoff and sediment parameters based on the Sobol' and generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation methods. The results indicate that (i) the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II has good adaptability and reliability in parameter calibration of the SWAT model in the Yanhe River Watershed. The evaluation indicators (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, R-2, and percent bias) of monthly runoff and sediment in the Ganguyi hydrological station were all satisfactory per the SWAT model during the calibration and validation periods. (ii) The interaction between runoff and sediment parameters is a crucial reason for parameter sensitivity, which has obvious time-varying characteristics and is largely dependent on precipitation in the Yanhe River Watershed. Temporal and spatial variability of precipitation should be considered in the detailed analysis of parameter identifiability, and watershed managers should not ignore changes in the runoff process when regulating sediment. (iii) Only a relatively small number of parameters can be identified in the runoff and sediment simulation process of the Yanhe River Watershed, such as CN2 (initial soil conservation service runoff curve number for moisture condition II), CH_K2 (effective hydraulic conductivity in main channel alluvium), ALPHA_BF (baseflow alpha factor), USLE_C (cover and management factor), USLE_P (support practice factor), and USLE_K (soil erodibility factor), due to high surface runoff, reduced lag time, reduced low flows, increased peak flows, and channel erosion, respectively. More importantly, there is a strong positive correlation between parameter identifiability and parameter sensitivity. Both are effective methods of parameter diagnosis, but the identifiability of parameters is not equivalent to its sensitivity. Our results strongly suggest that a detailed parameter sensitivity and identifiability analysis is a critical step in improving hydrological model performance to reduce the risk of "equifinality for different parameters" while articulating all relevant hydrological processes.					wu, lei/D-3286-2017; Ma, Xiaoyi/HJH-6205-2023; Wu, Lei/JDC-4172-2023	wu, lei/0000-0002-5602-674X; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2022	29	21					31631	31645		10.1007/s11356-022-18573-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-18573-9		JAN 2022						35006572					WOS:000741630600020

However, the ecological functions of bacterivorous nematodes and their impacts together with the addition of organic materials on the activity and diversity of microorganisms in petroleum-contaminated soils remain unknown. To assess such effects, six treatments were established in this study, including uncontaminated nematodes-free soil (Control), petroleum contaminated soil (PC), petroleum-contaminated soil + 5 nematodes per gram dry soil (PCN), and petroleum contaminated soil + 5 nematodes per gram dry soil + 1% wheat straw (PCNW), or + 1% rapeseed cake (PCNR), or + 1% biochar (PCNB). Results showed that the enzyme activities in the six treatments generally increased firstly and then decreased during the incubation period. Compared with Control, the invertase activity in PCNW, PCNR, and PCNB increased by 80.6%, 313.5%, and 12.4%, respectively, whereas the urease activity in PC, PCN, PCNW, PCNR, and PCNW increased by 1.2%, 25.5%, 124.3%, 105.3%, and 25.5%, respectively. Petroleum pollution, inoculation of bacterivorous nematodes, and the addition of organic materials all significantly boosted the concentrations of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) of soil bacteria, actinobacteria, and total microorganisms, and increased the concentrations of both G+ and G- bacteria PLFAs and the ratio of G -/G+. The concentration of fungi PLFAs and the ratio of fungi to bacteria were significantly higher in PCNW and PCNR than those in other treatments. Overall, adding bacterivorous nematodes and organic materials to the petroleum contaminated soil significantly improved soil microbial activity and community structure, suggesting that bacterivorous nematodes could be used for the bioremediation in petroleum contaminated soils.

In practice, there are two kinds of commonly used tools, dynamical models and statistical models, to provide probabilistic seasonal rainfall forecasts. Dynamical models are based on physical processes but are usually expensive to operate and implement, and rely overly on initial conditions. Statistical models are easy to implement but are usually based on simple or linear relationships between observed variables. Recently, machine learning techniques have been widely used in climate projection and perform well in reproducing historical climate. For these reasons, we conducted a case study in Australia by developing a machine learning-based probabilistic seasonal rainfall forecasting model using multiple large-scale climate indices from the Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans. Rainfall probabilities of exceeding the climatological median for upcoming seasons from 2011 to 2018 were successively forecasted using multiple climate indices of precedent six months. The performance of the model was evaluated by comparing it with an officially used forecasting model, the SOI (Southern Oscillation Index) phase model (SP) operated by Queensland government in Australia. Results indicated that the random forest (RF) model outperformed the SP model in terms of both distinct forecasts and forecasting accuracy. The RF model increased the percentages of distinct forecasts to 64.9% for spring, to 71.5% for summer, to 65.8% for autumn, and to 63.9% for winter, 1.4 similar to 3.2 times of the values from the SP model. Forecasting accuracy was also greatly increased by 28%, 167%, 219%, and 76% for four seasons respectively, compared to the SP model. The proposed rainfall forecasting model is based on readily available data, and we believe it can be easily extended to other regions to provide seasonal rainfall outlooks.

We hypothesized that dietary habits of pastoralists would be influenced by their remoteness, and that changes from the traditional diet would result in deviations in the local ecological chain. To test this hypothesis, we determined the 813C and 815N values of soil, plants, and hair of animals and pastoralists (n = 885). The 813C value in human hair reflects the proportions of protein originating from C3 and C4 plants; whereas, the 815N value reflects the proportions of protein derived from plants and animals, with higher values indicating a greater consumption of meat. The isotopic signatures enabled us to estimate the variation in dietary habits of pastoralists across a socio-economic gradient of easily accessible to remote areas on the Tibetan plateau, and to determine the trophic transfer of the isotopes along an ecological chain. The trophic magnification factor (TMF) evaluated the trophic transfer of 815N in the soil-plants-animals-pastoralists ecological chain. The high 815N values in soil and plants were not recovered in animals and pastoralists in easily accessible and developed areas, indicating the use of external feed and food resources, and that they deviated from the ecological chain. The mean 813C (-22.0 %o) and 815N values (6.9 %o) of pastoralists indicated diets consisting mainly of local C3 plants and animal products. However, pastoralists in remote areas relied more on meat protein and on the local ecological chain than pastoralists in easily accessible areas, as their 815N values and trophic magnification factor of 815N in the ecological chain were greater. In addition to remoteness, per capita GDP influenced dietary changes in pastoralists, with richer pastoralists consuming more external food. We concluded that dietary changes of pastoralists in the easily accessible areas were due to external food resources and alterations in the local ecological chain of animals and plant-based foods available to the pastoralists.

The species produces large amounts of fire-prone plant mass in its habitats. The aim of this study was to assess the effect that burning of savin shrubs has on the soil seed bank (SSB), the microbial respiration and the amount of organic matter under its canopy. In each of three sampling areas, four individuals of savin were randomly selected. Under each of these individuals and on adjacent herbaceous control patches, soil samples were taken from 0 to 5 cm and 5-10 cm depths for SSB, biological and chemical analyses. The sampling was repeated after burning the canopy. We found that the immediate effects of burning on the SSB and on the biological and chemical soil parameters were significantly negative. In particular, SSB density, magnitude of microbial respiration and amount of organic matter were significantly decreased after savin canopy burning in 0-5 cm depth, while these changes were less pronounced on the burned herbaceous patches. Hence the restoration of gaps created by burning savin cannot rely on the SSB. Furthermore, alkalization of the soil and decreased soil quality caused by savin burning might hamper the vegetation recovery even in the medium to long run.

In light of studies that report the missing links to be (i) effective collaborations between researchers and practitioners and (ii) interdisciplinary working, we promote the benefits of Watershed Science to address these gaps. Watershed Science incorporates basin hydrology, determines water resource thresholds, promotes water governance that forms partnerships between institutions, and enacts participatory decision making in water resources management. However, such partnerships must recognize the differential power and interests of different actors to ensure that outcomes are not skewed in favour of particular interests.

J	Gong, C; Tan, QY; Liu, GB; Xu, MX				Gong, Chen; Tan, Qingyue; Liu, Guobin; Xu, Mingxiang			Impacts of mixed forests on controlling soil erosion in China	CATENA												Soil erosion poses a major threat to the sustainability and stability of global terrestrial ecosystems. Mixed forests have more advantages in restoring degraded land and enhancing soil fertility than monocultures, but their influence on soil erosion remains uncertain. Therefore, we presented a meta-analysis consisting of 261 paired observations of mixed forests and the corresponding monocultures from 65 studies to evaluate the effect of tree diversity on soil erosion in China. The results showed that compared with monocultures, mixed forests significantly reduced the annual runoff and sediment yield by 17.4% and 23.6%, respectively. Tree-shrub mixtures showed more efficiency in reducing runoff (24.2%) and sediment yield (32.1%) than tree-tree mixtures. However, the positive effect of mixed forests on soil erosion control was significant > 20 years after stand establishment. Mixed forests showed the highest capacity to control soil erosion at slope angles of 16 degrees-25 degrees (runoff: 27.7%; sediment yield: 37.7%). In terms of soil textures, mixed forests performed better with respect to soil erosion control on sandy soils (runoff: 21.4%; sediment yield: 30.1%), whereas significant differences were not observed between different stand types on clayey soils. In addition, in the dry areas (humidity index (HI) < 30), mixed forests conferred the greatest benefits in reducing runoff and sediment yield (25.8% and 33.0%, respectively). Our results indicate that increasing tree species richness is a suitable approach to controlling soil erosion in China. This research provides a scientific basis for the management and sustainable development of forest ecosystems in the future.

Nitrogen (N) enrichment is known to affect soil microbes, but whether other factors affect the impact of N enrichment on soil microbial biomass and composition and extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) remains unclear. In this study, to evaluate the responses of soil microbial characteristics, including microbial biomass, microbial community composition and EEAs to N enrichment, we conducted a meta-analysis using 1248 global data series from 120 published papers at 125 sites that cover five types of biomes worldwide. The results showed that N enrichment significantly decreased microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) across all studies. In addition, the responses of soil microbes depended on the N enrichment rate, and different thresholds (the N rate at which the microbial response changes) of MBC (64.85 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN, 57.00 kg N ha (-1) year (-1)), bacterial biomass (106.75 kg N ha(-1) year (-1)), fungal biomass (70.50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)), beta-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG) (83.27 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and peroxidase activity (19.75 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) were observed under N enrichment. Moreover, the responses of soil microbes to N enrichment were affected by biome type, N enrichment rate and type, experimental duration, precipitation and soil type. Furthermore, the results showed that N enrichment significantly altered soil physical and chemical properties, which may affect soil microbial biomass and composition under N enrichment. Our findings highlight that N enrichment decreased the soil microbial biomass and showed a significant effect on soil EEAs across all terrestrial ecosystems, with more pronounced effects observed with increasing N rate and duration.					朱, 广宇/GQZ-5189-2022; Yan, Weiming/CAG-9069-2022; 贾, 晓宇/AHB-0724-2022	Yan, Weiming/0000-0001-5509-0806; 贾, 晓宇/0000-0001-6011-1472; ZHU, GUANGYU/0000-0002-8641-2422													0016-7061	1872-6259				MAY 1	2020	366								114256	10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114256	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114256													WOS:000524458000006

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate plant growth promotion and uncover its underlying mechanisms in salt-sensitive plants (SSP) and salt-tolerant plants (STP) with PGPR inoculation under salt stress. PGPR inoculation decreased proline, sodium ion (Na+) and malondialdehyde but increased plant biomass, nutrient acquisition (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium ion (K+), calcium ion (Ca2+), and magnesium ion (Mg2+)), ion homeostasis (K+/Na+ ratio, Ca2+/Na+ ratio, and Mg2+/Na+ ratio), osmolytes accumulation (soluble sugar and soluble protein), antioxidants (superoxide dismutase), and photosynthesis (chlorophyll, carotenoid, and photosynthetic rate) in both SSP and STP. The effect size of total biomass positively correlated with the effect sizes of nutrient acquisition and the homeostasis of K+/Na+, and negatively correlated with the effect size of malondialdehyde in both SSP and STP. The effect size of total biomass also positively correlated with the effect sizes of carotenoid and the homeostasis in Ca2+/Na+ and Mg2+/Na+ and negatively correlated with the effect size of Na+ in SSP, but it only negatively correlated with the effect size of Ca2+ in STP. Our results suggest that the plant growth improvement depends on the nutrient acquisition enhancement in both SSP and STP, while ion homeostasis plays an important role and carotenoid may promote plant growth through protecting photosynthesis, reducing oxidative damage and promoting nutrient acquisition only in SSP after PGPR inoculation under salt stress.

However, the deep soil water budget and resilience after revegetation are not clear. In this study, seven typical land-cover patterns (artificial arbor, shrub, economic tree, pasture, abandon grassland, and natural grassland) were selected in four different study sites on the Loess Plateau of China. From May 2019 to December 2020, SM was monitored daily at ten depths along a 10 m profile in situ to assess the effect of revegetation on the vertical distribution, availability, and sustainability of soil water. The results indicated that the minimum SM moved to the deeper depth in the planted forest, while the maximum SM gradually moved to a shallower and deeper depth after the conversion of cropland to forestland and grassland, respectively. The difference in soil water use strategies under different revegetation types generated the opposite effect on deep SM availability, resilience, and sustainability. Conversion of cropland to grassland realized the deep soil available water (SAW) increment by 53.3% over the entire measurement period. Besides, the grassland promoting the deep soil water resilience (SWR) and soil water storage variation (& UDelta;SWS) enhanced by 41.6% and 708.7% below 2 m depth, respectively. Whereas, compared to cropland, afforestation decreased the SAW, SWR, and & UDelta;SWS by 17.2%, 10.5%, and 570.7% below 2 m depth, respectively. Furthermore, the deep SWR and & UDelta;SWS were basically negative in the forestland, resulting in an unbalanced deep soil water budget within the year. Despite the significant disadvantages of sustaining the availability and water budget of deep soil water in artificial vegetation, constructing a reasonable land cover and vegetation structure could achieve the soil-water environment balance and the sustainable utilization of ecosystem water resources in the semiarid Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). The findings of this study provide valuable references and guidance for sustainable vegetation conservation and water resource management and provide design and optimization solutions for vegetation restoration in similar areas of arid and semiarid regions around the world.

Quantitative assessment of the effects of meadow patch coverage (MPC) on the runoff and sediment processes in alpine meadow is urgent for predicting the water conservation function of this special alpine ecosystem. Here, a field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of different meadow patch coverage through runoff and sediment processes in a typical alpine meadow on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that runoff in 30% and 60% MPC plots were 39.4% and 37.9% less than in 90% MPC plot, respectively. The sediment yield in 60% and 90% MPC plots were 77.9% and 82.1% less than in 30% MPC plot, respectively. The sediment concentration in 30% MPC in heavy rainfall scenario is 4.34 times and 6.51 times higher than that in light rainfall scenario and moderate rainfall scenario, respectively. Our results indicated that MPC presented a greater impact on sediment yield than runoff volume, although runoff was greatly affected by rainfall. The higher MPC followed the greater runoff coefficient and the lower sediment concentration. The influences of MPC on runoff and sediment yield in light rainfall scenario and moderate rainfall scenario were weaker than those in heavy rainfall scenario. It is necessary to maintain surface runoff while controlling soil loss for realizing the sustainability of alpine meadow ecosystems. Therefore, these findings may conducive to offer a theoretical guidance to achieve the combined goal of soil erosion regulation during alpine meadow degradation on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.					wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023; Wang, Yiping/IZQ-2052-2023; wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; Liu, Yu/JJE-7800-2023; wang, yue/ISA-4119-2023; ZHAO, S/IWV-4219-2023; ma, long/JHU-2289-2023; wang, juan/IUO-6218-2023; , 菜鸟刘/GOK-1944-2022; Wang, Xuezhen/IUN-6267-2023	Liu, Yu/0000-0003-0706-4026; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2021	603		C						127101	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127101		OCT 2021											WOS:000715326800031

Here, the random matrix theory (RMT)-based molecular ecological network (MEN) approach with a stable isotope labeling experiment were performed to discern the relationship between autotrophic bacterial networks with the carbon fixing ability and quantify the 13CO2 (carbon dioxide) fixation rate in different soil erosion regions (the Chinese Loess Plateau, the T groups, and the hilly red soil erosion region in Southern China, the H groups). The rates of carbon fixation (RS) were ranked in the following order: H group depositional sites (HD; 30.86 Mg C km-2 yr- 1) H group erosion sites (HE; 18.04 Mg C km-2 yr- 1) > T group depositional sites (TD; 5.00 Mg C km-2 yr- 1) > T group erosion sites (TE; 1.03 Mg C km-2 yr- 1). The results of the random forest modeling and variation partitioning analysis indicated that the bacterial co-occurrence networks were significantly associated with the carbon fixation rate (P < 0.05), and can explain 85.9% variations of carbon fixation rate in different erosion and deposition sites. With the results of multiple stepwise linear regression analysis, pH and C: N were considered to be the key abiotic factors that influenced the carbon fixing rate, which resulted in the carbon fixation rate of H groups were higher than what in T groups. Further, the ZP-plot suggested that the Proteobacteria were the keystones connecting and promoting other species to perform the C-fixing function. The statistical evidence of co-occurrence networks, which are positively associated with the autotrophic bacterial carbon fixation rate, advances the understanding of microbial networks in the function of carbon fixation.

Identifying the effect of afforestation on mineralization of OC and N as well as their temperature sensitivity at large spatial and temporal scales is essential to understand soil OC and N dynamics. In this study, we measured mineralization of soil OC and N at standard temperatures (15 and 25 degrees C) by laboratory incubation, and calculated their temperature sensitivity (Q(10)). Soil samples were collected from cropland (0 years, selected as a control) and adjacent woodlands with different afforestation age (10, 20 and 30 years) at five sites from north to south on China's Loess Plateau. The objectives were to understand how long-term afforestation affects OC and N mineralization and their Q(10) and whether such effects depend on afforestation age and soil texture. The results showed that afforestation increased OC and N mineralization, but this effect was not affected by afforestation age (10-30 years). The Q(10) of OC and N mineralization increased in the first 10 years of afforestation but decreased in the late stage. Furthermore, the increases of OC and N mineralization by afforestation were higher at sites with fine-textured soils than those at sites with coarse-textured soils. However, the Q(10) increased at sites with a relatively high sand content but decreased or remained unchanged at sites with a relatively high clay content. The changes in OC and N mineralization and their Q(10) were related to soil OC and N contents, pH and clay content. Overall, we concluded that long-term afforestation would contribute to the stability of soil OC and N in afforested ecosystems. Soil texture is an important factor controlling OC and N mineralization and their Q(10), and should be considered when predicting soil OC and N dynamics in response to temperature change in different landscapes.

The SBP suspensions (2 g/100 g) were homogenized under different HPH pressure from 0 to 100 MPa. The results indicated that the mean particle size of SBP suspensions increased after HPH treatment at 5 MPa and decreased as the HPH pressure increased from 5 to 100 MPa. The soluble dietary fiber content increased and insoluble dietary fiber decreased as the HPH pressure increased from 5 to 25 MPa. The HPH treatments under 50 and 100 MPa decreased the total dietary fiber and soluble dietary fiber contents. The water and oil holding capacities increased with the increment of HPH pressure ranged from 0 to 100 MPa. The HPH treatment increased the transition temperature and decreased the melting peak temperature. Fourier transform infrared spectra indicated that HPH had little effect on main components of SBP but decreased the intensity of characteristic bands in absorbance. The X-ray diffraction patterns showed similar tendency and HPH treatment decreased the crystallinity index. In addition, microscopic pictures revealed that homogenized samples gradually stretched and showed flake-like structures after HPH treatment.																			0023-6438	1096-1127				DEC	2020	134								110177	10.1016/j.lwt.2020.110177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.110177													WOS:000582744000096

Studying how nutrient balances of these biotic and abiotic players vary across temperature gradients is important when predicting ecosystem changes on a warming planet. The respective responses of plant, soil and microbial stoichiometric ratios to warming have been observed, however, whether and how the stoichiometric correlations among the three components shift under warming has not been clearly understood and identified. In the present study, we have performed a meta-analysis based on 600 case studies from 74 sites or locations to clarify whether and how warming affects plant, soil and microbial stoichiometry, respectively, and their correlations. Our results indicated that: (1) globally, plants had higher C:N and C:P values compared to soil and microbial pools, but their N:P distributions were similar; (2) warming did not significantly alter plant, soil and microbial C:N and C:P values, but had a noticeable effect on plant N:P ratios. When ecosystem types, duration and magnitude of warming were taken into account, there was an inconsistent and even inverse warming response in terms of the direction and magnitude of changes in the C:N:P ratios occurring among plants, soils and microorganisms; (3) despite various warming responses of the stoichiometric ratios detected separately for plants, soils and microorganisms, the stoichiometric correlations among all three parts remained constant even under different warming scenarios. Our study highlighted the complexity of the effect of warming on the C:N:P stoichiometry, as well as the absence and importance of simultaneous measurements of stoichiometric ratios across different components of terrestrial ecosystems, which should be urgently strengthened in future studies.

Salinity may weaken the effect of P fertilization on plant growth. We investigated the interactive effects of soil P availability and salinity on plant growth, P nutrition and salt tolerance of two alfalfa (Medicago sativa) cultivars. Methods A pot experiment was carried out to grow two cultivars of alfalfa in a loess soil under a combination of different rates of added P (0, 40, 80 and 160 mg P kg(-1) soil as monopotassium phosphate) and sodium chloride (0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 g NaCl kg(-1) soil). Plant biomass, concentrations of P ([P]), sodium ([Na]) and potassium ([K]) were determined, and rhizosheath carboxylates were analysed. Key Results There were significant interactions between soil P availability and salinity on some, but not all, of the parameters investigated, and interactions depended on cultivar. Plant growth and P uptake were enhanced by P fertilization, but inhibited by increased levels of salinity. Increasing the salinity resulted in decreased plant P-uptake efficiency and [K]/[Na]. Only soil P availability had a significant effect on the amount of tartrate in the rhizosheath of both cultivars. Conclusions Increased salinity aggravated P deficiency. Appropriate application of P fertilizers improved the salt tolerance of alfalfa and increased its productivity in saline soils.

Materials and methods This study evaluated the effectiveness of silt-sized magnetite powder, a magnetic erosion tracer, in four representative erodible soils in China with distinct textures (from sandy loam to silty clay). The chi(lf) values of different magnetic tracer-tagged aggregate size ranges (> 0.05 mm) were similar based on dry aggregate analysis. Results and discussion Simulated long-term leaching tests showed that the tracer had low mobility in soil profiles. The simultaneous separation of the tracer and tested soils under surface flow scouring conditions indicates that the tracer exhibited good bonding ability with different soils. Conclusions These findings indicate that magnetite powder is suitable for erosion monitoring in China. This method may be extended to other regions over the world.

However, there is no effective commercial technology available for continuous monitoring of ammonium species in soil pore water. This work investigates an approach for real-time measurement of ammonium in soil water using near-infrared transmission spectroscopy and partial least squares regression (PLSR) for spectral analysis. The PLSR model was trained using soil pore water collected from various soils spiked with ammonium to achieve a wide concentration range. The monitoring approach was then validated through transport experiments in a soil column. The results demonstrated capabilities for real-time tracking of the temporal variation in soil ammonium concentration and potential utilization in agronomical or environmental sensing.

Near human dwellings, it might pose a risk to humans, impair sanitation, and suffer from poor welfare. Cats' popularity as companion animals complicates their population control. Thus, culling is often replaced by a fertility control method called "trap-neuter-return/release" (TNR), considered more humane Despite the extensive application of TNR, a long-term controlled study was never performed to test its effectiveness. We present a uniquely designed controlled field experiment for examining TNR effectiveness. The study was performed over a 12-y period, divided into preintervention and mixed- and full-intervention phases, and spanned a 20-km 2 urban area. Trends of cat, intact-female, and kitten counts, cat reproduction, and carcass reports were compared among study phases and areas with different neutering intensities. The cat population increased during the first two study phases and did not decline in highly neutered populations, presumably due to cat immigration. Expansion of high-intensity neutering to the entire city in the full-intervention phase (>70% neutering percentage) reversed cat population growth, reaching an annual approximately 7% reduction. This population reduction was limited by a rebound increase in cat reproduction and longevity. We conclude that cat population management by TNR should be performed with high intensity, continuously, and in geographic contiguity to enable population reduction. To enhance management effectiveness and mitigate compensatory effects, we recommend further evaluating an integrated strategy that combines TNR with complementary methods (e.g., vital resource regulation, ill cat euthanasia, and adoption).

Studying the burrows structure and their effects on soil water movement may be crucial for exploring earthworm ecological functions and improving water use efficiency in farmlands in semi-humid areas. It was an experiment taken to assess the impact of anecic earthworm Metaphire guillelmi on the characteristics of soil macropore and soil water content (SWC). Earthworms with different densities (0, 3 and 10 in. in each column) were introduced in soil columns (height 38 cm, diameter 23 cm) for 33 days. The macropore characteristics were determined by X-ray computed tomography (CT). Results showed that increasing earthworm density increased the macroporosity and macropore number. The macropore number in the high-density earthworm treatment (HDE) was 1.3 times larger than that in columns with low-density earthworm (LDE). The diameter of soil macropores ranged from 2.12 mm to 7.30 mm. The mean macroporosities in HDE and LDE treatments were 1.35 % and 0.61 %, respectively. The soil pore morphology (mean macropore circularity, branch, junction and connectivity) was also improved by earthworms. The high number of macropores (45.30/N) and connectivity (0.05 cm(-3)) were observed in the column with high density of earthworms. Earthworms improved the soil macropores and macroporosity. The SWC linearly decreased with increasing earthworm density. A significant difference (P < 0.05) of SWC was observed between columns with earthworm (LDE and HDE) and those without earthworm (CK), especially at the 10-30 cm soil depth. The burrows generally open to the soil surface and increased water vapour transfer channels, thus accelerated soil evaporation. In areas with uneven rainfall, high earthworm density could aggravate the risk of seasonal drought at the plough layer, which is an important threaten for crop growth and yield.					wu, yunhui/JGD-6838-2023; lin, qing/JED-5250-2023														0167-8809	1873-2305				MAY 1	2021	311								107338	10.1016/j.agee.2021.107338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107338		JAN 2021											WOS:000620791400009

In this study, fine root biomass (FRB) and their carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations were measured from dominant forests along environmental gradients in Northwestern China. The results showed that forest type (coniferous vs. broadleaved, and plantation vs. secondary forest) and climatic factors had no effects on FRB. FRB was only correlated with soil P, C:P and N:P in coniferous forests and N:P in secondary forests. Thus, forest type, soil C:N:P stoichiometry and climatic factors were less important to FRB. The fine root C and C:N and C:P were higher, and N and P were lower in coniferous than in broadleaved forests. Only fine root N concentration was higher in plantations than in secondary forests. The fine root C was positively correlated with soil C, N and C:N, C:P and N:P except in coniferous forests. The fine root N was negatively correlated soil C:N, C:P and N:P in plantations and C:N in broadleaved forests, but positively correlated with soil C, N, C:P and N:P in secondary forests. The fine root P was positively correlated with soil P in plantations and in coniferous forests, but negatively correlated with soil C:N, C:P and N:P in all forest types. The fine root C in broadleaved and in secondary forests was positively correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) and fine root N and N:P in plantations were negatively correlated with MAP. Only the fine root P and C:P in broadleaved forests were correlated with mean annual temperature (MAT). Collectively, forest type, soil C:N:P stoichiometry and climatic factors explained 29, 13 and 12% of the variation in the fine root C, N and P, and their most important explanatory variables were leaf form, soil C:N and soil C:P, respectively. These results advance our knowledge about the regional fine root stoichiometry and its driving factors and provide basic data for improving the key below-ground parameters for biogeochemical models.

Hu sheep were introduced to this region in the 1970s and are raised mainly in feedlots. We hypothesized that the dietary energy utilization would differ between breeds and predicted that Altay sheep would be more efficient than Hu sheep, in particular at a low air temperature. To test this prediction, we examined growth performance, apparent digestibilities, rumen fermentation and serum metabolites in Altay (32 +/- 2.6 kg) and Hu sheep (31 +/- 2.7 kg) at air temperatures of -5 and 20 degrees C. Average daily gain (ADG), feed and metabolizable energy intakes were greater in Altay than in Hu sheep (p < .01), and all were greater at -5 degrees C than 20 degrees C (p < .01). Body mass gain-to-feed intake ratio was higher in Altay than in Hu sheep (p < .001), but was not affected by air temperature (p > .10). Rumen total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration was greater in Hu than in Altay sheep (p < .05) and was greater at 20 degrees C than at -5 degrees C (p < .05), while rumen microbial protein concentration was greater in Altay than in Hu sheep (p < .05). Rectal temperature was higher at -5 degrees C than 20 degrees C (p < .05) and was similar between breeds (p > .05). Serum glucose, non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and urea-N concentrations were higher in Hu than in Altay sheep (p < .05). It was concluded that Altay sheep are better able to cope with poor quality diets as they had higher digestibility of nutrients, ADG and body mass gain-to-feed intake ratio than Hu sheep.

A better understanding of biomass trade-off (biomass allocation between aboveground [AGB] and belowground [BGB]) change with alpine grassland degradation could uncover the degradation processes and its underlying mechanisms. We surveyed the plant and soil characteristics of alpine meadow (AM) and alpine steppe (AS) at varying degradation levels on the plateau. In the AM, the AGB was only reduced when very severely degraded, but the BGB declined at any level of degradation. In the AS, the AGB showed no significant difference in the slightly, moderately, and severely degraded levels, and the AGB only significantly declined in the very severely degraded, whereas the BGB was nonsignificantly higher in the slightly degraded and gradually declined when the levels changed from slightly to very severely degraded. In the undegraded grasslands, the biomass trade-off was towards AGB and BGB in AS and AM, respectively. With degradation, the biomass trade-off shifted from AGB to BGB at the slightly degraded levels and then gradually reached zero trade-off at the very severely degraded level in the AS. In the AM, the trade-off gradually reached zero as moderately degraded progressed to very severely degraded level. The change in plant community composition and bulk density affected the biomass trade-off change independently with AM degradation, whereas only soil moisture, soil nitrogen, and soil pH interactively influenced the biomass trade-off change with AS degradation. Our results suggest different AGB and BGB change processes and mechanisms with AS and AM degradation.

These processes depend on soil management, e.g., tillage and straw addition. Microbial mechanisms underlying the effects of straw addition on N2O emissions were investigated by 56-day incubation of soil from a long-term (27-year) no-tillage (NoTill) and conventional tillage (ConvTill) field experiment. The abundance of N functional genes (amoA, amoB, nirK, nirS and nosZ) in no-tillage and conventional tillage soils was analysed based on straw addition. The application of N-15-labelled straw allowed us to trace N2O sources. Conventional tillage with N-15-labelled straw (ConvTill+Straw) reduced N2O emissions derived from soil by 42 %, whereas no-tillage with N-15-labelled straw (NoTill+Straw) reduced N2O emissions by only 8 % compared with soil without straw addition. The N2O emissions derived from straw were higher under NoTill+Straw than under ConvTill+Straw, whereas they accounted for only similar to 4 % of the total N2O emissions under both conditions. The nirK and nirS gene abundances were higher than those in soil without straw addition. Compared to that under ConvTill, the nosZ gene abundance was higher and the N2O emissions were 40 % lower under ConvTill+Straw, indicating its strong capacity to reduce N2O to N-2. Pathway analysis showed that gene (amoA and nirK) abundance combined with soil properties (particulate organic matter nitrogen (POMN) and NO3) were the main factors affecting N2O emissions, with increased POMN and nirK abundance driving increased N2O production under NoTill+Straw. However, gene (amoA, amoB, nirS and nosZ) abundances affected N2O emissions, with the nosZ gene being the main factor decreasing N2O under ConvTill+Straw. These findings revealed that straw return suppressed N2O emissions in conventional tillage soil, which may mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

Because of improper parameter settings, most sprayers deliver either too much or too little pesticide. To identify appropriate sprayer parameters for kiwifruit trees, the vertical distribution profiles of the applied liquid spray were examined in this study. The effects of spray fan speed (SFS), spray pressure (SP) and spray distance (SD) on the distributions of the sprayed liquid in the vertical profiles were studied. Combined actions of the above parameters were systematically analysed using the quadratic general rotary design test method. Regression equations for the spray liquid distributions and working factors are presented. Field confirmation experiments were carried out to optimize the parameters. Data analysis showed that the optional sprayer working parameters are those of Group 3, with an SFS equal to 1900 r/min and SP equal to 3.25 MPa. The results of this study provide a reference for future applications of this type of axial air-assisted sprayer in kiwifruit orchards.																			1934-6344	1934-6352				MAR	2020	13	2					81	91		10.25165/j.ijabe.20201302	http://dx.doi.org/10.25165/j.ijabe.20201302													WOS:000527763700011

While the relationship between revegetation and soil C-N-P stoichiometry remains unclear. To evaluate the relationships between vegetation restoration and soil C-N-P stoichiometry, the distribution of soil C, N, and P within 0-30 cm soil depth under five typical artificial restored vegetation types on the Loess Plateau was analyzed and the influencing factors were evaluated. The results showed that soil C, N, and P contents were relatively lower at the study site than the mean values for topsoil in China. Compared with other vegetation types (Populus simonii Carr., Pinus tabuliformis Carr., and Caragana korshinskii Kom.), Medicago Sativa L. and Stipa bungeana Trin. helped improve soil fertility better; the soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) contents within the 0-30 cm soil layer respectively maximized under Stipa bungeana Trin. (3.30 g kg(-1)), Medicago Sativa L. (0.34 g kg(-1)), and Medicago Sativa L. (0.41 g kg(-1)). The values of soil C/N, C/P, and N/P for the five vegetation types were 9.50-11.85, 15.36-21.47, and 1.29-1.90, respectively. The contents of SOC and TN under the five vegetation types were significantly (P < 0.001) affected by soil depth and vegetation type (P < 0.001) and decreased with increasing soil depth. However, the TP content was significantly (P < 0.001) affected by vegetation type and not by soil depth. Considering the better adaptability of native species, native herb vegetation types should be considered first for ecological restoration in semiarid continental climate zones.

It is pivotal to identify the source of N2O for reducing N2O emission, but estimating microbial pathways of N2O production is very difficult due to the existence of N2O reduction. A promising tool can address this problem by using delta O-18 and delta N-15(SP) of N2O to construct a dual isotopocule plot. For ascertaining the microbial pathways of N2O production and consumption in soil fertilized for vegetable production, four treatments were set up: urea (U), half urea and half organic fertilizer (UO), organic fertilizer (O) and no fertilizer (NF), and the experiment was carried out continuously for two years. The delta O-18 vs. delta N-15(SP) plot method indicated that the nitrification/fungal denitrification was a dominant in N2O emission, and the U treatment was the highest, followed by OU, O and NF in the both years. Among the different treatments, furthermore, the N2O flux had the same trend, whereas the extent of N2O reduction showed an opposite trend. Overall, inorganic fertilizer enhances nitrification/fungal denitrification and hinders reduction of N2O to N-2, resulting in a larger amount of N2O emission. However, organic fertilizer increases the contribution of denitrification and greatly improves the extent of N2O reduction, which helps to reduce N2O emission. Therefore, organic fertilizer is crucial to reducing N2O emission by enhancing N2O reduction and should be properly applied in production practice. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of thawed soil depth on rill erosion and to quantify the functional relationship between rill length and erosion. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to measure sediment delivery under four slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees, three flow rates of 1, 2, and 4 L/min, and three thawed depths of 1, 2, and 5 cm at nine slope lengths of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 m. Each individual experimental run harvested four runoff samples to measure sediment concentration. A total of 3,888 data points were produced. The experimental data showed that sediment concentrations along the rill can be well fitted with piecewise functions of linear and exponential sections. The sediment concentrations on the slopes of shallow-thawed depths of 1 and 2 cm initially increased linearly before exponentially increasing with rill length. Under condition of 5 cm thawed depth, the sediments exponentially increased with slope length. The lack of sediment supply over partially thawed soil slope determined the linear increase in sediment at the initial slope part. When water flow traveled a certain slope length to pick up sufficient sediments, the sediment concentration started to increase exponentially. The sediment concentration increased with slope gradient and flow rate. A longer slope was needed to achieve a higher maximum sediment concentration on a shallower thawed depth, a gentler soil slope, and a higher flow rate. The experimental datasets and their functional relationship can supply the basis for estimating the model parameters of rill erosion, such as soil detachment rate and soil erodibility, on partially thawed frozen-soil slope.

We quantified the responses between microtopography and the amount of erosion on overland sand slope and loess slopes through an indoor artificial simulated rainfall experiment. Three continuous rainfall tests under 1.5 mm/min rain intensity were used to analyze the spatial variation of slope microtopography and soil erosion with three-dimensional laser scanning technology. Our results show that under 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 cm sand-covered slopes, the runoff time of the first rainfall is delayed by 18, 19, and 23 min, respectively, compared with the loess slope. Furthermore, the average sediment concentration on the slope decreased with subsequent rainfall events. The total erosion of the slope under 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 cm sand was 4.24, 3.57, and 5.40 times that of the loess slope, respectively. The erosion of the sand-covered slopes was much larger than that of the loess slope. The length of the main sand production area was about 2.4 times that of the loess slope and the peaks of the erosion amount of the slope were mostly distributed in the lower part of the slope. As the rainfall progressed, the microtopographic factors of the loess slopes increased significantly (p < 0.05), and the microtopographic factors of the sand slopes increased, but not significantly (p > 0.05). We found that the microtopographic factors with the strongest erosion responses to the loess slope and the sand-covered slope were surface incision and surface roughness. The response relationship between microtopographic variation and erosion of the loess slope was stronger than the sand-covered slope, and suggests that other, unaccounted-for factors may be affecting the erosion of sand-covered slopes. This study provides a reference for erosion mechanisms of the wind-water erosion crisscross region.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Regardless of lithology and plant cover, chemical composition of floodwater in the Negev show a consistent enrichment in K+ and Mg2+ ions, which could not have been explained by the rock or clay minerals or (due to the scarcity of plants) by plant decomposition. Hypothesizing that rock-dwelling (lithobionts) or soil (loess)-dwelling biocrusts may shed light on the phenomena, we conducted sprinkling experiments in the Negev Highlands. Sprinkling was conducted on 4 types of lithobionts: cyanobacteria which inhabit the south-facing bedrock (ENC), epilithic lichens, inhabiting the inclined (EPIi) and the flat (EPIf) north-facing bedrocks, and endolithic lichens (ENL) inhabiting south-facing boulders. Additional sprinkling took place on two types of soil biocrusts, a mixed crust composed of cyanobacteria, lichens and mosses at the north-facing footslope and a cyanobacterial crust at the more xeric south-facing footslope. The runoff water (of 5 and for 4 plots for each lithobiont and soil biocrust type, respectively) was analyzed for the ionic composition of Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, NH4+, Cl, SO42, and NO3, whereas HCO3 was calculated. In comparison to rainwater, all habitats (except for K+ in ENL) showed high enrichment ratios (ERs) in K+ and Mg2+, which, unlike the high ERs of the other ions (such as SO42 that may stem from gypsum dissolution), could not have been explained by the rock lithology, clay or dust composition. It is suggested that following wetting, K+, serving for osmoregulation of cells, is released by the crust organisms, being thus responsible for K+ enrichment, while chlorophyll degradation is responsible for Mg2+ enrichment. It is suggested that rock-and soil-dwelling microorganisms may explain K+ and Mg2+ enrichment in runoff and floodwater and subsequently in groundwater of the Negev, and possibly in other arid zones worldwide, affecting in turn the quality of irrigation and drinking water.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 10	2024	911								168753	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168753		NOV 2023						37996037					WOS:001126671000001

However, microbial enzyme-mediated SOM degradation and nutrient cycling are mainly reflected in the kinetic parameters of these enzymes. Changes in the composition and structure of plant communities are typically accompanied by alterations in soil ecological functions. Therefore, it is important to clarify the kinetic parameters of soil enzymes and their temperature sensitivity in response to vegetation succession, especially under the current trend of climate change-related global warming; however, these are still understudied. Here, we examined the kinetic parameters of soil enzymes, their temperature sensitivity, and their associations with environmental variables over long-term (approximately 160 years) vegetation succession on the Loess Plateau using a space-for-time substitution method. We found that the kinetic parameters of soil enzymes changed significantly during vegetation succession. Specific response characteristics varied depending on the enzyme. Overall, the temperature sensitivity (Q10, 0.79-1.87) and activation energy (Ea, 8.69-41.49 kJ center dot mol-1) remained stable during long-term succession. Compared with N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and alkaline phosphatase, f3-glucosidase was more sensitive to extreme temperatures. In particular, two kinetic parameters (i.e., maximum reaction rate, Vmax; half-saturation constant, Km) of f3-glucosidase were decoupled at low (5 degrees C) and high (35 degrees C) temperatures. Overall, Vmax was the primary determinant of variations of enzyme catalytic efficiency (Kcat) during succession, and soil total nutrients had a greater impact on Kcat than available nutrients. Our results suggested that soil ecosystems played an increasingly important role as a C source during long-term vegetation succession, as indicated by the positive responses of the C cycling enzyme Kcat, while the factors related to soil N and P cycling remained relatively stable.					li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; Liu, Yiwei/JUF-2477-2023; Zhang, Lanyue/JNS-8209-2023; lei, lei/JSL-3106-2023; zhang, yan/JGL-8022-2023; Yang, Min/JPY-3791-2023; wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023; xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; Yao, Chen/JVD-6226-2023														0048-9697	1879-1026				JUL 15	2023	882								163542	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163542	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163542		APR 2023						37076007					WOS:001033750200001

Responses of root water uptake to soil water dynamics for three revegetation species on the Loess Plateau of China	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												In water-limited ecosystems, soil water regulates root water uptake (RWU) strategies. However, RWU responses to soil water changes under different species are not well-understood. We assessed RWU responses of three revegetation species [shrub (Hippophae rhamnoides Linn.), coniferous forest [Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco], and broad-leaved forest (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) during the dry (May to June) and rainy (July to August) seasons in 2020 on the Loess Plateau using stable isotope methods. We sampled soil and xylem for each species at approximately weekly intervals and used the MixSIAR model to quantify RWU contribution with stable water isotopes. The results indicated that soil water in the shallow (0-40 cm) and middle (40-200 cm) soil layers fluctuated more strongly than the deep soil layer (200-300 cm) due to precipitation and evapotranspiration. Before precipitation in the dry season, most of the RWU for H. rhamnoides and R. pseudoacacia (97% and 98%) came from the middle layer under limited soil water. After precipitation in the dry season, the three species had similar RWU responses to soil water changes. After precipitation in the rainy season, the RWU change of H. rhamnoides and R. pseudoacacia with deep soil drying was more sensitive to soil water change than P. orientalis with sufficient deep water on August 3 and 11, while, the RWU of H. rhamnoides was more sensitive to soil water change than R. pseudoacacia on August 11 and 19. Thus, by switching its water-use strategy, H. rhamnoides adapted better to the soil water environment than P. orientalis and R. pseudoacacia. This finding will help in selecting the optimal revegetation species for water use in a changing climate environment.					wu, wenjie/IUN-9258-2023; Si, Bing Cheng/H-8745-2012; Siddique, Kadambot H.M./B-3462-2011	Si, Bing Cheng/0000-0002-7497-5033; Siddique, Kadambot H.M./0000-0001-6097-4235; Tao, Ze/0000-0002-7656-5388; Chen, Guangjie/0000-0002-4518-7038													1085-3278	1099-145X				2023 FEB 19	2023										10.1002/ldr.4602	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4602		FEB 2023											WOS:000934855400001

However, the responses of river sediment load to climate change, especially climate extremes have not been well understood due to a lack of comprehensive assessment. This study investigated the temporal trends and spatial patterns of sediment load at 70 hydrological stations during the period of 1956-2019 in ten major river basins in China. Both the partial linear square regression model and the double mass curve method were used to quantify the contribution of key climatic indices and anthropogenic driving forces. Overall, the annual total sediment load exhibited a significant negative trend (P < 0.01), decreasing from 1842.18 Mt/yr in 1960 s to 322.72 Mt/yr in 2010 s (82.48 %). The significant decline of sediment load was particularly obvious in the Yangtze River basin and the Yellow River basin. The abrupt changes of sediment load mostly occurred in 1985-2000. Human activities were primarily response for sediment load changes in most basins. The sediment load in mainstream was mainly regulated by reservoirs, while the tributaries were largely affected by soil and water conservation measures. Intensive human activities have led to substantial changes in land surface and resulted in weakened correlation between sediment load and climate extremes. Generally, precipitation, erosive rainfall and precipitation amount in flood period were closely related to sediment load. In the Southwest River basin and Northwest River basin, the sediment load had a relatively good relationship with extreme temperature, which was related to alpine snowmelt and permafrost degradation due to climate warming. This study provides good insights for a better understanding of the interaction between river sediment load and climate extremes variables, which will be valuable for decision-making in river basin management.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	2023	617		B						128962	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128962	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128962		DEC 2022											WOS:000916003200001

In this study, concentration, distribution, stocks of Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorous (P), and ecological stoichiometry were studied in three common forest types: Masson pine natural forests (MPNF), Masson pine plantation forests (MPPF), and Slash pine plantation forests (SPPF) in a karst region of southwestern China. Results showed that N concentrations were higher in overstory than in understory and litter in the studied forests. However, P concentration was relatively low in overstory component of the forested ecosystems. Meanwhile, the N and P concentrations were higher in SPPF in the stem and litter, while these contents were higher in MPPF and MPNP in the overstory and understory. The N and P stocks ranged from 5.7-6.2 t ha(-1), and 0.5-0.6 t ha(-1) in the examined forests. The ecological stoichiometry of C:N:P in the three forest types was similar in litter (46-49:2:1), and relatively steady in soil (250-320:13-16:1) and tree leaf (100-200:14-20:1). Soil P status was the primary limiting factor in affecting tree growth in MPPF and SPPF (N:P ratio > 16), while both N and P conditions were the main restrictive factors in MPNP (N:P ratio = 15) in the study area. Our study provides scientific references and useful datasets of C:N:P stoichiometry for sustainable management of forest ecosystems in karst regions.

In this study, three hybrid models (ACO-SVM, CS-SVM, and GWO-SVM) based on ant colony optimization (ACO), cuckoo search (CS) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithms were proposed to optimize support vector machine (SVM) for predicting Rs in four climate zones of China (temperate continental zone TCZ, mountain plateau zone MPZ, temperate monsoon zone TMZ, and subtropical monsoon zone SMZ). They were compared with the standalone backpropagation neural network model, decision tree, and support vector machines. The results demonstrated that among the standalone models, support vector machines performed best with the highest accuracy in Rs estimation in each climate zone of China, followed by the decision tree and back-propagation neural network models, with a coefficient of determination (R2) in 0.707-0.882, 0.694-0.881, and 0.681-0.850, respectively. In contrast, the hybrid models exhibited higher accuracy than standalone support vector machines in four climatic regions of China, with the coefficient of determination (R2) increasing by 5.361%, 5.476%, 7.382%, and 10.965%, respectively. Among hybrid models, GWO-SVM performed better than CS-SVM, and both had higher accuracy than ACO-SVM, with the coefficient of determination (R2) in 0.809-0.927, 0.804-0.926, and 0.793-0.930, respectively. Therefore, the hybrid models (ACO-SVM, CS-SVM, and GWO-SVM), especially GWO-SVM and CS-SVM, can significantly improve the accuracy for predicting Rs in various regions of China.					wang, zhihui/HSF-6639-2023	Zhu, Feiyu/0000-0001-6863-7137; Cui, Ningbo/0000-0002-9437-7284													0959-6526	1879-1786				JAN 20	2023	385								135589	10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135589	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135589		DEC 2022											WOS:000913756800001

However, the microbial processes for N2O production and consumption after combined applications of organic and inorganic fertilizers to vegetable field remain unclear making the optimal fertilization scheme less accurate. To address this issue, five substitution rates of organic fertilizer for inorganic fertilizer including 0 (0M), 20 (20M), 50 (50M), 80 (80M), and 100% (100M) and a no fertilizer control (NF) were evaluated on Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis L. var). N2O fluxes, N2O isotopocule ratios, Chinese cabbage yield and environmental parameters were measured. According to the revised dual isotopocule mapping of delta O-18 vs. delta N-15(SP )(difference value of N-15 in N-alpha-N-beta-O molecule site preference), the nitrification contribution for the 100M, 80M, 50M, 20M, 0M and NF treatments were 41, 28, 33, 34, 39, and 37%, respectively, and the extent of N2O reduction were 74, 67, 48, 35, 11, and 78%, respectively. Such results suggest that denitrification was the major microbial process and was promoted by adding organic fertilizer. Increasing the substitution rates of organic fertilizer improved the extent of N2O reduction and thus mitigated N2O emission. In addition, increasing the substitution rates of organic fertilizer improved C/N ratio and N2O isotopocule deltas, yet reduced N2O emission, Chinese cabbage yield, and soil mineral nitrogen content. In all the evaluated substitution rates, the 20M treatment had the best performance in maintaining the Chinese cabbage yield and reducing the N2O emission. These findings reveal that the dual double isotopocule mapping is useful for partitioning N2O source and sink on a field scale. Adding organic fertilizer could reduce N2O emission by enhancing N2O reduction to N-2 and the 20% substitution rate of organic fertilizer is the appropriate substitution rate. Furthermore, an optimal substitution rate of organic fertilizer should be explored between 20% and 50% in later studies.

A four year study in a desert land area on the effect of irrigated, cultivated land and abandoned cropland on soil biological, chemical and physical properties	CATENA												Desert lands occupy vast areas in northwest China and have been undergoing intensive changes in land use. As land uses are considered key drivers of biogeochemical cycles in desert lands, we questioned what effects these changes are having on the biological, physical and chemical properties of the soil. We examined five different land use schemes: (1) natural desert land; (2) abandoned land that was formerly cultivated; (3) barley cultivated land; (4) alfalfa (Medicago saliva) cultivated land; and (5) Astragalus adsurgens cultivated land. The three cultivated lands were irrigated and received fertilizer. Measurements were made after 4 years of annual planting and harvesting or 4 years of cropland abandonment. In previous studies, equivocal results have been reported when examining the effect of land cultivation and land abandonment on soil properties. In the present study, total soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents increased significantly in the cultivated lands; whereas, they declined in the abandoned cropland when compared to the natural desert land. We concluded that the increase in these parameters in the cultivated fields was most likely due to the irrigation practice, which enhanced the growth of microorganisms and of plants and increased carbon sequestration. The decrease in the abandoned field was most likely due, at least in part, to the relatively short period between the land abandonment and measurements. More time was required for vegetation regrowth and increased carbon sequestration. It is recommended to consider the costs and benefits of carbon sequestration when planning agricultural management practices like growing annual crops and legume forage.

However, the effects of cultivation history on crop field water balance and optimized irrigation design were rarely studied. In this study, three typical maize (Zea mays L.) fields with different cultivation histories (i.e., old oasis maize field, OF; new maize field developed from a wetland, NFW; new maize field developed from the desert, NFD) in arid regions of Northwest China were selected, which had major differences in soil textures and GWLs. Based on one growth season (i.e., from April 30th to September 30th) in situ field monitoring (e.g., soil water content, maize growth index, meteorological data) and numerical model (HYDRUS-1D) simulation, the water balance and root water uptake deficit in these fields were quantified, and optimized irrigation schedules were proposed. During the maize growth period under the current irrigation schedule, the highest percolation was observed in OF (364 mm), followed by NFD (231 mm) and NFW (-52 mm). The soil water in NFW was obviously recharged by the capillary rise from groundwater, while the OF and NFD were not. Also, the most severe water deficit was identified in NFD, followed by NFW and OF. Compared with the current irrigation schedule, the irrigation was reduced by 65%, 45%, and 13% under the optimized irrigation amount in NFW, OF, and NFD, respectively. Furthermore, it was reduced by 84%, 61%, and 23% under both irrigation time and amount optimized in NFW, OF, and NFD, respectively. Under either optimized irrigation, the water deficit was relieved, deep percolation was reduced during the maize growth period, and less soil water was stored after maize was harvested. Especially under irrigation time and amount optimizing, the least irrigation times (4) and amount (90 mm) were applied in NFW among three fields, ascribing to a large amount of water recharge from shallow groundwater by capillary rise. Due to the soil texture differences, fewer irrigation times (6) with considerable single irrigation amount (30-70 mm) was recommended for OF with loamy soil, whereas more irrigation times (12) with less single irrigation (25-50 mm) were appropriated for NFD with sandy soil. It concluded that the effects of soil texture and GWL should be well considered for optimizing irrigation schedules.

Raya Valley livelihood Zone (RVLZ), Alagie-Offla livelihood Zone (ALOFLZ), and Tsirare Catchment Livelihood Zones (TCLZ) are among the most chronically food-insecure livelihood zones of the area due to climate variability events. This study aimed to analyze the seasonal and annual climate variability trends and their characteristics in the three livelihood zones (LZ). To analyze climate variability trends and variabilities, the monthly Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Rainfall with Station data (CHIRPS), and Enhancing National Climate Service (ENACTS) Maximum (T-max) and Minimum (T-min) Temperature data from the period 1983 to 2016 at moderate spatial resolution (4km-by-4km) were acquired from the National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia. The Mann Kendal Test (MKT), Sen's Slope Estimators (SSE), and coefficient of variation (CV) statistical tests were applied to analyze the data. The results uncovered temperature trends in the study area in line with the predicted temperature change across the globe from 0.3 degrees C in 2016 to 0.7 degrees C in the year 2035. Annual T-min of MKT and SSE indicated minimum temperature increased with statistical significance in all study LZ. The results of MKT annual T-min were 0.319, 0.301, and 0.273 degrees C in ALOFLZ, TCLZ, and RVLZ, respectively. Besides, statistical significance annual T-max is rising 0.323 degrees C per year in the TCLZ and 0.419 degrees C per year in the RVLZ. The Belg MKT records show that the T-max trend increased significantly by 0.301, 0.401, and 0.430 degrees C in ALOFLZ, TCLZ, and RVLZ, respectively. Besides rainfall trends, only the Kiremt rainfall shows significant trends with SSE magnitudes of 8.081 in the RVLZ and 8.511 in the TCLZ. However, in all LZ, high seasonal and annual rainfall variability was recorded. The Belg rainfall variability (i.e., 64.01, 69.66, and 64.85%) was higher than Kiremt (45.71, 43.95, and 46.31%) and annual (34.4, 35.12, and 31.62%) rainfall variability in ALOFLZ, TCLZ, and RVLZ correspondingly. Analysis of climate variability trends using MKT and SSE and long recorded data from uniformly distributed meteorological grids have high implications for revealed trends and characteristics of climate variability at LZ levels. The combined rapidly warming temperatures with high rainfall irregularities imply possible future effects on agricultural productivities and increasing evapotranspiration demands that will affect the agricultural productivity of smallholder farmers. Thus, agriculture development practitioners and policymakers should consider the seasonal variability of the rainfall at the livelihood zones for future productivity improvement.

J	Wang, Y; Huang, LM; Jia, XX; Zhu, YJ; Shao, MA				Wang, Yi; Huang, Laiming; Jia, Xiaoxu; Zhu, Yuanjun; Shao, Ming'an			Distribution characteristics and controls of soil organic carbon at different spatial scales in China′s Loess Plateau	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Understanding the variations and controls of soil organic carbon (SOC) at different spatial scales can help in selecting edaphic and environmental covariates that enables us to model SOC more accurately. The present study investigated the distribution characteristics and controls of SOC content at various spatial scales, including a deep soil core (204.5 m) taken from land surface down to bedrock (plot scale), two toposequences with different slope aspects (slope scale), and eighty-six soil profiles along a north-south transect under different land uses (regional scale) in China's Loess Plateau. The results showed that SOC content at different spatial scales decreased exponentially with increasing soil depth, but the rate of reduction differed at various spatial scales and in soil layers at different depths. For the deep soil core, the SOC content and the average rate of reduction with depth in the 0-15.5 m soil layer were significantly higher than the corresponding values of the 15.5-34.5 m and 34.5-204.5 m soil layers (p 0.05). For the toposequences with varying slope aspects, SOC content in the 0-50 cm soil layer declined rapidly with increasing depth; while SOC content in the 50-200 cm soil layer showed relatively no change. There was no significant difference of average SOC content at depths of 0-200 cm for forestland and grassland considering slope aspects that differed or were the same (p 0.05), following the order of farmland (4.94 +/- 1.23 g kg- 1) forestland (3.01 +/- 1.45 g kg- 1) > grassland (2.03 +/- 0.68 g kg- 1); moreover, the mean SOC content of the 0-500 cm soil profile generally decreased from south to north following the decreasing rainfall and temperature gradient. The average rates of reduction of SOC content in the 0-50 cm soil layer under different land uses (0.0807-0.1756 g kg- 1 cm- 1) were higher than the values of the 50-200 cm (0.0021-0.0154 g kg- 1 cm- 1) and 200-500 cm soil layers (0.0001-0.0017 g kg- 1 cm-). The SOC content at the plot scale at different depths positively correlated with total nitrogen content. The SOC content at the slope scale was mainly affected by soil water content and saturated hydraulic conductivity, while that at the regional scale was impacted by climate, topography and soil water/clay content. Pedotransfer functions were applied to adequately simulate and predict SOC content at different spatial scales in the studied area, which could provide a foundation to build SOC prediction models and extrapolate the various spatial scales to other loess regions worldwide. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering the scale effects for efficiently predicting the spatial patterns of SOC and can help in devising better policy to protect or enhance existing SOC stocks.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				SEP 1	2021	293								112943	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112943	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112943		JUN 2021						34102503					WOS:000677854000007

In this study, 780 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in developing fibers at 10 days post-anthesis (DPA) in Gossypium hirsutum acc. DH962 and G. hirsutum cv. Jimian 5 using RNA-seq. Of 15 stable QTL for fiber quality identified in the same two parents in previous studies, 4, 3, 6, 1, and 1 QTL were associated with fiber length (FL), fiber strength (FS), micronaire fiber elongation (FE) and fiber length uniformity ratio (FU), respectively. Integration of DEGs and QTL allowed the identification of 31 genes in 9 QTL regions, of which 25 were highly expressed in fibers based on the transcriptome datasets and 9 were preferentially expressed in different stages of fiber development. Gh_A01G0453 (GhDTX19), Gh_D07G1581 and Gh_D04G0942 were expressed specifically in 5 and 10 DPA fibers, with Gh_D04G0942 showing low expression in other tissues except pistil. Gh_D07G1799 (GhGAUT9), Gh D11G0326 (GhVPS29), Gh_D11G0333 (GhTCP14), and Gh_D11G0334 (GhNRP2) were preferentially expressed in 5 or 10 DPA fibers; Gh AO1G0397 (GhABCG10) and Gh_D07G1744 were expressed specifically in 20 and 25 DPA fibers. These results suggest candidate genes for molecular improvement of cotton fiber quality. (C) 2019 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

Cultivars	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Retrotransposons (RTNs) are a major source of genomic changes in plant genomes and, therefore, are extensively used as ideal molecular markers for genetic variability, DNA fingerprinting, and genetic mapping studies in plant species. In the present study, two RTN-based marker systems, inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphisms (IRAPs), and the retrotransposon-microsatellite amplified polymorphisms (REMAPs) were used to assess genetic variability and structure in a collection of 94 durum wheat genotypes. In general, 63 and 141 loci were amplified using 6 IRAP and 15 REMAP primers, respectively. Percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL) in the studied collection for IRAP and REMAP markers were 47.15% and 47.81%, respectively. The average of expected heterozygosity (He), number of effective alleles (Ne), and Shannon's information index (I), separately estimated based on IRAP and REMAP data, were not considerably different. A model-based Bayesian method and cluster analysis using Neighbor joining (NJ) algorithm depicted five clusters. A moderate level of inter-group genetic variability was detected among the clusters (11%) obtained from STRUCTUR software (PhiPT=0.111; P=0.001) with the vast majority of variation (89%) still uncaptured within groups. Most of the accessions and landraces from Iran aggregated together in clusters I and III with the cultivars from Turkey. Also, Iranian and foreign durum wheat landraces were assigned to different clusters or subpopulations in both clustering methods. In conclusion, the results showed that the genetic diversity of Iranian durum wheat is low and it is necessary to extend the genetic base of durum wheat germplasm in Iran.					Mandoulakani, B.

JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE												Background and aims NaHS, a donor of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is emerging as a potential signaling molecule, may regulate various physiological processes in plants. However, how soybean (Glycine max L.) responds to NaHS and rhizobia (Sinorhizobium fredii) inoculation remains unclear. Methods We explored the effects of NaHS and rhizobia on the growth rate, nodules, nitrogenase activities (NA), chlorophyll content, soluble protein content, photosynthesis (Pn), chlorophyll fluorescent parameters, endogenous H2S accumulation, l/d-cysteine desulfhydrase (GmLCD and GmDCD) gene expression, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) contents, and nutrient resorption. Results The results showed that rhizobia significantly increased the shoot, root, total dry weight, and growth rate, and NaHS promoted nodule numbers and NA in soybean. Moreover, chlorophyll content, soluble protein content, Pn, endogenous H2S accumulation, and GmLCD and GmDCD gene expression levels were promoted by NaHS and rhizobia. In addition, during all growth stages of soybean, the levels of N, P, and K and the N:P ratio in different tissues were affected by NaHS and rhizobia. Additionally, NaHS and rhizobia also significantly enhanced N resorption efficiency (NRE) and K resorption efficiency (KRE), but decreased P resorption efficiency (PRE). Conclusion Therefore, NaHS and rhizobia regulated the growth rate, nutrient stoichiometry, and nutrient resorption efficiency of soybean. These findings provide information that will be useful for predicting how NaHS and rhizobia lead to variations in nutrient uptake and nutrient conservation strategies.

However, it remains unclear how climate may affect plant richness across large spatial scales and also over long terms, for example across massive arid regions during the Quaternary and into the future. To fill this knowledge gap, we examined the long-term trends in plant species richness across vast drylands in China based on our newly developed climate-species richness models. We first generated optimal random forest models based on the relationships between the current (CUR, 1970-2000) annual, perennial, woody and total species richness and climatic variables. We subsequently hindcasted and forecasted plant species richness in five other periods: last interglacial (LIG, 120,000-140,000 years BP), last glacial maximum (LGM, about 22,000 years BP), mid Holocene (MH, about 6000 years BP), 2041-2060 (2050), and 2061-2080 (2070). Our results showed that total and herbaceous species richness exhibited similar patterns that were driven by temperature and precipitation. Both groups of species formed a transition zone between arid and semi-arid regions in all periods except LIG. In contrast, woody species richness did not form any transition zone because it was regulated mainly by temperature. Furthermore, the mean richness of herbaceous, woody and all species exhibited gradually increasing trends from LIG to 2070 across drylands in China. On the one hand, herbaceous species were much more sensitive to climate change than woody species. On the other hand, plant species richness in mountain basin systems and Taklamakan Desert regions were more sensitive to climate change than in meadows and steppes. These results shed new insights into the past and future changes in plant species richness over vast drylands and provide valuable information for future conservation efforts under global warming.

J	Ghazaryan, L; Giladi, I; Gillor, O				Ghazaryan, Lusine; Giladi, Itamar; Gillor, Osnat			The Effects of Colicin Production Rates on Allelopathic Interactions in <i>Escherichia coli</i> Populations	MICROORGANISMS												Allelopathic interactions mediated by bacteriocins production serve microorganisms in the never-ending battle for resources and living space. Competition between the bacteriocin producer and sensitive populations results in the exclusion of one or the other depending on their initial frequencies, the structure of their habitat, their community density and their nutrient availability. These interactions were extensively studied in bacteriocins produced by Escherichia coli, the colicins. In spatially structured environments where interactions are local, colicin production has been shown to be advantageous to the producer population, allowing them to compete even when initially rare. Yet, in a well-mixed, unstructured environment where interactions are global, rare producer populations cannot invade a common sensitive population. Here we are showing, through an experimental model, that colicin-producers can outcompete sensitive and producer populations when the colicin production rates are enhanced. In fact, colicin production rates were proportional to the producer competitive fitness and their overall success in out-competing opponents when invading at very low initial frequencies. This ability of rare populations to invade established communities maintains diversity and allows the dispersal of beneficial traits.																				2076-2607				NOV	2019	7	11							564	10.3390/microorganisms7110564	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms7110564								31739595					WOS:000502273600087

However, afforestation tends to consume a tremendous amount of soil moisture while increasing vegetation biomass and coverage. Although convincing evidence indicates that mixed trees have higher resistance and resilience to climate change and natural disturbance than pure trees, it is unclear how tree mixtures affect the relationship between soil water storage and tree biomass. By conducting a meta-analysis of 86 observations from 27 studies, we showed that there was a trade-off between soil water storage and tree biomass in artificially planted trees on the Loess Plateau, with an average root mean square deviation (RMSD) value of 0.22. The RMSD value between soil water storage and tree biomass for mixed trees was significantly lower than that for pure trees, and the relative benefits of the trade-off were biased toward soil water storage. In dry areas (aridity index (AI) < 0.3), the RMSD value between soil water storage and tree biomass of artificially planted trees was the highest, and this value of mixed trees was significantly lower than that of pure trees. In terms of different plantation ages, the RMSD value between soil water storage and tree biomass for mixed trees was significantly lower than that for pure trees in plantations aged >20 years. Additionally, RMSD values between soil water storage and tree biomass under different afforestation patterns were negatively correlated with the initial water storage and soil organic carbon content. Our results show that tree mixtures optimize the trade-off between soil water storage and tree biomass in arid and semiarid areas.

In this study, the effect of nine fertilization treatments (N0P0, N0P1, N0P2, N1P0, N1P1, N1P2, N2P0, N2P1, and N2P2) on soil microbial community diversity, keystone species, and construction methods in the crop rhizosphere were studied in a loess hilly area after 26 years of fertilization. The results showed that fertilization significantly increased the nutrient contents of the rhizospheric soil and root system and significantly affected microbial community composition (based on the Bray-Curtis distance) and community construction process (f3-nearest taxon index: f3NTI). The decrease in the abundance of oligotrophic bacteria (from phyla Acidobacteriota and Chloroflexi) in the keystone species of bacterial communities shifted the community construction process from homogenizing dispersal to variable selection process and was significantly regulated by soil factors (total P and carbon-N ratio). However, the decrease in the abundance of keystone species (from phylum Basidiomycota) in the fungal communities did not have a significant effect on community construction, which was mainly affected by root characteristics (root N content and soluble sugar). This study found that long-term N and P fertilization changed the keystone species composition of bacterial communities by affecting the nutrient content of the rhizospheric soil, such as total P, so that the construction mode of communities changed from a stochastic to a deterministic process, and the N2 fertilization, especially the N1P2 treatment was better for increasing network stability (modularity and clustering coefficient).																			0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 1	2023	897								165239	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165239	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165239		JUL 2023						37394065					WOS:001044637600001

Compared with the well-studied natural factors of soil erosion, socioeconomic factors have just begun to be considered. The major obstacle is that the soil erosion of different crops has not been accounted for and connected to socioeconomic activities. This study adopted the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and the environmentally extended multiregional input-output (EE-MRIO) model to account for soil erosion on cropland from the production, consumption, and income perspectives at the provincial and sectoral levels in China. The results showed the major responsible agents in a synthetic view. On the production side, the Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau and surrounding hills of the Sichuan Basin, the Chinese grain bases located in northeastern and central China, and the Loess Plateau were the major regions that caused the most cropland soil erosion. On the consumption side, the national final demand for Sichuan, Yunnan, Shandong, Henan, and other provinces with high production-based cropland soil erosion (PBE) values per se pulled remarkable cropland soil erosion. On the income side, the crucial provinces into which the national primary input enabled notable cropland soil erosion were still those areas with serious cropland soil erosion. From the industrial perspective, the direct effects of human primary inputs into agriculture and the demand for agricultural products played the dominant role. In addition, Cereal and BOP (beans, oil and potatoes) were the most important among the agricultural sectors. The effects of the nonagricultural sectors, especially the manufacture of foods and tobacco (MFT) and the chemical industry (CI), on cropland soil erosion also cannot be ignored. Our results indicated that accounting from multiple perspectives could inform the better management of cropland soil erosion from a more comprehensive perspective. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to consider the accounting of cropland soil erosion in China from multiple perspectives. Tailored packages of measures should be established based on different patterns of areas with serious cropland soil erosion.

J	Fang, CY; Pan, XC; Zhang, B; Zhang, KD; Lv, XR				Fang, Chenyu; Pan, Xuncheng; Zhang, Bo; Zhang, Kuandi; Lv, Xiangru			An experimental study on the evolution law of roll wave parameters in overland flow	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Roll waves commonly occur in overland flow and have an important influence on the progress of soil erosion on slopes. This study aimed to explore the evolution and mechanism of roll waves on steep slopes. The potential effects of flow rate, rainfall intensity and bed roughness on the laws controlling roll wave parameters were investigated. The flow rates, rainfall intensities and bed roughness varied from 5 to 30 L/min, 0 to 150 mm/h, and 0.061 to 1.700 mm, respectively. The results indicate that roll waves polymerize significantly along the propagation path, and bed roughness and rainfall affect the generation and evolution of roll waves. The wave velocity, length and height decreased with bed roughness, whereas the wave frequency increased with increasing bed roughness under fixed flow rate and rainfall intensity conditions. Rainfall increased the wave velocity and wavelength and decreased the wave frequency. The wave velocity, height and wavelength tended to increase with an increasing flow rate. Rainfall promoted the generation of roll waves, whereas bed roughness had the opposite effect. The generation of roll waves is closely related to the Froude number (Fr) and flow resistance. In this experiment, the range of the Reynolds number for the roll waves generated in the laminar region was 142-416, and the range of the flow resistance coefficient was 0.64-4.85. The critical value of the Fr for flow instability in the laminar region was approximately 0.57. Exploring the generation and evolution law of roll waves is necessary for understanding the processes and dynamic mechanisms of slope soil erosion.

Despite the growing prevalence of AD in low- and middle-income countries, its physiological consequences remain overlooked in countries like Bangladesh. Therefore, we aim to assess and characterize the influence of AD on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Bangladeshi patients. A cross-sectional study comprising 184 eligible adults (83 men and 101 women; mean age, 33.46 +/- 15.44 years) was conducted at the dermatology outpatient department of Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital (a tertiary hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh). AD was determined using the UK Working Party criteria. A structured questionnaire, Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) were administered to obtain information on patient characteristics, AD severity, and HRQoL. The mean DLQI score for the entire sample was 11.29 +/- 5.27 (range, 1-26), and 51.60% reported the disease greatly affected their lives. Bivariate analysis revealed significant differences in self-rated health measures of DLQI scores in terms of self-reported AD severity, overall health, and the EASI. In multivariable regression models adjusted for patient characteristics, the self-perceived severe AD group reported significantly higher DLQI scores (coefficient = 2.72; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.38-5.05; p = 0.022) than the mild group. Concurrently, we observed a substantial increase in the DLQI scores among patients with moderate and severe EASI scores (coefficient = 1.96, 95% CI = 0.08-3.92, p < 0.05 and coefficient = 4.35, 95% CI = 1.98-6.72, p < 0.001, respectively) than in those with mild EASI scores, suggesting that HRQoL was markedly influenced by greater AD severity. These findings highlight the need for a more patient-centric approach to the management of AD in order to alleviate patient suffering and, thereby, improve HRQoL.

J	Yu, L; Gu, FX; Huang, M; Tao, B; Hao, M; Wang, ZS				Yu, Li; Gu, Fengxue; Huang, Mei; Tao, Bo; Hao, Man; Wang, Zhaosheng			Impacts of 1.5 °C and 2 °C Global Warming on Net Primary Productivity and Carbon Balance in China's Terrestrial Ecosystems	SUSTAINABILITY												Assessing potential impacts of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming and identifying the risks of further 0.5 degrees C warming are crucial for climate adaptation and disaster risk management. Four earth system models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and a process-based ecosystem model are used in this study to assess the impacts and potential risks of the two warming targets on the carbon cycle of China's terrestrial ecosystems. Results show that warming generally stimulates the increase of net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) under both representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The projected increments of NPP are higher at 2 degrees C warming than that at 1.5 degrees C warming for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios; approximately 13% and 19% under RCP4.5, and 12.5% and 20% under RCP8.5 at 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming, respectively. However, the increasing rate of NPP was projected to decline at 2 degrees C warming under the RCP4.5 scenario, and the further 0.5 degrees C temperature rising induces the decreased NPP linear slopes in more than 81% areas of China's ecosystems. The total NEP is projected to be increased by 53% at 1.5 degrees C, and by 81% at 2 degrees C warming. NEP was projected to increase approximately by 28% with the additional 0.5 degrees C warming. Furthermore, the increasing rate of NEP weakens at 2 degrees C warming, especially under the RCP8.5 scenario. In summary, China's total NPP and NEP were projected to increase under both 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming scenarios, although adverse effects (i.e., the drop of NPP growth and the reduction of carbon sequestration capacity) would occur in some regions such as northern China in the process of global warming.					wang, zhaosheng/AAX-1350-2021; TAO, BO/I-4166-2014	wang, zhaosheng/0000-0001-7307-2249; 														2071-1050				APR	2020	12	7							2849	10.3390/su12072849	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12072849													WOS:000531558100274

This study developed Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) models for maize ETc estimation in northwest China. The meteorological data and crop data from 2011 to 2012 were used to train the RF, SVM, ANN and ELM. The models' simulation accuracy was verified by using the data of 2013 under six different input combinations. The input combinations included daily data for crop coefficient (K-c), global solar radiation (R-s), wind speed (u(2)), maximum and minimum air temperatures (T-max and T-min), and maximum and minimum relative humidity (RHmax and RHmin). The results showed that the SVM model achieved the highest simulation accuracy at the seedling emergence to jointing stage and at the grouting to harvest stage of summer maize, with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging 0.701-0.895 and 0.637-0.841, mean absolute error (MAE) ranging 0.310-0.654 and 0.468-0.743 mm/d, and mean square error (MSE) ranging 0.227-0.722 and 0.513-1.227 mm/d, respectively. The ELM model achieved the highest simu-lation accuracy at the booting to silking stage and during the whole growth period, the coefficient of determi-nation (R-2) ranging 0.601-0.828 and 0.891-0.954, mean absolute error (MAE) ranging 0.418-1.194 and 0.285-0.530 mm/d, and mean square error (MSE) ranging 0.887-2.515 and 0.182-0.587 mm/d, respectively. Considering the accessibility and simulation accuracy of input parameters, the SVMI-2, ELMII-5, SVMIII-4, and ELMIV-2 models were recommended for simulating ETc at the seedling emergence to jointing stage, at the booting to silking stage, at the grouting to harvest stage, and during the whole growth period, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.796, 0.879, 0.800 and 0.896, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.416, 0.418, 0.553 and 0.328 mm/d, and mean square error (MSE) of 0.327, 0.887, 0.655 and 0.190 mm/d, respectively. In conclusion, machine learning models can accurately simulate the daily evapotranspiration of maize in northwest China.

A study was conducted to better understand the soilscapes of the Giba catchment (900-3300 m a.s.l.; 5133 km(2)) in northern Ethiopia, so as to sustain soil use and management. To characterise the chemical and physical properties of the different benchmark soils and to classify them in line with the World Reference Base of Soil Resources, 141 soil profile pits and 1381 soil augerings at representative sites were analysed. The dominant soil units identified are Leptosol and bare rock (19% coverage), Vertic Cambisol (14%), Regosol and Cambisol (10%), Skeletic/Leptic Cambisol and Regosol (9%), Rendzic Leptosol (7%), Calcaric/Calcic Vertisol (6%), Chromic Luvisol (6%) and Chromic/Pellic Vertisol (5%). Together these eight soil units cover almost 75% of the catchment. Topography and parent material are the major influencing factors that explain the soil distribution. Besides these two factors, land cover that is strongly impacted by human activities, may not be overlooked. Our soil suitability study shows that currently, after thousands of years of agricultural land use, a new dynamic equilibrium has come into existence in the soilscape, in which ca. 40% of the catchment is very suitable, and 25% is moderately suitable for agricultural production. In view of such large suitable areas, the Giba catchment has a good agricultural potential if soil erosion rates can be controlled, soil fertility (particularly nitrogen) increased, available water optimally used, and henceforth crop yields increased.

However, it remains unclear how soil microbial properties differentiate as they progressively thaw and detach from the still frozen layer as often occurs in a sloped field. In this study, a Mollisol (< 0.5 mm) was refilled into columns and frozen at -15 degrees C for 12 h. To simulate detachment while thawing, the frozen soil columns were progressively peeled off, from the outer to the inner core, into six layers (T1 similar to T6). Our results show that: (1) The soil water content significantly declined from 95.3% in the outermost layer T1 to the inner core T6 of 24.7%, whilst the soil electrical conductivity evidently increased from 45.8 mu S.cm(-1) in the T1 to 73.7 mu S.cm(-1) in the T6. (2) The six frozen-thawed layers had more observed microbial species and distinct beta diversity compared to the unfrozen CK, and the OTU-based co-occurrence network of the soil bacteria in the T1 was apparently better interconnected than that in the T6. However, the outer layers released significantly less CO2 on average than the CK and inner layers over the seven days of incubation. Although cautions must be taken in extrapolating our results to field scale processes, our study was the first (to our knowledge) to distinguish the heterogeneity of soil inter-layer microbial properties during progressive thawing. Our findings collectively suggest progressive thawing may introduce a non-negligible but long-neglected heterogeneity in carbon biogeochemistry along slopes.

J	Li, JW; Wang, KB; Shangguan, ZP; Deng, L				Li, Jiwei; Wang, Kaibo; Shangguan, Zhouping; Deng, Lei			Coupling and decoupling of soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stocks following grazing exclusion in temperate grasslands	CATENA												Grazing exclusion is considered a crucial measure for improving ecosystem structure and function, including elements such as soil carbon and nutrients. However, little is known about the relationships of soil organic C (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) stocks during long-term grazing exclusion. This study examined the SOC, TN, and TP stocks after 0-33 years of grazing exclusion in temperate grasslands on the Loess Plateau, China. The results showed that long-term grazing exclusion significantly increased SOC and TN stocks but declined TP stocks compared to those in grazing grasslands. In addition, grazing exclusion was more favorable for SOC and TN accumulations than TP accretion, and SOC and TN stocks were decoupled from TP stock. Overall, changes in SOC stock were determined by plant productivity, and TN stocks were also driven by soil microbial activities (i.e., N-acquiring enzymes). Nevertheless, plant and microbial characteristics had no effects on TP stocks following grazing exclusion. This study emphasizes the positive effect of grazing exclusion on SOC and TN accumulations, further, it is needed to explore soil phosphorus stabilization mechanisms during grassland restoration after grazing exclusion.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564													0341-8162	1872-6887				APR	2022	211								106003	10.1016/j.catena.2021.106003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.106003		JAN 2022											WOS:000790432400001

Despite compelling evidence indicating that mixed plantations can demonstrate higher vegetation productivity and carbon (C) sequestration capacity than monocultures, the effects of mixed plantations on STN stocks remain unclear. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of 128 observations from 49 peer-reviewed articles across the Loess Plateau of China to evaluate the impact of different afforestation models (i.e., mixed plantations and monocultures) on the dynamics of STN stocks in mineral soil (0-30 cm). The results showed that, compared with monocultures, mixed plantations significantly increased STN stocks by 19.3%. For different mixed types, tree-shrub mixed plantations increased more STN stocks than tree-tree mixed plantations. However, the positive effect of mixed plantations on STN stocks was significant > 20 years after stand establishment. Moreover, for areas with steeper slope (>25 degrees), lower elevation (<1200 m), and climate restricted (MAT < 8 degrees C, MAP < 500 mm), mixed plantations had more advantages in increasing STN stocks than monocultures. Additionally, the response ratio of STN stocks was negatively correlated with the initial STN stocks, response ratios of soil pH, and bulk density (BD) but positively correlated with the response ratio of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Our results demonstrate that increasing tree species richness is an important strategy to increase STN stocks.

J	Gong, C; Tan, QY; Liu, GB; Xu, MX				Gong, Chen; Tan, Qingyue; Liu, Guobin; Xu, Mingxiang			Forest thinning increases soil carbon stocks in China	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Thinning is a common forest management practice. However, its impact on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is still unknown. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of 270 measurements from 77 articles to evaluate the effect of forest thinning on SOC stocks in mineral soil (0-30 cm) across planted forests in China. The results showed that, compared to reference (non-thinned) plantations, thinning significantly increased SOC stocks in planted forests by 7.2%. Among different thinning intensities, moderate thinning (35-55% of thinning intensity) increased SOC stocks in planted forests (+16.1%) more than other levels of thinning intensity. However, the positive effect of thinning on SOC stock was significant 5 years after harvesting. In the humidity-restricted areas (humidity index (HI) < 30), the increase in SOC stocks after thinning was significantly higher than that of other areas. In addition, thinning increased the sensitivity (i.e. slope value) of soil total nitrogen (TN) stocks changes to SOC stocks. Therefore, we conclude that forest thinning strategy is potentially a viable silvicultural measure to increase SOC fixation in planted forests. Our results provide a reference for the formulation and implementation of future forest management strategies.

Ecosystem restoration can provide remarkable contributions to VCS. However, attention to the impact of soil conservation (SC) on VCS is lacking. Therefore, the Yellow River Basin, a typical area of soil erosion in the world, was chosen as the study area. The VCS and SC trends from 2000 to 2020 were analyzed and the potential response of VCS to SC was explored by adopting correlation analysis, elastic coefficient method, geographically weighted regression model, and geographical detector model. The influence of SC drivers on the spatial heterogeneity of VCS was also revealed. Results showed the following: (1) VCS and SC had a significant upward trend, especially in the eastern monsoonal ecoregion. (2) The area with a significant positive correlation between VCS and SC accounted for 31.74% of the total, mainly concentrated in the key areas of SC, wherein a 100% increase in SC would lead to a 25%-100% increase in VCS. (3) Among the SC drivers, vegetation cover and management (C) factor and rainfall erosion force (R) factor mainly influenced spatial heterogeneity in VCS, and their interaction considerably enhances this effect. Therefore, the interaction between precipitation and vegetation should be considered when evaluating the impact of water erosion management on VCS. The results of the study have important implications for the enhancement of VCS capacity of degraded land in the ecological restoration process.					wang, chen/JED-7289-2023; WANG, Bin/JGM-2639-2023; Wang, lingyu/JLM-2013-2023; Liu, Jie/JCP-1070-2023; Zhang, Yun/JCN-7026-2023	Cen, Yunfeng/0009-0007-9761-4058													1085-3278	1099-145X				2023 JUN 16	2023										10.1002/ldr.4796	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4796		JUN 2023											WOS:001009887800001

This study proposed a research framework based on the regulating role of human activities, used quantifiable complex network analysis to uncover the vital role of ur-banization in the evolution of land systems, and combined trajectory analysis of crop yield change to explore the im-pact of different urbanization modes (urban, town, and township mode) on food security through a continuous observation on 4259 township-level administrative regions of the Loess Plateau from 1990 to 2020. The findings proved that urbanization occupied the greatest land use area of cropland, and the town mode occupied 58.62 % of all urbanization modes encroaching on cropland, which has become a new pattern for advancing the urbanization de-velopment in the Loess Plateau. Construction land is more likely to be transferred in than out in the land use transfer network, while other land use types converted to construction land will be difficult to reverse. The Chinese govern-ment has implemented pragmatic policies, improved agricultural production techniques, and promoted agricultural intensification, resulting in a considerable increase in crop productivity and crop yield and the achievement of basic crop yield self-sufficiency of the Loess Plateau, so urbanization would not endanger food security. This study not only provides a more systematic research framework for related studies but also provides a theoretical basis for securing food security in other rapidly urbanizing regions of the world.

The degradation of the alpine meadow has led to a significant loss of soil organic C (SOC), which endangers its weak C sink. The change in heterotrophic respiration was hypothesized as one of the primary biological processes for the SOC loss alongside the degradation of alpine meadow. However, little is known about how land degradation impacts R-h due to changes in plant communities and consequent labile organic C inputs. R-h, vegetation productivity, plant community composition, plant lignin concentration, leaf C/N, SOC, and soil labile C (SLC) were measured for alpine meadow grasslands with five degradation levels in 2 years. Our results showed that the SOC of the surface layer (0-10 cm) gradually decreased with land degradation. The plant lignin concentration and C/N ratio gradually increased with land degradation due to the proportion of sedges decreased while that of forbs increased, which consequently led to the soil C quality (SLC) increased before the moderate degradation level (MD) while significantly reduced in severe and very severe degradation levels (SD and VSD). The structural equation modeling result (SEM) revealed that the degradation-induced change in soil C quality (SLC) due to an alteration in plant community composition relates to the R-h change with grassland degradation, and the R-h (C output) and aboveground biomass (AGB: C input) further mediated the loss of SOC alongside alpine meadow degradation. On average, R-h increased by 49% and 59% from the Intact to slight degradation level (SLD) and MD and reduced by 56% and 69% from MD to SD and VSD. The temperature sensitivity of R-h (Q(10)) was higher in the SLD (Q(10) = 2.84) and MD (Q(10) = 2.62) comparing with the Intact (Q(10) = 2.58) respectively, but it was lower in SD (Q(10) = 2.19) and VSD (Q(10) = 1.65). AGB and belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) had no significant change until the MD, while reduced by 60%-90% in SD and VSD. Our results suggest that R-h and its Q(10) change moderated by soil C quality alteration due to the plant community shifting could be one mechanism for the soil C loss before MD, but could not be the main pathway for the SOC loss at SD and VSD.					zhang, wenjuan/A-9413-2011	zhang, wenjuan/0000-0002-9704-766X; Xue, Xian/0000-0003-1795-8656; Li, Chengyang/0000-0001-7166-8313													1085-3278	1099-145X				DEC	2021	32	18					5322	5333		10.1002/ldr.4111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4111		OCT 2021											WOS:000707194500001

Y.; Yu, Qiang; Yang, Yang			Standards for environmental flow verification	ECOHYDROLOGY												Healthy river ecosystems are conducive to the sustainable use of water resources. As the climate change and human activities become more intense, the integrity of such ecosystems is seriously threatened. The maintenance of enough environmental flow (e-flow) for river ecosystems is the most effective way of protecting river health. Accurately and reasonably estimating e-flow is essential for river health maintenance. So far, few methods can quantitatively verify the e-flow results calculated by various e-flow methods, which reduces the success rate of ecological restoration projects on a global scale. Therefore, the Tennant method, wetted perimeter (WP) method, and adapted ecological hydraulic radius (AEHRA) method have been recognized by many scholars. The article used the combination of these three methods to calculate the e-flow and its meeting rate (actual flow/e-flow) and formed a new framework to verify e-flow results. First, the Shannon diversity index, index of biological integrity (IBI), and river health index are used to evaluate river health status. Then, we studied the relationship between e-flow meeting rates and three indices using field monitoring data on hydrology, water quality, and biological communities. Finally, we investigated the effects of different e-flow calculation methods on river health. Results show that the e-flow in the centre of the study area calculated by the Tennant and WP methods are relatively high (48.33-317 m(3)/s), whereas lower e-flow (0.03-21 m(3)/s) are observed in its southern and northern parts. The e-flow in the southern mountain area calculated by the AEHRA method (1.42 m(3)/s) is higher than those in the other regions determined by the same method. Furthermore, the highest values of river health-the Shannon diversity index (3.19), IBI (67.47), and river health index (0.65)-appear in mountainous areas that are less affected by human activities. The lowest values appear in the urban areas with river health values (0.97, 14.54, and 0.45, respectively) with high population density. For the river health scores, the values of the Shannon diversity index and IBI first increase and then decrease with the increase in the e-flow meeting rates. The values of river health index continuously increase with the increase in the WP- and AEHRA-calculated e-flow meeting rate and fluctuate with the increase of Tennant-calculated e-flow meeting rate. We concluded that the adoption of WP- and AEHRA-calculated e-flow values can maintain the health of river ecosystems with a certain degree of pollution, whereas the Tennant-calculated e-flow can only ensure the health of river ecosystems with little pollution, the reason for which is the pollution-affected relationships between river biota communities and stream flows, and the Tennant method uses historical stream flow records to calculate e-flow. WP and AEHRA methods, on the other hand, do not rely on flow records. The methodologies and results can provide a scientific basis for the selection of suitable e-flow methods and therefore facilitate the projects for ecological river restoration.

Design of novel thiazolothiazole-containing conjugated polymers for organic solar cells and modules	SOLAR ENERGY												One of the major challenges in the field of organic photovoltaics is associated with high-throughput manufacturing of efficient and stable organic solar cells. Practical realization of technologies for production of large-area organic solar cells requires the development of novel materials with a defined combination of properties ensuring sufficient reliability and scalability of the process in addition to good efficiency and operation stability of the devices. In this work, we designed two novel polymers comprising thiazolothiazole units and investigated their performance as absorber materials for organic solar cells and modules. Optimized small-area solar cells based on P1/[70]PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester) blends exhibited promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.5%, while larger area modules fabricated using slot die coating showed encouraging PCE of 4.2%. Additionally, the fabricated devices showed promising outdoor stability maintaining 60-70% of the initial efficiency after 20 sun days being exposed to natural sunlight at the Negev desert. The obtained results feature the designed polymer P1 as a promising absorber material for a large-scale production of organic solar cells under ambient conditions.

One of the common complications is the effectiveness of topographic data with different resolutions or the compatibility of topographic data originated from different sources. In this study, the topographic data from five common sources, 5-m digital elevation model (DEM) based on 1:10,000 topographic maps (5-m topo DEM of 1:10,000), 25-m DEM derived from 1:50,000 topographic maps (25-m topo DEM of 1:50,000), 30-m ASTER GDEM, 30-m and 90-m SRTM DEMs, were individually applied to calculate the IS factors of five catchments with distinct terrain characteristics. Our results show that the computation accuracy of the IS factors in the five study catchments decreased with greater grid sizes derived from the five topographic data sources. Compared to the most precision 5-m topo DEM of 1:10,000, the relative computation error of the mean LS factors was less than 10% when calculated from the 25-m topo DEM of 1:50,000, and that was less than 25% from the 30-m ASTER and 30-m SRTM DEMs. For scenarios in gently rolling areas, the 90-m SRTM DEM with the relative computation error less than 15% could be recommended when there are noises on the open sources DEMs surface. Therefore, depending on the requirements of data accuracy, different data sources can be applied individually or in combined to obtain the optimal predictions of the LS factors. However, such recommendations on data sources proposed in this study appeared to be more applicable for regions with complex terrains. Further studies over a range of terrain features and spatial scales are required to validate the effectiveness of different topographic data sources in calculating the LS factor.

However, there are few studies comparing WUE at leaf and ecosystem levels in response to environmental variables on a global scale. Here, we compare global-scale patterns and the drivers of leaf and ecosystem WUEs and quantify the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors. Using published world-wide delta C-13 (carbon stable isotope composition) measurements for 6751 C-3 plant populations from 174 publications, as well as our own measurements of delta C-13 for 418 C-3 plant populations across drylands in China, and satellite-based datasets of gross primary production and evapotranspiration, we determined global patterns and the drivers of leaf and ecosystem WUEs. Leaf intrinsic WUE (iWUE) and ecosystem WUE displayed almost opposite trends, in response to abiotic factors on a global scale. iWUE was highest in arid regions and lowest in humid regions, whereas ecosystem WUE was lowest in arid regions and highest in humid regions. Phylogeny had a significant effect on iWUE. Mean annual temperature (MAT) was the strongest factor in predicting iWUE, whereas the most robust factor in predicting ecosystem WUE was leaf area index (LAI). The data indicate that the two different responses at the leaf and ecosystem levels must be considered when modeling carbon and water balances in response to climate change.

However, information about the inoculation of beneficial microbes on halophytes in arid and semi-arid regions remains inadequate. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of AMF (Glomus mosseae) inoculation, alone or in combination with PGPR (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens), on biomass accumulation, morphological characteristics, photosynthetic capacity, and rhizospheric soil enzyme activities of Elaeagnus angustifolia L., a typical halophyte in the northwest of China. The results indicate that, for one-year-old seedlings of Elaeagnus angustifolia L., AMF significantly promoted biomass accumulation in aboveground organs, increased the numbers of leaves and branches, and improved the leaf areas, stem diameters and plant height. AMF-mediated morphological characteristics of aboveground organs favored light interception and absorption and maximized the capacities for photosynthesis, transpiration, carbon dioxide assimilation and gas exchange of Elaeagnus angustifolia L. seedlings in saline soil. AMF also promoted root growth, modified root architecture, and enhanced soil enzyme activities. Elaeagnus angustifolia L. was more responsive to specific inoculation by AMF than by a combination of AMF and PGPR or by solely PGPR in saline soils. Therefore, we suggest that G. mosseae can be used in saline soil to enhance Elaeagnus angustifolia L. seedlings growth and improve soil nutrient uptake. This represents a biological technique to aid in restoration of saline-degraded areas.					xue, xue/JTV-1627-2023; zhang, wenjuan/A-9413-2011	zhang, wenjuan/0000-0002-9704-766X														2076-3417				FEB	2020	10	3							945	10.3390/app10030945	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10030945													WOS:000525305900216

Contribution of Proximal and Distal Grains Within Spikelets in Relation to Yield and Yield Components in the Winter Wheat Production Region of China From 1948 to 2012	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Grain number and weight within a spikelet are major yield components which determine the grain yield in wheat. The objective of this study was to explore genetic gains in grain performance within wheat spikelets at the individual grain level and its effect on grain yield and evaluate genetic progress in stem internode length and other yield-related traits. We conducted field experiments across three growing seasons in the western Yellow and Huai Valley of China; incorporating 17 bread wheat cultivars released from 1948 to 2012. Yields were significantly correlated with year of release. Yield gains equated to 3.95 g m(-2) yr(-1) in response to increases in total grain weight per m(2) (GW) in proximal (G1 and G2) and distal (G3 and G4) grains, despite a decline in the proportional contribution of proximal grains to yield and increase in the proportional contribution of distal grains to yield with year of release. Grain number per m(2) (GN), thousand-grain weight (TGW), and harvest index (HI) increased with year of release, but plant height decreased. Both grain number per spikelet of proximal and distal grain contributed to the increase in total GN. However, the contribution ratio of GN in proximal grains to total GN declined, and the proportion in distal grains increased. Average single grain weight (SGW) increased linearly at G1, G2, G3, and G4 with year of release and contributed to the increase in TGW. The G3 and G4 grain positions had much lower individual grain weights but increased at a faster rate than G1 and G2. At G1, G2, and G3 grain positions, from bottom to top spikelets, the newly released cultivars had the heaviest grains and the old cultivars had the lightest grains. New cultivars had more spikelets than old cultivars and the number of grains (proximal and distal grains) in the apical spike increased with year of release. The length of five internodes decreased significantly with year of release, more so in the upper than lower internodes, all of which contributed to the decline in plant height. In summary, increasing the number and weight of distal grains could increase grain yield, TGW, and GN.

Geo-accumulation index, Ecological potential risk index, Pollution load index, and Consensus-based sediment quality guidelines were employed to evaluate the ecological risk associated with heavy metals in sediments. Macroinvertebrate community structure was analyzed, following which the quality surrounding habitat was evaluated basing on the indexes. Our results confirmed that the orders of pollution level were 10-20 cm > 0-10 cm at different layers and Cd > Ni > Pb > Cu > Cr > Zn for different metals. Through correlation analysis and redundancy analysis, macroinvertebrate metrics exhibited significant correlations with heavy metals. Gastropods and R (Ratio of Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera index to Chironomidae) were selected as bioindicators in overall qualitative analysis. In the 0-10 cm layer, Gastropods and Family biotic index could be selected as bioindicators. Whereas, in the 10-20 cm layer, suitable bioindicators were Oligochaetes and D-M (Maralef richness index). Heavy metals, especially Cd, in sediments may pose adverse impact on macroinvertebrate community.					wang, xinxin/HIR-2598-2022; Song, Jinxi/AAF-6060-2020	Song, Jinxi/0000-0001-9838-8063; Wang, Xinxin/0000-0001-8013-3660													2210-6707	2210-6715				OCT	2019	50								101665	10.1016/j.scs.2019.101665	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101665													WOS:000484255800044

Channel bank erosion quantification is prerequisite to couple effectively the bank sediment supply system with fluvial sediment transport fluxes. The objectives of this study were to describe and evaluate methods for monitoring and data post-analysis of channel widening in the presence of a non-erodible layer. Technology was developed to capture 5-cm spaced cross-sections along a soil flume at 3-s time intervals. Two off-the-shelf digital cameras were positioned 3-m above the soil bed and controlled by a program to trigger simultaneously and download images to the computer. Methods utilizing color differences in images and elevation differences in DEMs were applied to detect discontinuities between channel walls and the soil bed. Channel widths were calculated by differentiating the coordinates of these surface discontinuities. A volumetric method was used to calculate flow velocity with measurements of flow depths obtained from ultrasonic depth sensors. Sediment concentration was determined by manual sampling. The results showed that different channel width calculation methods exhibited comparable outcomes and achieved satisfactory accuracy. Sediment discharge showed a significant positive linear correlation with channel widening rate, while exhibiting a 5 to 25-s time lag compared to the peak of channel widening rate. Total sediment discharge calculated by photogrammetry was 3.1% lower than that calculated by manual sampling. Flow velocity decreased with time and showed a significant negative power correlation with channel width. Advantages of the described methodology include automated high spatial and temporal monitoring resolution, semi-automated data post-processing, and the potential to be generalized to large scale river/reservoir bank failure monitoring.

Recent empirical and theoretical studies have shown that ecosystem functioning is strongly affected by the community-weighted mean (CWM) traits and functional traits diversity (FTD). However, little is known about the relative roles of CWM traits and FTD in explaining ecosystem functioning along a grassland restoration gradient on the Loess Plateau of China. We set up a grassland restoration gradient on the Loess Plateau of China applying the chronosequence approach. Using community biomass and soil carbon stock (SCS) as proxies for ecosystem functioning, we measured 13 functional traits on 28 common plant species and identified the dominant functional traits through principal component analysis (PCA). Our results showed that: (1) Specific leaf area (SLA), mature plant height (MPH) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) loaded on separate principle components, which could be regarded as dominant functional traits to assess ecosystem functioning. (2) The variation of species diversity was not obvious, but FTD changed significantly along the restoration gradient. Following initial increases, FTD, CWM-SLA and SCS then declined, with the threshold occurring at the 18-year restoration. (3) Community biomass increased significantly through more biomass allocation to the below-ground in the latter stage of restoration. Community biomass was significantly correlated with CWM-MPH while SCS was positively correlated with CWM-SLA. We conclude that community-level functional traits are better than species diversity and FTD in predicting ecosystem functioning, and specifically restoration for 18 years could be the turning point for the degraded grassland ecosystem on the Loess Plateau of China.

GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												Phosphorus (P) is a key nutrient required by plants for their growth and development. A large part of applied phosphatic fertilizer becomes unavailable due to its fixation in soil. In rhizosphere, fluorescent Pseudomonads are instrumental in phosphate solubilization. We isolated Pseudomonads from the rhizosphere of Aloe barbadensis (L.), and screened them for their plant growth promoting ability such as - solubilization of phosphate, auxin production and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity. A total of 307 fluorescent Pseudomonas were isolated and screened, of which, 24 isolates showed a strong phosphate solubilizing ability, ranging from 69.71 to 236.73 mu g ml(-1) . The Indole acetic acid (IAA) production by all 24 isolates varied from 28.44 to 151.99 mu g ml(-1). However, 17 isolates produced ACC-deaminase ranging from 8.19 to 10.27 mu mol mg(-1) h(-1). Analyses of 16S rRNA gene and Pseudomonas-specific genes grouped the isolates in seven different species of fluorescent Pseudomonas. Genotypic analysis based on 16S rDNA-RFLP using restriction enzymes (HaeIII, AluI and MspI) and BOX-PCR generated unique genotype specific pattern. The results suggested that Pseudomonas diversity has no association with microenvironments and the sampling site of the plants. 16S rRNA gene-based diversity indices revealed great diversity among the fluorescent Pseudomonas recovered from the rhizospheric regions of the Aloe. Due to the above plant growth-promoting traits, fluorescent Pseudomonas can be exploited as bio-inoculants for crops, with minimal damage to the environment.

J	Pei, YW; Huang, LM; Li, DF; Shao, MA				Pei, Yanwu; Huang, Laiming; Li, Danfeng; Shao, Mingan			Characteristics and controls of solute transport under different conditions of soil texture and vegetation type in the waterewind erosion crisscross region of China's Loess Plateau	CHEMOSPHERE												The analysis of solute transport characteristics in soil is of great significance in understanding nutrient cycling and pollutant migration in the Earth's Critical Zone. The objective of this study was to investigate the transport characteristics and the influencing factors of Cl- in soils with different textures (sandy-S and loamy-L), and covered by different vegetation types (arbor-AR, shrub-SH and grass-GR) in the water ewind erosion crisscross region of the northern Loess Plateau of China. Results showed that the initial penetration time (TS: 12-80 min), entire penetration time (TE: 75-480 min), average flow velocity in the pore (V: 0.52-1.98 cm h(-1)) and the hydrodynamic diffusion coefficient (D: 0.75-2.55 cm(2) h(-1)) of Cl- varied with different soil textures and vegetation types, and at different soil depths. The V and D associated with Cl- transport were highest in the 0e20 cm soil layer and decreased with increasing depth, while the opposite trend was observed for TS and TE. For the 0-1 m soil profile of the same texture but covered by different vegetation types, the average V and D followed the order of S-AR > S-GR > S- SH and L-AR > L-SH > L-GR, while the average TS and TE exhibited the exact opposite order. This behavior is caused by the varying distributions of root biomass under different vegetation types that affect the number of macropores, the connectivity density and the preferential flow paths in the soil. For the 0-1m soil profiles of different textures covered by the same vegetation type, the average V and D followed the order of S-AR > L-AR; S-SH > L-SH; and S-GR > L-GR, while the average TS and TE showed the opposite trend. This is because the pore size and distribution in soil are significantly affected by soil mechanical composition. There are significant correlations between soil properties (e.g., bulk density, number of macropores, pore connectivity density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil organic carbon content and particle composition) and the transport parameters (e.g., V, TS, and TE). The pedotransfer functions using readily available soil properties can adequately predict V of Cl- transport under different conditions of soil texture and vegetation type. These results provide guidance for the rational configuration of artificial vegetation in different textural soils with respect to reduce nutrient loss and improve ecosystem functions in the northern Loess Plateau of China.

J	Ye, LP; Tan, WF; Fang, LC; Ji, LL				Ye, Luping; Tan, Wenfeng; Fang, Linchuan; Ji, Lingling			Spatial analysis of soil aggregate stability in a small catchment of the Loess Plateau, China: II. Spatial prediction	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												As indicators of soil degradation vulnerability, soil aggregate stability indices play important roles in representing soil resistance to water erosion, and their spatial variability provides both agriculturally and environmentally important information. The spatial variability of aggregate stability indices is synergistically affected by the soil, topography, vegetation, and human factors. To understand the formation processes of aggregates by a spatial analysis, a prediction model combining soil properties with natural and human factors should be developed to improve the accuracy of the spatial interpolation of soil aggregate stability indices. In this study, the mean weight-diameter (MWD, mm), water-stable aggregates greater than 0.25 mm (WSA (> 0.25), %) and soil erodibility factor (K factor) were satisfactorily predicted by multiple stepwise regression (MSR) and regression kriging (RK) based on soil properties and natural and human factors (0.436 <= R-2 <= 0.578). In addition, spatial variability and prediction modeling of aggregate stability indices were highly dependent on the quantification of land use type and landscape structure (the spatial structure of landscape elements and the connections between the different ecosystem types or landscape elements). It has received little attention in previous studies. The exclusion of all soil variables did not affect the predictions of K factor, and for MWD and WSA (> 0.25.) even though the performance of the models may appear relatively low, but also significant (0.183 <= R-2 <= 0.312), indicating that the prediction of the spatial distributions of aggregate stability indices with easily available auxiliary data is practicable and effective. Residual maps showed that high residuals are distributed around built-up land (transportation land and residential land) or farmland, indicating that anthropogenic factors increase the uncertainty of the models. The spatial distribution maps of MWD, WSA (> 0.25) and K factor can be useful in landscape planning and decision making to minimize water erosion risks.

However, the influence of warming and nitrogen (N) addition and their combined effects on soil microbial community composition and structure are still not well understood. To explore the effect of warming and N addition on the composition and structure of soil microbial communities, a five-year field experiment was conducted in a temperate meadow. We examined the responses of soil fungal and bacterial community compositions and structures to warming and N addition using ITS gene and 16S rRNA gene MiSeq sequencing methods, respectively. Warming and N addition not only increased the diversity of soil fungal species but also affected the soil fungal community structure. Warming and N addition caused significant declines in soil bacterial richness but had few impacts on bacterial community structure. The changes in plant species richness affected the soil fungal community structure, while the changes in plant cover also affected the bacterial community structure. The response of the soil bacterial community structure to warming and N addition was lower than that of the fungal community structure. Our results highlight that the influence of global changes on soil fungal and bacterial community structures might be different, and which also might be determined, to some extent, by plant community, soil physicochemical properties, and climate characteristics at the regional scale.

We conducted a two-year field experiment in the Loess Plateau region of China to explore the effects of different planting patterns (flat planting without film mulching; ridge-furrow plastic film mulching planting with three ridge-furrow ratios of 40:70 cm, 55:55 cm, and 70:40 cm) and nitrogen application rates (180 kg ha(-1), 240 kg ha(-1), and 300 kg ha(-1)) on the growth and activity of roots, root-shoot relationship, and grain yield and WUE of rain-fed spring maize. The planting pattern and nitrogen application rate only affected the root characteristic parameters in the shallow soil layer (0-40 m), where these parameters all increased as the ridge-furrow ratio and nitrogen application rate increased. The improvements in the root characteristic parameters were beneficial for increasing the root bleeding sap rate. The root-shoot ratio was only affected by the planting pattern. Compared with flat planting, increasing the ridge-furrow ratio enhanced the root-shoot ratio in the early growth stage, which was beneficial for allowing roots to acquire soil resources and promoting canopy establishment; however, the opposite results were observed in the late growth stage, thereby suggesting that increasing the ridge-furrow ratio promoted the distribution of dry matter to the shoots and reduced redundant root growth. The spring maize grain yield and water use efficiency were significantly positively correlated with the root characteristic parameters and the root bleeding sap rate but negatively correlated with the root-shoot ratio, thereby explaining the increases in the grain yield and water use efficiency as the ridge-furrow ratio and nitrogen application rate increased. However, there were generally no significant differences in the grain yield and water use efficiency between 240 kg ha(-1) and 300 kg ha(-1) under the same planting pattern. Therefore, the combination of ridge furrow plastic film mulching planting with three ridge-furrow ratios of 70:40 cm and 240 kg ha(-1) may be applied as a suitable field management practice for rain-fed spring maize production in the Loess Plateau region.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				JUN	2022	220								105385	10.1016/j.still.2022.105385	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2022.105385		MAR 2022											WOS:000793189200002

In addition, local factors act as filters on regional species-pools to shape the assemblage composition of local caves. Surveys of 35 Levantine caves, distributed along a climate gradient from the mesic in the north of Israel to hyper-arid areas in the south of Israel, were conducted to test the effect of cave characteristics, location, climate, bat presence, and guano level on the spider assemblage. We found 62 spider species and assigned four species as troglobites, 28 as troglophiles, and 30 as accidentals. Precipitation, elevation, latitude, minimum temperature, and guano levels significantly affected the composition of cave-dwelling spider assemblages. Caves situated in the Mediterranean region had higher species richness and abundance, as well as more troglobite and troglophile arachnids. These discoveries contribute to the knowledge of the local arachnofauna and are important for the conservation of cave ecosystems. By comparing spider assemblages of Levantine caves to European caves, we identified gaps in the taxonomic research, focusing our efforts on spider families that may have additional cryptic or yet to be described cave-dwelling spider species. Our faunistic surveys are crucial stages for understanding the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms of arachnid speciation in Levantine caves.

Recent Findings New constraints of fire effects on the carbon cycle and climate are provided by the quantification of the carbon ages and effects of vegetation types and traits. For global scale modelling, the low understanding of the human-fire relationship is limiting. Summary Recent developments allow improvements in Earth system models with respect to the influences of vegetation on climate, peatland burning and the pyrogenic carbon cycle. Better understanding of human influences is required.

Developing suitable management practices is critical to mitigating the ill effects of rainfall variability and low phosphorous availability. Applying biochar, a soil conditioner produced from various bio-waste has been suggested to improve soil moisture content and carbon level. Similarly applying phosphobacteria, a bio-inoculant can enhance P availability to black gram crops. However, the interaction between biochar and phosphobacteria application in low pH Alfisol under rainfed conditions is not fully explored. To fill this knowledge gap, field experiments were conducted to assess the effect of biochar and Bacillus megaterium var phosphaticum (Pb-1) on the availability of phosphorous, black gram growth, and yield. The factors tested were redgram stalk biochar and Australian acacia biochar, enriched farmyard manure, phosphobacteria, and phosphorus fertilizer and their various combinations. Biochar application at 5 t ha(-1) increased soil moisture retention and reduced the penetration resistance. The addition of biochar with phosphobacteria positively enhanced the plant physiological parameters such as leaf area, stomatal conductance, SPAD, and reduced the leaf temperature. Application of redgram stalk biochar at 5 t ha(-1) with phosphobacteria 2 kg ha 1 recorded higher organic carbon (4.7 g kg(-1)), soil available P (30.9 kg ha(-1)) and P uptake (4.6 kg ha(-1)), by 27, 28 and 45 percent respectively over P fertilizer alone applied treatment. The same treatment combination also recorded the highest seed yield (262 kg ha(-1)) implying the combined application of biochar and phosphobacteria has the potential to enhance black gram production in rain-fed low pH Alfisols.					c, swaminathan/V-2838-2019; Bose, Jayakumar/C-2429-2014	c, swaminathan/0000-0003-1206-1452; Bose, Jayakumar/0000-0002-0565-2951													0167-8809	1873-2305				MAR 1	2021	308								107258	10.1016/j.agee.2020.107258	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.107258													WOS:000604619300002

Alfalfa production in this region is limited during the hot-rainy summer period from July-September, but these conditions may allow the production of intercropped silage maize (Zea mays L.) following spring harvests of alfalfa to boost the overall forage production. In this study, an alfalfa-silage maize (AM) relay intercropping system was evaluated in a field experiment from 2017 to 2019 to assess the impact of maize nitrogen (N) fertilization rates of 0, 60, 120, and 180 kg N ha(-1) and maize plant densities of 30,000, 45,000, and 60,000 plants ha(-1) on the forage yield and N uptake. The AM system was compared with alfalfa monocropping (AA) and silage maize monocropping (MM) controls. The 3-yr average land equivalent ratio (LER) and land equivalent ratio for nitrogen yield (LERN) of AM ranged from 1.05 to 1.37 relative to AA and MM, indicating that intercropping was advantageous for improving the overall forage production and N utilization. Intercropping reduced the maize yield by 23-30 % and the maize N yield by 26-35 % compared with the monocultured maize across 3 years. Increasing N fertilization and maize plant density often enhanced the maize yield and N uptake in the AM system. The alfalfa stand density in AM was negatively affected by the increased maize plant density and was 30-55 % lower than that in AA. Spring forage production of alfalfa in the AM and AA systems was similar in most cases, but yields in the AM system were reduced in 2018 and 2019 when maize was grown with the highest N rate (180 kg N ha(-1)) and the highest plant density (60,000 plants ha(-1)). On the basis of the system yield, N yield, and LER, the AM system with a maize plant density of 45,000 plants ha-1 fertilized at 120 kg N ha(-1) was the most advantageous and could be recommended as an alternative cropping system in the NCP to increase forage yields with a relatively low input of N.					zhang, ying/HJB-1230-2022; Zhang, Y J/HLG-1022-2023; lei, ma/AAX-1038-2020; z, y/HPC-0477-2023	lei, ma/0000-0003-4268-0596; Xu, Ruixuan/0000-0002-3787-4559													0378-4290	1872-6852				APR 1	2021	263								108068	10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2021.108068		JAN 2021											WOS:000649737900005

However, the fundamental role and mechanisms by which terrace construction affects in situ soil CO2 emissions and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) remain poorly understood. In this study, topsoil removal-addition approach was used to simulate topsoil redistribution during terrace construction. Compared with the nearby undisturbed soil, the average annual soil CO2 emission over two years was reduced by 24% in the topsoil removed field but enhanced by 33% in the topsoil added field. The decreased soil CO2 emission at the topsoil removed field was largely associated with the depletion of SOC stocks and microbial biomass carbon, while the increments of SOC available for decomposition at the topsoil added field contributed to its increased soil CO2 emissions. However, the average Q(10) value in the topsoil removed field was 23% greater at seasonal scale and 28% greater at diurnal scale than that in the undisturbed soil. The increased Q(10) in the topsoil removed field is mainly due to higher aromaticity of water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and the domination of Actinobacteria in keystone taxa. Overall, our results show that changes in both aromaticity of WEOC and soil microbial community composition induced by soil redistribution during terrace construction may alter the response of soil CO2 emission to elevated temperature. Our study indicates that the impact of man-made soil redistribution should not be neglected when studying regional carbon cycling. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, a realistic representation of the role played by vegetation cover when modelling the rainfall-runoff system is essential for predicting water, sediment, and nutrient transport on hillslopes. Here, we developed a new mathematical model to describe the dynamics of interception, infiltration, and overland flow on canopy-covered sloping land. Based on the relationship between rainfall intensity and the maximum interception rate, the interception process was modelled under two simplified scenarios (i.e., r(e) <= Int(m) and r(e) > Int(m)). Parameterization of the model was based on consideration of both vegetation condition and soil properties. By analysing the given examples, we found that Int(m) reflects the capacity of the canopy to store the precipitation, k reveals the ability of the canopy to retain the intercepted water, and the processes of infiltration and runoff generation are impacted dramatically by Int(m) and k. To evaluate the model, simulated rainfall experiments were conducted in 2 years (2016 and 2017) across six cultivation plots at Changwu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The parameters were obtained by fitting the unit discharge (simulated rainfall experiments in 2016) using the least squares method, and estimation formulas for parameters pertaining to vegetation/soil factors (measured in 2016) were constructed via multiple nonlinear regressions. By matching the simulated results and unit discharge (simulated rainfall experiments in 2017), the validity of the model was verified, and a reasonable precision (average R-2 = .86 and average root mean square error = 6.45) was obtained. The model developed in this research creatively incorporates the canopy interception process to complement the modelling of rainfall infiltration and runoff generation during vegetation growth and offers an improved hydrological basis to analyse matter transport during rainfall events.

We used the Ion S5TM XL sequencing platform to explore the distributions of microbial communities in the rhizosphere , bulk soil of Robinia pseudoacacia at 11 mature forest sites along a north-south precipitation gradient in the Loess Plateau, China. Microbial alpha-diversity mostly peaked in the south zone at lower latitudes , significant distance -decay patterns were observed in both bacterial and fungal communities. Fungal communities exhibited more distinct spatial patterns in the rhizosphere than bacterial communities. The relative influence of geographic factors on bacterial/fungal community turnover in the rhizosphere (12.4/16.7%) and bulk soil (16.1/17.1%) was greater than that of local environmental factors. Microbial community assembly was mainly governed by deterministic processes (98% of nearest taxon index > 2), despite their relative importance decreasing from bulk soil to the rhizosphere in the case of bacteria. Co-occurrence patterns of sensitive taxa were more complex in the bacterial network than in the fungal network owing to a marked regional effect. Interactions of bacterial taxa differentially enriched between soil compartments were much closer than fungal interactions, indicating a stronger rhizosphere effect on bacteria. The results provide novel insights into the assembly of rhizosphere microbial communities in large-scale forest ecosystems under vegetation restoration.					liu, xiao/JLL-2119-2023; wu, p/JDW-5015-2023; zhang, yan/JGL-8022-2023; wu, jialin/JPY-4408-2023; LI, YUN/JTV-7108-2023; Yang, Jing/JFK-4046-2023; li, rui/JVM-8999-2024; Chen, Feng/JQW-8742-2023; chen, Chen/JKJ-2122-2023; zhang, chen/JES-0371-2023; li, wenjing/JMP-7498-2023; Lin, Lin/JTU-1595-2023; wang, xi/JNT-5162-2023; Zhou, heng/JCN-6493-2023; yang, peng/JEZ-8452-2023; lei, lei/JSL-3106-2023; Yang, Fan/JMA-9594-2023; wang, KiKi/JFZ-3334-2023; Liu, Zhihao/JUF-7651-2023; WANG, YING/JLM-9219-2023; Zhang, Bo/JVD-9890-2024; Li, Lei/JPE-6543-2023; Liu, Jie/JCP-1070-2023; Zhang, Yun/JCN-7026-2023; Yuan, Fang/JQV-7426-2023; li, Li/JPA-0218-2023; Li, Yao/JJC-2927-2023; Li, Wei/JLL-4365-2023; Chen, Wenqing/JFS-1203-2023; zhang, hao/JOJ-7093-2023; LI, SHA/JNR-9956-2023; wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023; zhang, xinyu/JKI-8403-2023; chen, xu/JNT-3068-2023; zhou, yang/JED-3951-2023; liu, yang/JMB-9083-2023; Zhang, Zixuan/JSL-3603-2023; zheng, yan/JKJ-3632-2023; yang, li/JGM-1009-2023; xu, chen/JNE-5010-2023; li, xiang/JCN-9316-2023; Liu, Shao/JFK-0166-2023; yang, xiao/JTQ-0214-2023; Wang, He/JCO-3900-2023; wang, wang/JQW-3034-2023; chen, gang/JRX-1197-2023; Chen, Yu/JLL-0171-2023; wang, jiaqi/JSL-7112-2023; Yang, Jie/JDM-6213-2023; yuan, lin/JDW-7387-2023; Zhang, Wei/JKI-3565-2023; Jing, Jing/JSK-6237-2023; Zhang, Shiwei/JIY-4344-2023	Yang, Jing/0009-0004-8274-9863; Yang, Jie/0000-0002-3941-0053; zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310; Chen, Wenqing/0000-0003-2136-2695													0016-7061	1872-6259				JUL	2023	435								116516	10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116516		MAY 2023											WOS:001002467400001

Here we find that global steeply sloped cropland supports similar to 168 million people's livelihoods. Large disparities in population pressure on steeply sloped cropland exist across the development spectrum, among which lower-middle-income countries have the highest population density (similar to 222 per km(2)) and low-income countries have the largest population growth rate (similar to 62.1% from 2000 to 2020). Moreover, inhabitants of steeply sloped cropland, especially those belonging to low-income countries, are marginalized from public services and face more environmental pressure represented by severe soil erosion and low cropland productivity. Our findings imply that residents of steeply sloped cropland deserve more attention to eradicate global poverty and inequality.

However, yield estimates in Ethiopia are based on time-consuming surveys. We used Sentinel-2, spectroradiometeric, and ground-truthing data to estimate the grain yield (GY) of two major crops, teff, and finger millet, in Ethiopia's Aba Gerima catchment in 2020 and 2021. At the flowering stage, we performed supervised classification on October Sentinel-2 images and spectral reflectance measurement. We used regression models to identify and predict crop yields, as evaluated by the coefficient of determination (adjusted R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) provided the best fit to the data among the vegetation indices used to predict teff and finger millet GY. Soil bund construction increased the majority of vegetation indices and GY of both crops. We discovered a strong correlation between GY and the satellite EVI and NDVI. However, NDVI and EVI had the greatest influence on teff GY (adjusted R2 = 0.83; RMSE = 0.14 ton/ha), while NDVI had the greatest influence on finger millet GY (adjusted R2 = 0.85; RMSE = 0.24 ton/ha). Teff GY ranged from 0.64 to 2.16 ton/ha for bunded plots and 0.60 to 1.85 ton/ha for non-bunded plots using Sentinel-2 data. Besides, finger millet GY ranged from 1.92 to 2.57 ton/ha for bunded plots and 1.81 to 2.38 ton/ha for non-bunded plots using spec-troradiometric data. Our findings show that Sentinel -2-and spectroradiometeric-based moni-toring can help farmers manage teff and finger millet to achieve higher yields, more sustainable food production, and better environmental quality in the area. The study's findings revealed a link between VIs and soil management practices in soil ecological systems. Model extrapolation to other areas will necessitate local validation.

The results show that among the response relationships between each hydraulic parameter and T-c, the relationships between flow power, unit flow power, and average flow velocity and T-c is significant. In predicting T-c under different soil conditions, the shear stress produced divergence, which should be further explored. The reliability of using slope and flow rate as a single parameter to predict T(c )is questionable. As a kinetic index, flow power can be used to predict T-c. The average flow velocity and unit flow power can predict T-c well and are closely related to the soil used in the experiments. The shear stress of water flow can express the evolution of T-c, which is mainly influenced by the median particle size of sediment particles in predicting T-c. The results of the study provide a new method for establishing a prediction model for soil erosion in the loess hilly gully area.																			2709-8028	2709-8036				2023 JAN 24	2023										10.2166/aqua.2022.054	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/aqua.2022.054		JAN 2023											WOS:000922012600001

Saline water irrigation can maintain crop yield inmost world regions of freshwater shortage. However, saline water irrigation may also induce soil salt accumulation, which would result in the change of soil physical or chemical properties. Saline water irrigation's effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) contents is of little concern. In this study, we irrigated soil with 1 g L (-1), 4 g L-1 and 8 g L (-1) saline water in a winter-wheat and summer-maize rotation system. After 14 years of irrigation, we sampled soils in a winter wheat and summer maize rotation system, and analyzed soil water, soil salt, SOC, and SIC contents. The results showed that, compared with 1 g L (-1) water irrigation, 8 g L-1 saline water irrigation significantly increased soil water and salt contents. Moreover, 8 g L (-1) saline water irrigation significantly decreased SOC and SIC contents in the 0-20 cm soil layer (p < 0.05) and mainly decreased SOC content in > 1 mm aggregates and wheat-derived SOC content in bulk soil. In comparison, 4 g L (-1) saline water had no significant effect on soil water, soil salt, SOC, and SIC contents. These results indicated that a high concentration of saline water irrigation is harmful for soil carbon sequestration, while a low concentration of saline water did not affect soil carbon sequestration. Thus, using no more than 4 g L (-1) saline water irrigation for 14 years can maintain soil carbon storage in the water shortage areas.

Antimicrobial peptides producing native<i> Bacillus</i> spp. for the management of root-knot nematode<i> Meloidogyne</i><i> incognita</i> infecting okra<i> (Abelmoschus</i><i> esculentus</i> L. Moench)	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												In the present study, native strains of Bacillus species were isolated, characterized and evaluated for their biocontrol efficacy in laboratory, pot and field conditions to combat Meloidogyne incognita incidence in okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L. Moench). Based on the laboratory results, two Bacillus spp., Bacillus marisflavi CRB2 and Bacillus subtilis CRB7 were found most effective against M. incognita. We also profiled antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes associated with this two Bacillus spp. Bacillus marisflavi CRB2 was found to harbour 10 AMP genes whereas, B. subtilis CRB7 had 8 AMP genes with the expression of 3 and 4 genes, respectively at the RNA level. Talc based formulation of B. marisflavi CRB2 and B. subtilis CRB7 were evaluated under pot and field conditions for the management of M. incognita in okra. Bacillus marisflavi CRB2 and B. subtilis CRB7 at dose of 5 g plant- 1 were found most effective against M. incognita by reducing the nematode incidence in okra under pot conditions. Further, field application of either Bacillus marisflavi CRB2 and B. subtilis CRB7 as a combination of seed treatment 20 g kg- 1 seed + soil application (5 kg ha- 1) of enriched vermicompost (2 t ha- 1) + soil drenching @ 1% at 30 days interval showed a significant reduction of M. incognita incidence in okra and also increased yield as compared to untreated control. Their bioefficacy was comparable with carbofuran 3G (1 kg a.i. ha- 1) treatments. Thus, the native strains B. marisflavi CRB2 and B. subtilis CRB7 having diverse antimicrobial peptide genes can be used as one of the components in the integrated nematode management strategy to combat M. incognita incidence in okra.

In this study, we developed multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) models considering different combinations of the meteorological data for predicting the ET0 in the Beas-Sutlej basin of Himachal Pradesh (India). Four climatic locations in the basin namely, Kullu, Mandi, Bilaspur, and Chaba were selected. The meteorological dataset comprised air temperature (maximum, minimum and mean), relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed, recorded daily for a period of 35 years (1984-2019). The datasets from 1984 to 2012 and 2013 to 2019 were utilized for training and testing the models, respectively. The performance of the developed models was evaluated using several statistical indices. For each location, the best performed MLP-ANN model was the one with the complete combination of the meteorological data. The architecture of the best performing model for Kullu, Mandi, Bilaspur, and Chaba was (6-2-4-1), (6-5-4-1), (6-5-4-1), and (6-4-6-1), respectively. It was observed, however, that the performance of other models was also relatively good, given the limited meteorological data utilized in those models. Further, to appreciate the relative predictive ability of the developed models, a comparison was performed with four existing established empirical models. The approach adopted in this study can be effectively utilized by water users and field researchers for modelling and predicting ET0 in data-scarce locations.					Islam, Abu Reza Md.

JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Melatonin, a regulatory molecule, performs pleiotropic functions in plants, including aluminum (Al) stress mitigation. Here, we conducted transcriptomic and physiological analyses to identify metabolic processes associated with the alleviated Al-induced growth inhibition of the melatonin-treated (MT) maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings. Melatonin decreased Al concentration in maize roots and leaves under Al stress. Al stress reduced the total dry weight (DW) by 41.2% after 7 days of treatment. By contrast, the total DW was decreased by only 19.4% in MT plants. According to RNA-Seq, enzyme activity, and metabolite content data, MT plants exhibited a higher level of relatively stable carbon and nitrogen metabolism than non-treated (NT) plants. Under Al stress, MT plants showed higher photosynthetic rate and sucrose content by 29.9% and 20.5% than NT plants, respectively. Similarly, the nitrate reductase activity and protein content of MT plants were 34.0% and 15.0% higher than those of NT plants, respectively. Furthermore, exogenous supply of melatonin mitigated Al-induced oxidative stress. Overall, our results suggest that melatonin alleviates aluminum-induced growth inhibition through modulating carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and reestablishing redox homeostasis in maize.

In order to explore whether and why abnormal correlation exits in its five sub-basins, the temporal changes between AED and AE were compared, and then the impacts of climate change and human activities on abnormal correlations were assessed using the sensitivity method of Penman equation and the decomposition method of Budyko equation. The results indicated: (1) Pan evaporation and potential evaporation (indicators of AED) decreased at rates of up to -0.04 and -0.06 mm d(-1) decade(-1), respectively. In contrast, the water budget-derived evaporation (an indicator of AE) increased at the rate of 0.09 mm d(-1) decade(-1) in the Fuhe River basin and remained stable in other basins. Abnormal correlations (nonpositive correlations) were observed. (2) Decreasing net radiation and wind speed were major climate factors resulting in simultaneous temporal decreases in AED and AE. In contrast, afforestation was a major human factor leading to an increase in annual AE of 78 mm, but had no effect on AED. Afforestation was the primary driving force of the abnormal correlation. These results could provide water-energy guidance for urban climate change mitigation and flood/drought disaster management.

This study explores the efficacy of coal-based solid waste soil conditioner and vermicompost as mixedcomponent soil amendments in varying proportions. Through comprehensive field experiments, we investigate the impact of these amendments on soil physicochemical properties, microbial diversity, and the growth of L. chinensis, a grass species native to saline areas. Our findings reveal that the application of vermicompost-based soil amendments effectively reduced soil conductivity and led to noteworthy improvements in the pH of Saline-Alkali soil. Moreover, these amendments demonstrated a marked capacity to enhance soil organic matter and available nutrients, most notably available phosphorus. Concurrently, the introduced soil amendments exhibited a positive influence on soil microbial diversity. A correlation analysis underscores the pivotal roles of soil pH and organic matter in shifting soil microbial communities. In response to amendments, L. chinensis exhibited varying degrees of growth enhancement, with biomass increments ranging from 6.37% to 19.91%. In summary, vermicompost and soil conditioner can improve Saline-Alkali land by supplementing organic matter and effective nutrients, improving pH and conductivity, and regulating microbial community, so as to realize the restoration and improvement of Saline-Alkali land; the greatest improvement was achieved with soil conditioner and vermicompost application rates of 30,000 kg. ha (-1) and 15,000 kg.ha (-1), respectively. Our results provide robust support for advocating for the integration of vermicompostbased soil amendments in Saline-Alkali land management strategies.																				2073-4441				SEP	2023	15	17							3075	10.3390/w15173075	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15173075													WOS:001065310800001

South Africa is recognized for its animal diversity, yet little is published about the parasite diversity associated with wild rodent species. By focusing on a wildlife-human/domestic animal interface, the study aims to record ectoparasite diversity and levels of infestations of the Bushveld gerbil, Gerbilliscus leucogaster, and to establish the relationship between ectoparasite infestation parameters and host-and habitat factors. Rodents (n = 127) were trapped in 2 habitat types (natural and agricultural) during 2014-2020. More than 6500 individuals of 32 epifaunistic species represented by 21 genera and belonging to 5 taxonomic groups (fleas, sucking lice, ticks, mesostigmatan mites and trombiculid mites) were collected. Mesostigmatan mites and lice were the most abundant and fleas and mesostigmatan mites the most prevalent groups. Flea and mesostigmatan mite numbers and mesostigmatan mite species richness was significantly higher on reproductively active male than female rodents. Only ticks were significantly associated with habitat type, with significantly higher tick numbers and more tick species on rodents in the natural compared to the agricultural habitat. We conclude that the level of infestation by ectoparasites closely associated with the host (fleas and mites) was affected by host-associated factors, while infestation by ectoparasite that spend most of their life in the external environment (ticks) was affected by habitat type.

Herein, based on a long-term experiment in the red soil hilly region in China, we investigated the effects of 17 years of SWCMs on soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen (MBC and MBN, respectively) as well as soil erodibility (K factor) at soil depths of 0-100 cm in the top, middle and bottom parts of the slope. The SWCMs included straw mulching (SM), downslope ridge cultivation (DC), downslope ridge cultivation + contour hedgerow planting (DCH), and contour ridge cultivation tillage (CC). A bare land treatment without any crops was used as a control (CK). We found that SWCMs increased SOC, TN, MBC, and MBN by 8-57%, 1-14%, 25-68%, and 17-35%, respectively, with greater increases in these variables in the CC and SM treatments and smaller increase in the DC treatment. Additionally, the effects of the SWCMs were greater at the top and middle of the slope than at the bottom of the slope, and the effects varied with soil depth. Moreover, the SWCMs decreased soil erodibility, with a lower K factor in the SWCMs treatments (0.018-0.049 t ha h ha-1 MJ-1 mm-1) than in the CK (0.042-0.068 t ha h ha-1 MJ-1 mm-1) and a greater decrease in the CC treatment. The effects of the SWCMs on soil erodibility mainly occurred through the regulation of SOC according to structural equation modeling. Overall, this study suggested that straw mulching and contour ridge cultivation tillage were the most effective strategies for restoring soil carbon and nitrogen and preventing soil erosion.

Meanwhile, jasmonic acid, an essential plant hormone, enhances plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses; however, its effect on tomato drought resistance remains unclear. In this study, a series of pot experiments were conducted to investigate the effects elicited via addition of exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA), an active ingredient of jasmonic acid, on tomato physiology, biochemistry, and transcription under two water conditions. The results indicate that 100 mu M MeJA application significantly improved drought resistance in tomato and increased the biomass. Moreover, water deficiency significantly decreased the tomato plant photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and root exudation and increased the leaf abscisic acid (ABA) content. Meanwhile, MeJA application increased root exudation and whole plant transpiration rate to maintain relatively high leaf water content. In leaves, specifically, MeJA increased the expression of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases and reduced ABA content, which might contribute to the maintenance of a high stomatal conductance. In addition, many genes involved in photosynthetic carbon metabolism and sugar transport were upregulated by MeJA, resulting in a low soluble sugar-to-starch ratio, to maintain plant growth. Collectively, these findings indicate that exogenous MeJA decreases ABA content to maintain high stomatal conductance and enhance root water uptake capacity to maintain improved leaf relative water status, consequently improving tomato drought resistance.					yan, jiakun/GRJ-3297-2022	yan, jiakun/0000-0001-8844-6098													1863-5466	1863-5474				APR	2022	16	2					183	193		10.1007/s11816-022-00753-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11816-022-00753-1		MAR 2022											WOS:000768686600001

Plant-pollinator interactions between generalists persist over time and space	ECOLOGY												Generalist species are the linchpins of networks, as they are important for maintaining network structure and function. Previous studies have shown that interactions between generalists tend to occur consistently across years and sites. However, the link between temporal and spatial interaction persistence across scales remains unclear. To address this gap, we collected data on plant-pollinator interactions throughout the flowering period for 5 yr across six plots in a subalpine meadow in the Rocky Mountains. We found that interactions between generalists tended to persist more in time and space such that interactions near the network core were more frequently recorded across years, within seasons, and among plots. We posit that species' tolerance of environmental variation across time and space plays a key role in generalization by regulating spatiotemporal overlap with interaction partners. Our results imply a role of spatiotemporal environmental variation in organizing species interactions, marrying niche concepts that emphasize species environmental constraints and their community role.

However, knowledge of the dynamics of SOC and STN stocks and their controlling factors after cropland abandonment is limited. Thus, this study investigated the changes in the SOC and STN stocks of loessal soil (Calcaric Regosols) with a chronosequence of 3, 8, 13, 18, 23 and 30 years following cropland abandonment on the Loess Plateau. As a whole, we examined 42 field plots and implemented multivariable linear regression analysis (MLRA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) using 22 influencing variables related to plant, soil and microbial properties to quantify the controls of SOC and SIN stocks. The results revealed that SOC and STN stocks significantly increased after cropland abandonment for 30 years, and there were minor decreases in C and N sequestrations in the early restoration stage (<18 years). The SOC and STN changes had significant positive correlations, in which that exhibited STN stocks shifted concurrently with the rate of relative SOC stock changes. The MLRA models demonstrated that the SOC stocks were primarily controlled by aboveground biomass, STN, fungi, and the ratio of fungi to bacteria, while STN stocks were mainly driven by root biomass. above-ground biomass, STN, fungi and the ratio of fungi to bacteria after cropland abandonment. The SEM models further demonstrated that plant productivity not only directly determined the variations in SOC and STN stocks but also changed the microbial community following post-cropland restoration. These results suggest that long-term (>18 years) cropland abandonment can be a successful approach for reinstating SOC and STN stocks, while plants and microbes together mediate microbial C and N stocks during vegetation succession in a semiarid region.

Much research on water consumption and sustainability of newly introduced vegetation types at the plot scale has been done in the Loess Plateau of China (LPC), typically using local scale measurements of soil water content (SWC). However, information collected at the plot scale cannot readily be up-scaled. Geophysical methods such as electromagnetic induction (EMI) offer large spatial coverage and, therefore, could bridge between the scales. A noninvasive, multicoil, frequency domain, EMI instrument was used to measure the apparent soil electrical conductivity (sigma(a)) from six effective depths under four typical land-covers (shrub, pasture, natural fallow, and crop) in the north of the LPC. Concurrently, SWC was monitored to a depth of 4 m using an array of 44 neutron probes distributed along the plots. The measurements of sigma(a) for six effective depths and the integrated SWC over these depths, show consistent behavior. High variability of sigma(a) under shrub cover, in particular, is consistent with long term variability of SWC, highlighting the potential unsustainability of this land cover. Linear relationships between SWC and sigma(a) were established using cumulative sensitivity forward models. The conductivity-SWC model parameters show clear variation with depth despite lack of appreciable textural variation. This is likely related to the combined effect of elevated pore water conductivity as was illustrated by the simulations obtained with water flow and solute transport models. The results of the study highlight the potential for the implementation of the EMI method for investigations of water distribution in the vadose zone of the LPC, and in particular for qualitative mapping of the vulnerability to excessive vegetation demands and hence, unsustainable land cover.					; Binley, Andrew/C-2487-2013	Turkeltaub, Tuvia/0000-0002-1278-3845; Binley, Andrew/0000-0002-0938-9070														1539-1663				JAN	2022	21	1							e20174	10.1002/vzj2.20174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.20174		DEC 2021											WOS:000732565700001

Particularly, with regard to international standards from the World Health Organization (WHO/2017), and the national standards from Sudanese Standard and Meteorology Organization for drinking water (SDS-044/2007). Twenty locations site were investigated to represent this important area, where its analysed for compliance with the national and international standards, furthermore, the suitability for drinking purpose was assessed by using water quality index (WQI) method. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was applied to predict the QWI by using the algorithm of feed forward back propagation artificial neural networks (BP ANN) for optimization. Physio-chemical assessments indicated that, water resources did not conform to the safe limits, especially heavy metals likes cadmium, which has the highest concentrations-hazard in almost all samples. High lead levels were observed at nineteen sites, while a high concentrations of nickel, and Total dissolved solids were observed at seven locations. The microbial assessment indicated most of locations did not conform to the safe limits, a high bacteria -hazard for Total coliform and Escherichia coli were observed in fourteen, and seven locations, respectively. Computed WQI values ranged from 35.61 to 337.52. ANN model showed much high prediction accuracy of WQI modeling with R2 values greater than 0.95 during training, testing and validation. WQI spatial distribution shown that, Red Sea State has unsuitable water quality in most of study sites (70%). The effects of heavy pollutants dominated on the water quality, and spread in these regions. This study conducted the first full-scale survey of the drinking water sources (ground and surface) in the Red Sea State of Sudan. Based on these results, we recommended that, an urgent measures such as a chemical treatments to treat the pollution, with/or filters installation should be implemented as soon as possible to manage and protect the water resources.

The monitoring of spatial-temporal changes in surface water bodies is crucial for the sustainable development and efficient utilization of water resources. In this study, Landsat series images on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, along with the HydroLAKES and China Reservoir datasets, were utilized to establish an extraction process for surface water bodies from 1986 to 2021 in the Yellow River Basin (YRB). The study aims to investigate the dynamics of surface water bodies and the driving factors within the YRB. The findings reveal an overall expansion tendency of surface water bodies in the YRB between 1986 and 2021. In the YRB, the total area of surface water bodies, natural lakes, and artificial reservoirs increased by 2983.8 km2 (40.4%), 281.1 km2 (11.5%), and 1017.6 km2 (101.7%), respectively. A total of 102 natural lakes expanded, while 23 shrank. Regarding artificial reservoirs, 204 expanded, and 77 shrank. The factors that contributed most to the increase in the surface water bodies were increasing precipitation and reservoir construction, whose contribution rates could reach 47% and 32.6%, respectively. Additionally, the rising temperatures melted permafrost, ice, and snow, positively correlating with water expansion in the upper reaches of the YRB, particularly natural lakes.																				2072-4292				NOV	2023	15	21							5157	10.3390/rs15215157	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15215157													WOS:001100476300001

However, the effect mechanisms of grass cover on runoff erosion dynamics on steep loess hillslopes is still not clear. Taking the typical forage species (Coreopsis) in semiarid areas as subject, this study quantified the effects of canopies and roots on controlling slope runoff and erosion. A series of field experiments were conducted in a loess hilly region of China. Field plots (5 m length, 2 m width, 25 degrees slope gradient) constructed with three ground covers (bare soil; Coreopsis with intact grass; only roots of Coreopsis), were applied with simultaneous simulated rainfall (60 mm h(-1)) and upslope inflow (10, 30, 50, 70, 90 L min(-1)). The results showed that compared with bare soil, intact grass significantly reduced runoff and soil loss rates by 16.6% and 62.4% on average, and decreased soil erodibility parameter by 66.3%. As inflow rate increased, the reductions in runoff and soil loss rates increased from 2.93 to 14.00 L min(-1) and 35.11 to 121.96 g m(-2) min(-1), respectively. Canopies relatively contributed 66.7% to lowering flow velocity, turbulence, weakening erosive force and increasing hydraulic resistance. Roots played a predominant role in reducing soil loss and enhancing soil anti-erodibility, with relative contributions of 78.8% and 73.8%. Furthermore, the maximum erosion depth reduced by Coreopsis was at the upper slope section which was previously eroded the most. These results demonstrated the efficiency of Coreopsis cover in controlling runoff and erosion on steep loess slopes, especially under large inflow rates and at upper slope sections. We suggest protecting Coreopsis with intact grass at upper slope sections, while the aboveground grass biomass can be used for grazing or harvesting at middle and lower slope sections, with roots reserved.						chen, lin/0000-0003-2029-2074; Yu, Haijun/0000-0002-5506-5317; Gong, Yuwei/0000-0001-9460-1533; Tian, Pei/0000-0002-8200-7905													1672-6316	1993-0321				MAY	2023	20	5					1402	1423		10.1007/s11629-022-7775-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-022-7775-x													WOS:001001382100015

In this 2-yr experiment, the alfalfa-silage corn intercropping system (AC) with nitrogen (N) fertilization rates of 0, 60, 120, and 180 kg N ha(-1) and corn plant densities of 30,000, 45,000, and 60,000 plants ha(-1) was compared with the monocultured corn (CK) managed using the local farmers' practice. Intercropping with alfalfa significantly decreased the dry matter (DM) yield of the corn by 31.5% on average, while increasing the N application rate and corn plant density promoted DM yield and crude protein (CP) accumulation of the intercropped corn, and the intercropping system could achieve the same CP yield as CK-it did in most cases. Although the DM contents, pH values, and NH3-N concentrations were decreased in the mixed silage, its fermentation quality was not reduced and the CP, water soluble carbohydrates, and lactic acid contents were dramatically increased by 16.3%, 17.8%, and 72.9% compared with those of CK, respectively. For the opposite effects of N fertilization and corn density on silage quality, the treatment combination with a medium corn density (45,000 plants ha(-1)) fertilized at a medium N rate (120 kg N ha(-1)) was evaluated as the optimum for more balanced system productivity, silage nutritive values and fermentative characteristics during the coexisting period.

Currently, contributions of upslope inflow and rainfall to soil loss and identification of sediment sources in a ridge-furrow system are still unclear. A set of experiments on 10-m long, 2-m wide field runoff plots at a 5 degrees slope gradient were conducted in the Chinese Mollisol region to quantify the effects of upslope inflow and rainfall on hillslope erosion and to discriminate sediment contributions between ridges and furrows in a longitudinal ridge-tillage system. The experimental treatments included five upslope inflow rates alone (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 L min(-1)), two rainfall intensities alone (50 and 100 mm h(-1)) and the five inflow rates combined with the two rainfall intensities. A stereoscopic photogrammetry method was used to measure micro-topographic conditions before and after each run. The results showed that, compared with the inflow-only treatments, soil losses increased by 1.4-5.2 times and 2.5-14.0 times under the combined treatments of the five inflow rates and two rainfall intensities, respectively. The contributions of the synergistic effects increased with the increase of rainfall intensity. Moreover, in the five upslope inflow-only treatments, soil erosion mainly occurred in the bottom of furrows and ridge toe slopes; while for the combined treatments, ridge sideslope erosion dominated as soil loss from ridge areas accounted for 51.3 %-60.9 % and 53.0 %-61.8 % for the 50 and 100 mm h(-1) rainfall intensities, respectively. Therefore, ridge sideslope erosion may be the main sediment source in the longitudinal ridge-tillage system under the bare conditions.

However, reliable quantification of their interactive effects on erosion is still lacking. Therefore, a laboratory study was conducted to reveal the effects of RI and GWS on hillslope erosion. A soil box (5.0 m long, 0.5 m wide, and 0.5 m deep) was subjected to rainfall simulation experiments under free drainage (FD) and GWS conditions. The effect of RI was studied by dissipating raindrop energy, i.e. without raindrop impact (WRI). The results indicated that compared with WRI, RI increased the runoff rate, soil loss and sediment concentration by about 3-14%, 74-696%, and 64-560%, respectively. With a higher runoff rate of 27-54%, GWS increased soil loss and sediment concentration about 70-588% and 27-411% compared with FD, respectively. A power function relation were found between soil losses and runoff rate. The increasing rate of soil loss increased with runoff followed the order: GWS + RI > FD + RI > GWS + WRI > FD + WRI. The erosion and sediment yield seemed to be detachment-limited. As a result of crust formation, RI, compared with WRI, marginally enhanced the average flow velocity and shear stress, and reduced the resistance coefficient. The effects of GWS on flow parameters were more pronounced than RI. The mean weight diameter of aggregates was reduced by about 13-69% because of breakdown by raindrop impact or slaking. The loss of < 0.25 mm aggregate accounted for 77-98% of the total aggregate loss in all treatments.

Knowing local Tibetans' perceptions of climate and ecological changes is important for exploring the climate and vegetation changes in this vast and remote plateau. We interviewed residents in three counties, Dege, Seda, and Ruoergai, on the eastern Tibetan Plateau and analyzed their perceptions of climate and ecological changes; then, we compared the results with those from instrumental observations. The results showed that residents are sensitive to changes in temperature and extreme weather, and the perceptions of temperature change are consistent with meteorological observations. Both remote sensing observations and local perception showed an advanced green-up date in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. More than half of informants perceived an earlier start date and a later end date of Ophiocordyceps sinensis harvesting, which indicated an advance of vegetation spring phenology and a possibly upward distribution extension in elevation under climate warming, respectively. The results also indicated that it is necessary to explore the vegetation phenology of the Tibetan Plateau from the perspective of sub-regions. More research on the views of environmental change should be carried out in different sub-regions of the Tibetan Plateau, and the interrelationship between perceptions is also worth exploring.																			1436-3798	1436-378X				MAY 7	2020	20	2							56	10.1007/s10113-020-01629-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-020-01629-2													WOS:000533889700003

However, whether NT systems are as productive as those relying on conventional tillage (CT) is a controversial issue, fraught by a high variability over time and space. Here, we expand existing datasets to include the results of the most recent field experiments, and we produce a global dataset comparing the crop yields obtained under CT and NT systems. In addition to crop yield, our dataset also reports information on crop growing season, management practices, soil characteristics and key climate parameters throughout the experimental year. The final dataset contains 4403 paired yield observations between 1980 and 2017 for eight major staple crops in 50 countries. This dataset can help to gain insight into the main drivers explaining the variability of the productivity of NT and the consequence of its adoption on crop yields.

The native parasitoid, Habrobracon hebetor Say (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), is currently being promoted for augmentative biological control of the pest in the Sahel. The current study was carried out to identify the right time for releases of the parasitoid using either pearl millet growing stage, or pest occurrence as reference, and to determine the optimal number of parasitoids needed to cover a given area. Our results indicate that release of parasitoids at the panicle emergence stage or six weeks after first sight of eggs of H. albipunctella lead to highest parasitism of H. albipunctella larvae by H. hebetor. The dose of 800 parasitoids for a distance of 3 km radius was enough for controlling H. albipunctella. The implications of the results are discussed toward cost effective and practical recommendation adapted to the Sahelian conditions.

Exploring the exchange process is of great significance to understand the formation and change of weather and climate. Based on the ERA5 reanalysis data and a process-based land surface model (the Ecosystem-Atmosphere Simulation Scheme), this study analysed the spatiotemporal variations and influencing factors in the energy budget in the Loess Plateau (LP). The results showed that from 1990 to 2017, the average annual surface net radiation (Rn) and latent heat (LE) in the LP showed a decreasing trend. The Rn and LE presented an increased spatial pattern from northwest to southeast. On a monthly scale, the Grain for Green (GFG) project amplified the negative effect in the period of November to February and September, but diminished the negative effect in other months. Climate change contributed more to energy exchange than land cover change during the study period. Our results provide useful information for developing adaptive strategies for the region to adapt to global climate change.

Jim			Simulating nitrate release from an unsaturated coal waste rock dump	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Knowledge of the controls affecting the release of contaminants from waste rock dumps is critical for developing strategies to mitigate downstream impacts on water quality. In this study, a three-dimensional model of a large coal waste rock dump constructed in the Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada was developed to capture the impact of construction history (1981-2012) and solute transport on nitrate (NO3-) release over a 100-year timeframe. The model consisted of 21, one-dimensional finite element models that represented the temporal evolution of the dump. Nitrate, derived from undetonated blast products, was assumed to be present at the time of waste rock placement and was simulated as a conservative species. The simulated pattern of NO3- release to the surface water receptor occurred approximately 8 years before its measured arrival. This time lag is attributed to displacement of the water within a basal alluvial aquifer by dump effluent. The simulated patterns of historic releases corrected for the 8-year time lag, compare favourably with monitoring data and suggest the dominant hydrogeological and geochemical mechanisms are captured in the model. The model indicated the flushing of NO3- from the dump should be complete by about 2042 with a peak effluent concentration of NO3- in 2008. The addition of reclamation covers to the model resulted in an immediate decrease in the annual NO3- loading rate but extended the time frame for NO3- release from the dump relative to the no cover case. The model also showed that the timing of cover placement had little impact on NO3- release relative to the no cover case due to long duration of waste rock placement (similar to 30 years) over a relatively large footprint.

However, quantifying the impacts of freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) at different initial soil water contents (ISWCs) on soil erodibility is challenging due to the complex interactive soil mechanical responses. In this study, direct shear strength and soil disintegration tests were conducted to quantify soil erodibility indices. Seven FTCs (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 13) and three ISWCs (16.5, 24.8 and 33.0%) were employed to investigate soil shear behavior and disintegration properties for two Mollisol soils. Results showed that repeated FTCs had cumulative impacts on soil mechanical properties, and the 10th FTCs might be the threshold number for influencing soil erodibility. The soil shear strengths decreased by 1.1-15.1% and 9.2-30.5% under four normal stresses at the first and 13th FTCs, respectively, for these two soils. Soil cohesion generally decreased with the increase of FTCs. Soil internal friction angle showed no trend with FTCs at the 16.5% and 24.8% water contents but a decreasing trend at the 33.0% water content. Soil disintegration rate increased with FTC and reached a maximum value at the 10th cycle but decreased with the increase of ISWC. Soil disintegration of the two Mollisols showed a sharp disintegration of about 60% in 133 s. This study provides a new understanding of the response of erodibility to freeze-thaw conditions for two Mollisols.

Characterization of heterosis and genomic prediction-based establishment of heterotic patterns for developing better hybrids in pigeonpea	PLANT GENOME												Whole-genome resequencing (WGRS) of 396 lines, consisting of 104 hybrid parental lines and 292 germplasm lines, were used to study the molecular basis of midparent heterosis (MPH) and to identify complementary heterotic patterns in pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] hybrids. The lines and hybrids were assessed for yield and yield-related traits in multiple environments. Our analysis showed positive MPH values in 78.6% of hybrids, confirming the potential of hybrid breeding in pigeonpea. By using genome-wide prediction and association mapping approaches, we identified 129 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 52 copy number variations with significant heterotic effects and also established a high-yielding heterotic pattern in pigeonpea. In summary, our study highlights the role of WGRS data in the study and use of heterosis in crops where hybrid breeding is expected to boost selection gain in order to ensure global food security.

We use a process-based model to estimate the terrestrial carbon storage in Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) and to predict the change of carbon storage over the next 100 years. The results show that the vegetation carbon (VC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage were 8.97 and 28.85 Pg C in the YREB from 1981 to 2005, respectively. The highest VC density is distributed in the southern region of the YREB, and the highest SOC density distributes in subalpine and alpine area of the western region of the YREB. Carbon storage in the YREB continued to increase from 1981 to 2005 and in future projections, under both the representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) and the RCP8.5 scenarios. The increased rate of carbon storage in the YREB under the RCP8.5 scenario is higher than that under the RCP4.5 scenario. Under the RCP4.5 scenario, the increasing trend of VC storage tends to be reduced after the 2060s; conversely, the increase of both VC and SOC is accelerated after the 2050s under the RCP8.5 scenario. The SOC density in Western Sichuan will decrease in the future, especially under the RCP8.5 scenario. Western Sichuan has the highest SOC density in the YREB; therefore, it is important to manage the ecosystems there in order to cope with significant warming. The positive impact of warming and the CO2 fertilization effect on vegetation growth and carbon uptake will be predominantly attributed to the increase of terrestrial carbon storage in the YREB. However, warming will stimulate the decomposition of soil organic carbon, contributing directly to reducing SOC storage in high-altitude regions (e.g., alpine and subalpine regions of Western Sichuan).					wang, jiajun/JRW-6032-2023; Zhang, Shiwei/JIY-4344-2023	Yan, Huimin/0000-0003-0678-0397; Gu, Fengxue/0000-0003-3587-9628													2045-7758					JUN	2021	11	12					7211	7225		10.1002/ece3.7414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7414		JUN 2021						34188807					WOS:000658039000001
J	Wu, LM; Chen, SC; Wang, B				Wu, La-Mei; Chen, Si-Chong; Wang, Bo			An allometry between seed kernel and seed coat shows greater investment in physical defense in small seeds	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the StudyNumerous studies have treated the mass of a whole seed as an integrated unit, although the components seed kernel and seed coat play different roles and are subject to different evolutionary selection pressures. In this study, we provided the first global-scale quantification of the relative biomass investments in seed coats and seed kernels. We tested the following hypotheses: there is a negative allometry between seed kernel mass and seed coat mass, and therefore, seed coat ratio (SCR) is negatively correlated with seed mass. MethodsWe compiled a global-scale data set from the published literature, including 680 plant species from 420 genera and 108 families. The relationships between seed components were quantified using standardized major axis regression, ordinary least squares regression, and phylogenetic independent analyses. Key ResultsWe found a weak but significantly negative allometry between seed kernel mass and seed coat mass, which resulted in a negative relationship between seed mass and SCR. Similar results were found after accounting for the phylogeny. ConclusionsThe finding that smaller seeds invest more in protective tissues but less in stored reserves may explain the general prediction that larger seeds suffer greater predation than smaller seeds. Furthermore, this weak allometry may also explain, at least in part, why so many studies failed to identify a clear pattern of the effect of seed mass on many ecological processes. Our study suggests that the allometry between the two seed components must be considered when evaluating the ecological significance and evolutionary history of seed mass.

In this study, we evaluated the influence of earthworms on soil nutrient distribution and soil microbial diversity, under different tillage measures. Three cultivation methods [tillage (CT), no-tillage (NT), and no-tillage with straw (NTS)] were applied to the field. Five earthworm densities (0, 20, 50, 100, and 200 individuals/plot) were tested under each cultivation mode. Our findings showed that earthworm density improved organic C, N, and P contents in the tilled soil layer (0-30 cm). Contrastingly, in conventional tillage (CT) treatment, increases in earthworm density reduced the total N and P contents and increased the organic C content of the soil. Greater earthworm densities were associated with higher soil microbial abundances and diversities under NTS treatment, whereas the opposite effect was observed under CT treatment. Different earthworm densities also resulted in significant structural changes in the soil microbial community. Overall, these findings suggest that under the same farming method, earthworm density affects soil microorganism composition and diversity as well as soil environmental factors.

However, little is known about the effects of soil amendment strategies on crop growth via regulating soil moisture and photosynthesis in a ridge and furrow cropping system. Here, field experiments were carried out in 2017 and 2018 in semi-arid areas of Loess Plateau, northwest China to investigate the effects of integrated use of ridge and furrow planting and manure amendment on grain yields of maize. Four treatments were designed: CK (flat planting with 100% chemical fertilizer), RFC (ridge and furrow planting with 100% chemical fertilizer), RFR (ridge and furrow planting with 100% control-released fertilizer), and RFM (ridge and furrow planting with 50% manure fertilizer + 50% N fertilizer). On average, RFM increased photosynthetic rates (Pn) by 74%, followed by RFR by 47%, and RFC by 26%, compared to CK. Also, stomatal conductance (Cd), transpiration rates (Tr), and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) were highest with RFM, followed by RFR and RFC. Averaged across the two years, RFM conserved 10% more soil water storage (SWS) than CK did at harvest, followed by RFR with an increment by 8%. However, RFC consumed more soil water than CK did, with its ETc 8% higher than CK. Consequently, spring maize treated with RFM suffered less drought stress, especially in 2017 when precipitation was insufficient. On average, grain yields and water use efficiency of RFM were increased by 18% and 27%, compared to CK. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that there existed significant positive correlation between SWS in top layers and grain yields, while SWS in deep layers had negative effects on grain yields. In conclusion, the incorporation of manure into ridge and furrow planting system can be an efficient agronomic practice to improve plant photosynthesis, optimize soil moisture, and boost grain yields in semi-arid areas of Loess Plateau, northwest China.

We previously detected a stable major-effect quantitative trait locus QPH.caas-5AL for plant height on chromosome 5A in a recombinant inbred line population of the cross 'Doumai x Shi 4185' using the wheat 90 K SNP assay. Here , QPH.caas-5AL was confirmed using new phenotypic data in additional environment and new-developed markers. We identified nine heterozygous recombinant plants for fine mapping of QPH.caas-5AL and developed 14 breeder-friendly kompetitive allele-specific PCR markers in the region of QPH.caas-5AL based on the genome re-sequencing data of parents. Phenotyping and genotyping analyses of secondary populations derived from the self-pollinated heterozygous recombinant plants delimited QPH.caas-5AL into an approximate 3.0 Mb physical region (521.0-524.0 Mb) according to the Chinese Spring reference genome. This region contains 45 annotated genes, and six of them were predicted as the candidates of QPH.caas-5AL based on genome and transcriptome sequencing analyses. We further validated that QPH.caas-5AL has significant effects on plant height but not yield component traits in a diverse panel of wheat cultivars; its dwarfing allele is frequently used in modern wheat cultivars.

Yield losses due to drought stress can best be resolved by breeding new, drought-tolerant cultivars, however, the genetic gains in drought resistance of different maize cultivars especially under precise water control conditions were not systematically studied. The objectives of this study were to assess 1) the change in yield and WUE of different cultivars from the 1970s through the 2010s under precise water control conditions and 2) find out the main factors affecting the yield and WUE change of different cultivars. Methods:We selected nine hybrids from different eras for a detailed field study under three different water treatments (full irrigation, moderate drought, and intense drought) in a rainout shelter at Hengshui (115 degrees 40 & PRIME;E, 37 degrees 44 & PRIME;N) in southern Hebei province in 2018 and 2019. We compared the grain yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of different cultivars from the 1970s through the 2010s under drought-stress (moderate drought and intense drought) and fully-irrigated conditions. Results:The maize yield and WUE showed a significant linear increase with the year of release. The average yield gains were 111, 113.4 and 121.3 kg ha- 1yr- 1 under fully-irrigated, moderate and intense drought conditions while the WUE gains were 0.31, 0.38 and 0.72 kg ha-1 mm-1 yr- 1 respectively. The yield reduction ratio showed a significant linear decrease from the 1970 s through the 2010s under both moderate water deficit and intense water deficit which were 0.51 % and 0.99 % yr- 1, indicating that modern cultivars had better drought resistance than older ones. With increased water stress, the yield gap and yield reduction ratio between full irrigation and drought treatments (moderate drought and intense drought) increased significantly. The significant increase in the number of ears per hectare and the number of kernels per ear was the main reason for maize yield increase with the year of release from 1970s to 2010s under drought treatments. Under drought stress, the uniformity of yield component decreased significantly compared to the fully-irrigated treatment. In addition, an overly large leaf area was not conducive to drought resistance. Conclusions:Modern cultivars had better drought resistance than older ones. Selecting hybrids with higher uniformity and smaller leaf area was beneficial to improve the maize drought resistance. Implications: The results of this study will be beneficial for the breeding and selecting drought-resistant cultivars.

In this study, a warming and step-wised stop-warming experiment was conducted to examine whether the response of soil respiration (Rs) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) persists post-warming and to understand the underlying mechanisms. The treatment plots (10 plots) were warmed (similar to 1.5 degrees C at 10 cm soil depth) in 2017, then warming was stopped in one group (5 plots) in 2018 (WS18) and stopped in another group (the remaining 5 plots) in 2019 (WS19). Plant biomass, soil microbial biomass, and soil microbial community composition were measured from 2017 to 2019.On average, warming increased Rh by 28% in 2017. The Rh in WS18 was stilled increased by 26% in 2018, which was lower than the warming induced increase in Rh in WS19 at the same period. The Rh in WS18 showed no difference with the control and that in WS19 was higher than the control in only June in 2019. Aboveground biomass of WS18 and WS19 increased by 20% and 29%, respectively in 2017, and they were still increased by 12% and 17% in 2019 even the warming stopped one two years and one years, respectively. Belowground biomass, microbial biomass, and diversity indices showed no significant differences among treatments in 2018 or 2019. The fungal community was significantly different among WS18, W19, and the control in both 2018 and 2019. The relative abundance of Ascomycetes, which made the largest contribution to the differences in the fungal community, was negatively correlated with Rh (r = -0.4, n = 30, p < 0.05). Our results indicate a warming legacy effect on the microbial decomposition of soil organic C, resulting from the increase in plant productivity and fungal community change when warming stopped.					zhang, wenjuan/A-9413-2011; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/L-8526-2013; xue, xue/JTV-1627-2023	zhang, wenjuan/0000-0002-9704-766X; Tsunekawa, Atsushi/0000-0002-7690-0633; 													0929-1393	1873-0272				OCT	2021	166								104093	10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104093		JUN 2021											WOS:000679310400002

Outdoor or indoor occupational exposure to highly volatile and lipid-soluble hydrocarbons has been linked to impairment of respiratory, cardiovascular, and liver functions. This study is aimed at determining the potential impact of occupational exposure to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in varying work environments. Respiratory symptoms, oxidative stress, cardio-pulmonary, and liver function parameters were assessed among LPG workers in the Kano metropolis, Nigeria. Study subjects were recruited from LPG filling stations and street LPG retail shops. Results of the study showed that the forced vital capacity (FVC) of LPG station workers was significantly lower (2.81 L/min; H = 22.473, p < 0.001) relative to the values recorded among LPG retail shop workers and the controls (3.54 L/min and 4.24 L/min respectively). A similar reduction was seen in the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and the forced expiratory flow in 25-75 % of forced vital capacity (FEF25-75) obtained from the filling station workers (H = 32.722, p < 0.001 & H = 15.655, p <0.001 respectively). Furthermore, exposure to non-combusted LPG increased systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and serum liver enzymes.

To explore the vertical diffusion characteristics of CO2 in deep soil profiles and their driving factors, we calculated CO2 flux and measured environmental factors in sections situated from 0 to 200 cm in Robinia pseudoacacia forests (Loess Hilly Region, China). The results found that (1) Deep soils (> 80 cm) exhibited a stable contribution to the soil-atomosphere CO2 flux, ranging from 21.81% to 24.42%. (2) The total CO2 storage within deep layers accounted for 55.03-79.98% of the total storage in the layer at 0-200 cm. The stable storage of CO2 at deep layers helped suppress the mineralization of organic carbon in deep soil; (3) Soil temperature, moisture, CO2 concentration, aerated porosity, SOC content, bulk density, total porosity, root density, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), pH, and profile depth explained 86.0% and 89.1% of the variance in CO2 flux at shallow and deep layers, respectively. Soil moisture was the key limiting factor for vertical differentiation of CO2 fluxes in deep and shallow layers. The sensitivity of temperature and aerated porosity on CO2 flux increased with soil depth increasing. While the soil microbial biomass carbon had a weaker effect on CO2 flux both in the deep and shallow layers. Root stimulation was more likely to induce CO2 emission in deep layers. However, increase of pH was more conducive to CO2 fixation and flux reduction in deep layers. Our results help to further clarify the mechanisms of carbon emission in deep soil carbon pools, and provide a theoretical basis for scientific evaluation of soil carbon emissions.

Understanding the pore complexity of the loess may be crucial for exploring soil functional properties and improving knowledge on hydrological dynamic processes occurring in the soil plant atmosphere continuum. Twelve undisturbed columns of four typical soil types, namely, aeolian sandy, light dark loessial, loessial, and Lou soils, were collected for the multifractal analysis of X-ray computed tomography images. The heterogeneity of soil pore distribution and the measure of porosity dispersion relative to the pore size dispersion in the loessial and Lou soils were significantly lower than those of the aeolian sandy and light dark loessial soils. The loessial soil exhibited the highest symmetry of singularity spectra and presented the lowest variability for pore arrangement. Most correlations among parameters of soil properties, multifractal characteristics, as well as soil macropore morphology and connectivity characteristics, were significant (p < 0.05 or 0.01). The multiple regression models of the theoretical saturated hydraulic conductivity and total porosity incorporated all types of the parameters, and the multifractal parameter Delta D was the dominant variable. Macropore connectivity parameters were commonly superior to the morphology ones when the links between macropore characteristics and multifractal parameters were considered. Meantime, the number of macropores acted as a crucial parameter influencing the complexity of soil pore structures. Overall, it is of great significance to integrate the soil pore complexity into the comprehensive understanding of pore function. This study also provides an effective reference for optimizing soil structures, improving the soil water holding capacity, and balancing the relationship between water and ecosystems in the Loess Plateau.

Therefore, present experiment with 20 diverse urdbean genotypes was executed over three environments in northern hilly terrain under rainfed conditions. AMMI analysis revealed that environments (E), genotypes (G) and G x E interaction effects were found significant for grain yield (GY). The environment, genotypes and their interactions accounted 46.29%, 25.9% and 22.23% of the total variation. The interaction principal components Axis 1(IPCA 1) and IPCA 2 of AMMI were founds significant (P<0.01) for GY based on Gallob's test. The IPCA1 accounted more than 89% of the G x E interactions effects for the GY. In GGE biplot PC1 and PC2 captured 99.3% of the total variations. Based on GGE and AMMI biplots the genotypes with wider adaptability were VBG 12-034(G7), IPU 13-3(G16) and COBG 13-04(G13). These genotypes are suitable for hilly terrains of northern India and can be further utilized as donor in future urdbean improvement programme.

Crop Performance in Sandy Soil	AGRONOMY-BASEL												In arid and semi-arid regions, desertification threatens crop production because it reduces the soil's capacity to retain water and soil nutrients. At two fertilizer levels (90 kg N hm(-2)and 45 kg P hm(-2)and 270 kg N hm(-2)and 135 kg P hm(-2)), the effects of soft rock (sand: soft rocks = 3:1) and biochar (4500 kg hm(-2)) applications on soil moisture, soil nutrients, and millet (Setaria italicaL.) photosynthesis, yield, and its agronomic traits (biomass, thousand kernel weight, harvest index) were investigated in a field experiment in the Mu Us Sandy Land of China in 2018-2019. The addition of biochar and soft rock singly increased soil water content, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen (AN), total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP), and organic matter content significantly, suggesting that their application may increase the nutrient and water holding capacity of soil. Application of biochar and soft rock singly increased the net photosynthesis rate of millet flag leaf, at the flowering stage, from 15.97% to 56.26%. Biochar and soft rock application increased the yield range (2109.0 kg hm(-2)to 5024.7 kg hm(-2)) from 5.26% to 54.60% under the same fertilizer level. Correlation analyses showed grain yield was significantly correlated with photosynthesis rate at the flowering stage, which was significantly correlated with soil AN at flowering, soil TP at flowering and harvest, and soil TN at flowering. These results indicated that the application of biochar and soft rock singly could increase soil fertilizer holding capacity to improve the photosynthesis rate at flowering, and, therefore, lead to improvements in crop yield.

Legumes regulate grassland soil N cycling and its response to variation in species diversity and N supply but not CO<sub>2</sub>	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Legumes are an important component of plant diversity that modulate nitrogen (N) cycling in many terrestrial ecosystems. Limited knowledge of legume effects on soil N cycling and its response to global change factors and plant diversity hinders a general understanding of whether and how legumes broadly regulate the response of soil N availability to those factors. In a 17-year study of perennial grassland species grown under ambient and elevated (+180 ppm) CO2 and ambient and enriched (+4 g N m(-2) year(-1)) N environments, we compared pure legume plots with plots dominated by or including other herbaceous functional groups (and containing one or four species) to assess the effect of legumes on N cycling (net N mineralization rate and inorganic N pools). We also examined the effects of numbers of legume species (from zero to four) in four-species mixed plots on soil N cycling. We hypothesized that legumes would increase N mineralization rates most in those treatments with the greatest diversity and the greatest relative limitation by and competition for N. Results partially supported these hypotheses. Plots with greater dominance by legumes had greater soil nitrate concentrations and mineralization rates. Higher species richness significantly increased the impact of legumes on soil N metrics, with 349% and 505% higher mineralization rates and nitrate concentrations in four-species plots containing legumes compared to legume-free four-species plots, in contrast to 185% and 129% greater values, respectively, in pure legume than nonlegume monoculture plots. N-fertilized plots had greater legume effects on soil nitrate, but lower legume effects on net N mineralization. In contrast, neither elevated CO2 nor its interaction with legumes affected net N mineralization. These results indicate that legumes markedly influence the response of soil N cycling to some, but not all, global change drivers.

The objective of this study was to test and identify agricultural and industrial products and by-products (PBPs) that reduce the speed of manure decomposition and, potentially, increase SOM. Raw poultry litter (PL) was amended with selected PBPs (15% fresh weight) and incubated for 1-3 mo. Unamended PL lost an average of 19% of its dry weight after 1 mo incubation and 24% of its dry weight after 3 mo. Monitoring the CO2 release during a 1-mo incubation revealed that decomposition and weight loss of unamended PL is greatest in the first 2 d. Amending PL with Al-2(SO4)(3)center dot 18H(2)O and CaO reduced cumulative CO2 release and final dry biomass loss during the incubation period of 1-3 mo. Amending PL with Al-2(SO4)(3)center dot 18H(2)O reduced PL temperature by up to 14 degrees C and pH by similar to 4.0, whereas CaO elevated its temperature by up to 24 degrees C and pH by similar to 4.0. Both products suppressed total culturable bacteria and reduced dehydrogenase activity soon after mixing. Amending PL with flue gas desulfurization gypsum, CaCO3, cement kiln dust, or biochar either enhanced or had no effect on suppressing litter decomposition. Our results overall show that the decomposition of PL and possibly other manures may be slowed and that the soil-residence life of manure C may be increased using PBPs that raise or lower manure pH and temperature.					li, yuanyuan/GZA-4435-2022	Zhang, Fengbao/0000-0003-1003-256X; Feng, Gary/0000-0001-7783-1644; Tewolde, Haile/0000-0002-8610-2619; Brooks, John/0000-0002-6142-6430													0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR	2021	50	2					364	374		10.1002/jeq2.20189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.20189		FEB 2021						33368306					WOS:000615995500001

Maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes exhibit variations in Cd accumulations. This study examined variations in Cd accumulation and tolerance among four maize genotypes with contrasting root morphology. The four maize genotypes were cultivated in a semi-hydroponic system with three Cd concentrations (0, 10, 20 mu mol L-1). The effects of Cd on plant growth and physiology were assessed 39 days after transplanting. Results showed that root characteristics were positively correlated with root Cd accu-mulation and the bioconcentration factor under Cd20 treatment. Genotypes Shengrui999 and Zhengdan958 exhibited higher total Cd content than Xundan29 and Zhongke11 under Cd20 conditions. Cd toxicity led to membrane degradation of chloroplast mesophyll cells, loosening and swelling of grana lamella, and reduced starch reserves. The greater tolerance of Shengrui999 and Zhengdan958 was contributed to factors such as root biomass, shallower root depth, higher Cd content, accumulation of osmolyte such as soluble protein, antioxidant activities such as catalase (CAT), and the presence of phytohormone gibberellic acid. The study establishes a link between root morphology, Cd accumulation, and tolerance in maize plants, as demonstrated by the higher Cd accumulation and shallower root system in Cd-tolerant genotypes. This research provides a foundation for breeding maize cultivars better suited for adaptation to moderate Cd-contaminated environments.

Amino sugars, neutral sugars and uronic acids have been used as microbial necromass biomarkers to trace the origin and composition of microbial residues in the SOM pool. Due to the structural complexity of sugars, derivatization reactions and high-throughput analytical methods are required to separate and quantify these sugar-related compounds. Our aim was to develop a rapid and sensitive assay to measure amino sugar, neutral sugar and uronic acid compounds using pre-column 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PMP) derivatization. PMP-derivatives were separated and quantified via reversed phase (RP) ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS). The method was validated and applied on hydrolyzed peptidoglycans and the biomass of archaeal, bacterial, fungal and plant species, as well as with soils. This developed PMP method allowed the separation and quantification of 18 sugar-related compounds, including four amino sugars, three N-acetyl amino sugars, eight neutral sugars, and three uronic acids within 20 min. This PMP method showed a precision for isotope enrichment detection of 0.03-0.05 atom % 13C for D-glucose and D-glucosamine. This is the first time talosaminuronic acid (deriving from archaeal pseudopeptidoglycan) was identified and quantified using PMP derivatization. The application of this novel PMP method on pure hydrolyzed biomass and soils, showed the successful chromatographic and mass spectrometric separation and quantification of amino sugar, neutral sugar and uronic acid compounds. A multivariate analysis using these sugar-related PMP derivatives showed a clustering of the species according to their respective taxonomic group (archaea, gram-positive bacteria, gramnegative bacteria, fungi and plants). The modified PMP method can be applied to identify and quantify soil microbial necromass biomarkers, as well as their contribution to SOM. The sensitive isotope tracer detection allows tracing isotopically labeled materials into necromass biomarkers in SOM pools.

In this study, the sap flow velocity (SF) of Populus simonii under different categories of degradation (LD, lightly degraded; MD, moderately degraded; SD, seriously degraded) during the growing season in the water-wind erosion crisscross region of the Chinese Loess Plateau was continuously monitored and estimated using the modified Jarvis-Stewart (MJS), modified process-based (MBTA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. We found that the daily SF of P. simonii under the three categories of degradation was significantly different (p < 0.05), and degradation degree was negatively correlated with SF. Soil water deficit significantly reduced SF (p < 0.05). Soil water conditions and P. simonii degradation change the peak time of SF rather than the startup time. Three models give good performance for simulating the daily SF of degraded P. simonii, especially the MJS model. The stress of vapour pressure deficit (VPD) on SF first decreases and then increases with increasing VPD, and the VPD threshold is LD < MD < SD. The results provide a valuable reference for revealing the causes of degradation and assessing the drought resistance of plantation ecosystems in water-limited areas.					戴, 军杰/GQP-3514-2022; Wang, Li/AAE-6919-2022	戴, 军杰/0000-0002-2487-084X; Zhao, Ying/0000-0001-7293-8880; wang, li/0000-0002-2697-4802													1085-3278	1099-145X				JAN 30	2023	34	2					493	505		10.1002/ldr.4474	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4474		OCT 2022											WOS:000865740100001

Characteristics of PAs encoding genes in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and their function under cold stress (CS) are currently unknown. In this study, the potential role of PAs along with the antioxidative defense systems were assessed in two chickpea genotypes (Sel96th11439, cold-tolerant and ILC533, cold-sensitive) under CS conditions. Six days after exposure to CS, the leaf H2O2 content and electrolyte leakage index increased in the sensitive genotype by 47.7 and 59 %, respectively, while these values decreased or remained unchanged, respectively, in the tolerant genotype. In tolerant genotype, the enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (by 50 %) was accompanied by unchanged activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT) as well as the accumulation of glutathione (GSH) (by 43 %) on the sixth day of CS. Higher levels of putrescine (Put) (322 %), spermidine (Spd) (45 %), spermine (Spm) (69 %) and the highest ratio of Put/(Spd + Spm) were observed in tolerant genotype compared to the sensitive one on the sixth day of CS. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) accumulation was 74 % higher in tolerant genotype compared to the sensitive one on the sixth day of CS. During CS, the activity of diamine oxidase (DAO) and polyamine oxidase (PAO) increased in tolerant (by 3.02- and 2.46-fold) and sensitive (by 2.51- and 2.8-fold) genotypes, respectively, in comparison with the respective non-stressed plants (normal conditions). The highest activity of DAO and PAO in the tolerant genotype was accompanied by PAs decomposition and a peak in GABA content on the sixth day of CS. The analysis of chickpea genome revealed the presence of five PAs biosynthetic genes, their chromosomal locations, and cis-regulatory elements. A significant increase in transcript levels of arginine decarboxylase (ADC) (24.26- and 7.96-fold), spermidine synthase 1 (SPDS1) (3.03- and 1.53-fold), SPDS2 (5.5- and 1.62-fold) and spermine synthase (SPMS) (3.92- and 1.65-fold) genes was detected in tolerant and sensitive genotypes, respectively, whereas the expression of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) genes decreased significantly under CS conditions in both genotypes. Leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid contents exhibited declining trends in the sensitive genotype, while these photosynthetic pigments were stable in the tolerant genotype due to the superior performance of defensive processes under CS conditions. Overall, these results suggested the specific roles of putative PAs genes and PAs metabolism in development of effective CT responses in chickpea.

J	Zeng, Y; Fang, NF; Shi, ZH				Zeng, Yi; Fang, Nufang; Shi, Zhihua			Effects of human activities on soil organic carbon redistribution at an agricultural watershed scale on the Chinese Loess Plateau	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Human activity is thought to perturb the dynamic change of organic carbon (OC), but its impact on the transportation and redistribution of erosion-induced OC is still poorly understood. Here, we use mull-source field sampling data and long-term hydrological observation data to clarify the transportation and redistribution of OC in an agricultural watershed on the Loess Plateau. The endmember mixing model based on the radiocarbon isotopes (C-14) and a budget equation were used to assess the composition and budget of erosion-induced OC in a 187 km(2) watershed. The results showed that compared with the period of agricultural activities (1960 - 1969), soil conservation activities in 1970 - 1999 and 2000 - 2019 reduced soil erosion by 31.5 % and 75.4 %, respectively. Additionally, land use changes significantly reduced the mobilized OC, from 14,370 +/- 1966 (1960 -1969) to 3311 +/- 431 Mg C yr(-1) (2000 - 2019). Check dam construction led to the mobilized OC was effectively buried at a rate of 2125 +/- 478 and 1420 +/- 282 Mg C yr(-1) in periods of 1970-1999 and 2000-2019, respectively. Further radiocarbon isotopes analysis shows that the land use changes and check dam construction effectively reduced the output of ancient petrogenic organic carbon (OCpetro) and young biospheric organic carbon (OCbio) from the watershed, which has a positive impact on the regulation of atmospheric CO2 level. Our results emphasize the positive effects of soil conservation activities on terrestrial carbon sequestration, which are of great significance to clarify the effects of soil erosion on the carbon cycle.

Strategies for Effective Use of Genomic Information in Crop Breeding Programs Serving Africa and South Asia	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Much of the world's population growth will occur in regions where food insecurity is prevalent, with large increases in food demand projected in regions of Africa and South Asia. While improving food security in these regions will require a multi-faceted approach, improved performance of crop varieties in these regions will play a critical role. Current rates of genetic gain in breeding programs serving Africa and South Asia fall below rates achieved in other regions of the world. Given resource constraints, increased genetic gain in these regions cannot be achieved by simply expanding the size of breeding programs. New approaches to breeding are required. The Genomic Open-source Breeding informatics initiative (GOBii) and Excellence in Breeding Platform (EiB) are working with public sector breeding programs to build capacity, develop breeding strategies, and build breeding informatics capabilities to enable routine use of new technologies that can improve the efficiency of breeding programs and increase genetic gains. Simulations evaluating breeding strategies indicate cost-effective implementations of genomic selection (GS) are feasible using relatively small training sets, and proof-of-concept implementations have been validated in the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) maize breeding program. Progress on GOBii, EiB, and implementation of GS in CIMMYT and International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) breeding programs are discussed, as well as strategies for routine implementation of GS in breeding programs serving Africa and South Asia.

Currently, this plain is facing a dilemma between groundwater depletion and grain production demand. It is urgent to identify the impact of future climate change on crop yield and water consumption and then develop efficient adaptation strategies in the region. In this study, we used statistically downscaled daily climate data from 33 global climate models (GCMs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for 61 stations distributed across the NCP and drove the well-validated APSIM model to simulate crop yield and water use for two future periods of 2031-2060 (2040s) and 2071-2100 (2080s). Data from all 33 GCMs show an increase in annual mean temperature and almost all the GCMs also show increases in annual mean solar radiation and annual total precipitation across the NCP. Future climate warming led to an advance in phenology for both winter wheat and summer maize, two typical crops in the NCP. However, the length of the reproductive growth period (RGP) of winter wheat was prolonged while that of summer maize was shortened under future climate scenarios across the NCP. Our simulated results show that future climate change had negative impacts on maize yield but positive impacts on wheat yield across the NCP. Mainly due to the shortening of the whole growth period, crop water consumption was largely decreased under future climate scenarios. The amount of irrigation required was also reduced mainly due to increased precipitation and decreased ET. Although future climate change would likely mitigate groundwater overdraft in most part of NCP, some areas in the northern NCP still had groundwater over-pumping in the future. Therefore, we suggest that it might be a good choice to change cropping system for reducing planting area of water-consuming crop (e.g. winter wheat) in those over-pumping areas to balance groundwater use and crop yield.

Flow velocity on cultivated soil slope with wheat straw incorporation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Water flow velocity is of great importance in quantifying overland water flow hydrodynamics, related to rainfall infiltration, runoff energy, and soil erosion. Mixing the straw into the cultivated soil can change its physical properties and in turn affect the velocity of water flow. Laboratory investigations were made to measure the velocities of rainfall runoff water flow under four incorporation rates (0, 2, 4 and 8 ton/ha), three rainfall intensities (80, 120 and 160 mm/h) and three slope gradients (10, 15 and 20 degrees), on straw incorporation soil slopes, at slope distances of 5, 6 and 7 m from the top end of the slope, using an electrolyte tracing system. The results show that the flow velocity decreased exponentially with straw incorporation rate. The mean flow velocity ranged from 0.17 to 0.23 m/s over the bare soil slope, while the mean flow velocity ranged from 0.10 to 0.17 m/s, 0.09 to 0.13 m/s, and 0.06 to 0.11 m/s over the soil slopes with straw incorporation rates of 2, 4, 8 t/ha respectively. The 2, 4 and 8 t/ha straw incorporation rates reduced flow velocities by 28.44%, 44.09% and 55.56%, respectively. Higher rainfall intensity and slope gradient caused increase in flow velocity. There was no significant difference between the two adjacent rainfall intensities and slope gradients. A nonlinear multiple regression model was used to fit the measured velocities, which predicts well the effect of straw incorporation rate, rainfall intensity, and slope gradient. Increase in straw application rate had a good effect on reducing the flow velocity which may influence soil erosion and sediment delivery. Velocity over soil slope with straw incorporation can help interpret soil erosion and sediment transportation.					huaqing, liu/ABC-5155-2020	Liu, Huaqing/0000-0001-6651-9671													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2020	584								124667	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124667	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124667													WOS:000527390200047

Accurate estimation of hydraulic parameters is critical for soil erosion models. Hydraulic data for different levels of vegetation stem cover, slope gradient and flow discharge are quite limited. The objectives of this study were to compare different measured methods of flow velocity, evaluate the influence of vegetation stem cover, slope gradient and discharge on hydraulic parameters and predict the shear stress (tau), stream power (Omega) and unit stream power (omega) and emphasize the significance of hydraulic radius in the calculation of the shear stress (tau), stream power (Omega), and unit stream power (omega). A non-erodible flume bed was used in this study. The discharge ranged from 0.5 x 10(-3) to 2.0 x 10(-3) m(3) s(-1), the slope gradient ranged from 8.8% to 25.9%, and an artificial stem cover of approximately 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30% was used to represent the natural vegetation. The stems were 2 mm in diameter and randomly arranged. The electrolyte pulse method was preferred for measurement of the overland flow velocity. The flow velocity decreased as the stem cover increased, and flow discharge and slope gradient decreased. The reduction in flow velocity was as high as 90% for 30% stem cover based on the experiments. The flow depth increased as the stem cover and flow discharge increased as the slope gradient decreased. The Reynolds and Froude number values decreased with increasing stem cover. The shear stress, stream power and unit stream power were all significantly affected by the stem cover and could all broadly be described using an exponential delay function of the stem cover. The omega was no significantly impacted by hydraulic radius. Thus, the unit stream power is an improved hydraulic parameter for predicting sediment transport capacity.

Previous studies often used PNV patterns as a reference; however, they ignored PNV ecological functions, impeding the establishment of function-oriented vegetation protection and restoration plans. To address this issue, this study used Loess Plateau of China as a case study to propose an ecological function-oriented vegetation protection and restoration framework based on PNV patterns and ecological functions. The results showed that PNV patterns, ecological functions, and their synergistic and trade-off relationships represented distinct spatial differences that would be largely influenced by climate change. This suggested that vegetation protection and restoration should be adapted to climate change. The protection and potential restoration regions for actual forest and grass were detected based on the stable PNV regions. Approximately 34.5%-41.4% of actual forest and 81.2%-82.3% of actual grass should be protected. Further, 13.9%-16.2% of actual forest and 14.7%-15.2% of actual grass have the potential to be restored to grass and forest, respectively, and lastly, the priority regions of forest and grass protection and potential restoration were determined according to a composite ecological functions index. Moreover, forest protection should be prioritized, followed by forest potential restoration, grass potential restoration, and grass protection. These results would be conducive to forest and grass protection and restoration of the Loess Plateau. The proposed framework is applicable to other regions of the world for developing vegetation protection and restoration strategies.

However, the effects of the encroachment process on soil bacterial communities are poorly understood on the Loess Plateau, China. In this study, we assessed the changes in soil properties and vegetation characteristics, and their association with alterations in soil bacterial communities in grasslands subjected to different subshrub (Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb.) encroachment intensities (no subshrub encroachment, light subshrub encroachment, moderate subshrub encroachment, and heavy subshrub encroachment). Our results indicated that heavy subshrub encroachment significantly increased plant aboveground biomass and bacterial diversity, but adversely affected plant diversity. Heavy and moderate subshrub encroachment significantly increased soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and water content. Subshrub encroachment at all intensities increased community weighted mean trait values of leaf carbon content, leaf nitrogen content, leaf phosphorus content, specific leaf area, but decreased leaf dry matter content and community functional dispersion. In addition, subshrub encroachment altered the composition of plant and bacterial communities. The partial least squares structural equation model indicated that subshrub encroachment indirectly influenced bacterial communities by affecting vegetation characteristics and soil properties. The determinants of bacterial diversity were vegetation structures (community weighted mean trait values of specific leaf area and plant community composition) and soil properties (organic carbon content, alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen, total phosphorus, available phosphorus, and soil water content). The composition of bacterial community was primarily regulated by plant aboveground biomass and soil properties. Overall, the results of this study improved our understanding of the impact of subshrub encroachment on soil bacteria community on Loess Plateau, and the processes underlying the alterations in the soil bacterial community by subshrub encroachment.

However, there are conflicting conclusions regarding the quantification of such changes in the soil properties and plant diversity. Moreover, the relationships between soil properties and plant diversity are unclear. Here, a global meta-analysis was conducted on the impact of exotic species invasion on soil physicochemistry, microbial activity, and plant diversity using data from 123 published reports and 332 samples. Exotic species invasion significantly enhanced the soil pH, soil microbial activity, and soil nutrient content. The impact was more substantial for grass than for shrub and tree. Exotic species invasion did not significantly affect soil texture, but significantly reduced the plant diversity, richness, and evenness by 36.97%, 64.72%, and 47.21%, respectively. Soil pH, soil organic carbon, and total nitrogen were significantly correlated with plant diversity reduction. The response ratio of plant richness and evenness gradually increased with precipitation. However, the response ratio of phosphatase, microbial biomass nitrogen, microbial biomass phosphorus, total nitrogen, and soil moisture gradually decreased with precipitation. Overall, exotic species invasion significantly increased the soil nutrient content and soil microbial activity, but significantly decreased plant diversity. These effects were influenced by exotic species types and precipitation.

It is critical to understand the status of soil elements required for microbial growth, the elements of microbial growth, and how soil microorganisms would reallocate resources and release extracellular enzymes for adjusting the imbalance between resources and microorganisms due to N deposition. We chose a plantation of Pinus tabuliformis where N had been added across a gradient (0-9 g N m(-2) y(-1)) for two years to reveal how matters flow and soil resources were reallocated by microbes to cope N addition. Our results showed that although two years of N inputs only significantly affect the ratio between the activities of beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase and alkaline phosphatase in the 0-20 cm soil layer, activities for both organic N and organic phosphorus (P) acquisition enzymes scale with C acquisition with slope of about 1, following the global ecoenzymatic patterns. Contents and elemental ratios of soil organic carbon (SOC), total N (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were changed after this short-term N addition. Ratios of SMBC, SMBN and SMBP were concentrated from soil and lower than ratios of soil resources. Soil microbial communities under N addition were limited by N and co-limited by P at 3 and 6 g N m(-2) y(-1). Although imbalance between soil and microbes caused by N addition, in the 0-20 and 20-40 cm layers, C: N relationship between soil and the microbial community indicated microbial community maintained homeostasis. However, C:P relationship between soil and the microbial community indicated no microbial community homeostasis. In addition, both soil resources elemental stoichiometry and contents can affect soil microbial communities. Further study of the structure of soil microbial communities, identifying the microbes that are more adaptive to high N concentrations and N deposition, is needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms of nutrient flow in the food web and how to maintain microbial homeostasis in response to N deposition in forest ecosystems.					fang, li/JNS-8415-2023; Ai, Zemin/T-2463-2018	Ai, Zemin/0000-0002-0376-1468; Wang, Guoliang/0000-0003-4880-0333													0016-7061	1872-6259				MAR 1	2019	337						630	640		10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.10.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.10.017													WOS:000456761500062

This study aimed to investigate genotypic variation in root morphology and Cd accumulations under moderate Cd stress among diverse maize genotypes. Twenty maize genotypes with contrasting root systems were assessed for Cd tolerance 39 days after transplanting (V6, six-leaf stage) under 20 mu mol L-1 CdCl2 using a semi-hydroponic phenotyping platform in a glasshouse. RESULTS Cadmium stress significantly inhibited plant growth across all genotypes. Genotypic variation in response to Cd toxicity was apparent: shoot dry weight varied from 0.13 (genotype NS2020) to 0.35 g plant(-1) (Dongke301) with deductions up to 63% compared with non-Cd treatment (CK). Root dry weight of 20 genotypes ranged from 0.06 (NS2020) to 0.18 g plant(-1) (Dongke301) with a deduction up to 56%. Root length ranged from 2.21 (NS590b) to 9.22 m (Dongke301) with a maximal decline of 76%. Cadmium-treated genotypes generally had thicker roots and average diameter increased by 34% compared with CK. Genotypes had up to 3.25 and 3.50 times differences in shoot and root Cd concentrations, respectively. Principal component and cluster analyses assigned the 20 genotypes into Cd-tolerant (five genotypes) and Cd-sensitive (15 genotypes) groups. CONCLUSIONS Maize genotypes varied significantly in response to moderate Cd stress. Cadmium-tolerant genotypes optimized root morphology and Cd accumulation and distribution. This study could assist in the selection and breeding of new cultivars with improved adaptation to Cd-contaminated soil for food and feed or land remediation purposes. (c) 2022 The Authors.

J	Hao, WL; Xia, B; Xu, MX				Hao, Wanglin; Xia, Bin; Xu, Mingxiang			Erosion-deposition positively reconstruct the bacterial community and negatively weaken the fungal community	CATENA												Soil erosion and deposition are general ecological processes that have been widely described in terms of their effects on the physical and chemical properties of soil. However, their effects on soil microbes remain unclear, especially how microbial communities respond to erosion-deposition in soils with different organic carbon levels. A long-term field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of erosion and deposition on soil microbial communities across full slopes with different organic carbon levels on the Loess Plateau of China. The results showed that erosion reduced soil bacterial alpha diversity, weakened bacterial network complexity while deposition increased bacterial alpha diversity, and enhanced the complexity of the bacterial network. However, both erosion and deposition caused a decrease in fungal alpha diversity and network complexity. There was a weak reverse cooperative covariation relationship between bacterial and fungal alpha diversity. There was a higher bacterial and fungal diversity at the eroded and depositional sites with high soil organic carbon (SOC) level than low and medium SOC levels. An increase in the SOC level effectively strengthened the network complexity of bacteria and fungi at the eroded and depositional sites.. Erosion-deposition and SOC levels significantly increased variation in bacterial community structure. In contrast, the fungal community structure only differed at the eroded and depositional sites at high SOC levels. The key factors driving variation in bacterial community structure in soil properties were not significantly affected by SOC levels. Conversely, key factors resulting in differences in fungal community structure were regulated by the SOC level. Our results demonstrate that erosion-deposition reconstruct the bacterial community and weakens the fungal community, organic carbon regulate soil microbial communities and functions by controlling earth surface processes induced by erosion-deposition.

Impact of host sex and age on the diversity of endoparasites and structure of individual-based host-parasite networks in nyalas (<i>Tragelaphus angasii</i> Angas) from three game reserves in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												In recent years, numerous studies have examined the effect of host sex and age on the structure of parasite communities in several host taxa under various environmental conditions and in different geographic regions. However, the influence of such factors on the structure of host-parasite networks has received less attention, and remarkably few studies have been carried out on large terrestrial mammals. In this study, we investigated the effects of host age and sex on the parasite infra- and component communities of nyalas (Tragelaphus angasii) and on the structure of individual-based nyala-endoparasite networks. We also aimed to evaluate to what extent these effects vary spatially and if they are mediated by conservation management. Based on a data set of internal macroparasites of 74 nyalas from three game reserves in KwaZulu-Natal province, we found that host age strongly influenced parasite community structure as well as the structure of parasite-nyala networks, whereas host sex played a minor role. However, the effects of both host sex and age were mediated by environmental conditions and thus led to different patterns at the three localities. Our findings highlight that host-parasite communities from different localities should not be pooled when conducting host-parasite network and community studies as this may bias results and mask patterns that are typical for a given locality.																			0932-0113	1432-1955				NOV	2022	121	11					3249	3267		10.1007/s00436-022-07653-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-022-07653-x		SEP 2022						36071296					WOS:000850783100001

Two sources of zinc are commonly supplemented in animal feed, organic and inorganic zinc, and there are reports that the former is absorbed to a greater extent than the latter. We hypothesized that supplementary zinc would increase zinc content in eggs of laying hens and that organic zinc would be more effective than inorganic zinc. To test these hypotheses, we examined the effect of levels and sources of supplemental dietary zinc on average daily feed intake (ADFI), egg production, and zinc content in eggs and on serum antioxidant capacity and zinc concentration in laying hens. A total of 720 Roman laying hens (21-week-old) were randomly assigned to 5 treatment groups with 6 replicates, with 24 hens in each replicate. Two sources of zinc, organic (zinc amino acid complex) and inorganic (zinc sulfate), each with 2 levels, low (35 mg/kg) and high (70 mg/kg), comprised 4 treatment groups, and a control group without supplementary zinc was the fifth group. Seven days were allowed for adjustment to the conditions, and then measurements were taken over 42D. There was no difference inADFI, average egg weight (EW), ADFI-to-EW ratio, and egg quality (P > 0.05) among the = treatment groups; supplemental zinc increased serum concentrations of Zn2+ and Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase and tended to increase superoxide dismutase content (P = 0.065). Zinc content in eggs increased linearly with supplementary organic zinc (N = 18, R-2 = 0.363, P = 0.008) and with supplementary inorganic zinc (N=18, R-2=0.366, P=0.008) treatment, but there was no difference between the source treatments of zinc. Therefore, our first hypothesis was supported, but our second one was not supported. We concluded that zinc supplementation is effective in enhancing zinc content in eggs and in improving antioxidant capacity in laying hens.

Three regions of contrasting climate: highland, midland, and lowland regions with respectively high, middle, and low elevations and rainfalls. Study focus: Lag time (T-L) and time of concentration (T-C) are two measures of how quickly a stream responds to runoff-producing rainfall. These parameters are the main inputs used to estimate peak flow under flood conditions in ungauged watersheds. Many empirical methods have been proposed to estimate T-L and T-C, but the validity of none of them has been tested. This study compared 10 commonly used methods by using measured T-L and T-C. New hydrological insights: Measured median values of TL and T-C for 176 rainfall-runoff events were used to evaluate the performance of empirical methods. For individual watersheds, the estimates of T-L and T-C differed by up to 2.6 h and 4.4 h, respectively. Most of the empirical methods tended to substantially underestimate T-L and T-C, which would lead to overestimation of runoff volume. T-L and T-C computed by two methods that consider both overland and channel flow were closest to the measured values of T-L and T-C, because such mixed flow is typical of tropical climate regions. Our results show the need for caution when empirical methods developed in regions with a particular climatic and geomorphological conditions are applied elsewhere.

J	Liu, N; Ding, YX; Peng, SZ				Liu, Ning; Ding, Yongxia; Peng, Shouzhang			Temporal effects of climate on vegetation trigger the response biases of vegetation to human activities	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Quantitatively distinguishing the effects of human activities and climate change on vegetation change is crucial for planning scientific vegetation management measures. Previous studies have employed the residual trend method (RESTREND) and remote sensing data to address this issue. However, the mathematical relationships between climate and remote sensing vegetation index under RESTREND are variable and not comprehensively described due to temporal effects of climate on vegetation. Using Tibetan Plateau (TP), this study investigated how the temporal effects of climate on vegetation trigger response biases of vegetation to human activities under four temporal effects (no temporal effect [No], temporal lag effect [Lag], temporal accumulation effect [Acc], and both temporal lag and temporal accumulation effects [Lagacc]). The results revealed the following. (1) The mean explanation degrees of climatic factors to vegetation growth over entire TP under No, Lag, Acc, and Lagacc effects were 0.41 +/- 0.02, 0.42 +/- 0.02, 0.44 +/- 0.02, and 0.47 +/- 0.02, respectively. Therefore, the Lagacc effect is the best temporal effect for establishing the vegetation-climate relationships. (2) Under the Lagacc effect, the temperature exhibited 1.60 +/- 0.13 months lag and 4.56 +/- 0.28 months accumulation on vegetation growth over entire the TP, whereas the precipitation exhibited 1.57 +/- 0.16 months lag and 4.99 +/- 0.31 months accumulation. Furthermore, the grids affected by the combined temporal lag and temporal accumulation effects of climatic factors accounted for 43.42-45.78% of the total grids. These indicated the temporal effects of climate on vegetation, and vegetation growth was largely affected by the combined temporal effects of climatic factors. (3) Under the Lagacc effect, 11.6% of the region experienced significant residual increase, and the slope of the residual was 22.2 x 10(-4), which was primarily distributed in the north and southeast of the TP. However, the area and slope of significant residual decrease were 1.3% and 24.0 x 10(-4), respectively, which were primarily distributed in the center of the TP. Furthermore, the average contributions of human activities on vegetation growth in the regions of residual significant increase and decrease were 54.5% and 55.5%, respectively. Therefore, the Lagacc effect exhibited the smallest influence area and the lowest influence degree for the contribution of human activities on vegetation growth. We thus suggest that the Lagacc effect should be fully considered when establishing the mathematical relationship between climatic factors and the vegetation index.																				2351-9894				NOV	2021	31								e01827	10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01822	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01822													WOS:000697669600001
J	Jia, YH; Li, TC; Shao, MA				Jia, Yu-Hua; Li, Tong-Chuan; Shao, Ming-An			A preliminary investigation of gully edge effect on the distribution pattern of soil moisture across a permanent gully	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Describing and mapping soil water content (SWC) distribution are required to understand and explain the hydrological phenomena at various spatial scales. Soil drought in the hilly and gully regions of Loess Plateau reduces agricultural production and plants biomass, which has attracted great attention but few studies associated it with the gullied terrain. To understand the SWC distribution pattern in the slope-gully system, we established a cross-section transect for SWC observation across a permanent gully and acquired 23 occasions of SWC data in the periods from October 2014 to September 2018. The standardized beta coefficient in stepwise multiple linear regression was employed to determine the strength of the effect of the selected variables (soil textural separates, soil depth, relative height, distance to the gully and saturated hydraulic conductivity) on SWS distribution. Spectral and cross-spectral analysis were performed on the time series of SWC to evaluate the cyclical behavior and the similarity for adjacent sites, respectively. The following results were obtained: First, the SWC distribution had a bilateral asymmetrical pattern across the gully, which constituted a specific and detailed content of spatial variability of SWC. Second, soil water storage in the slope-gully system was primarily affected by soil texture, meanwhile, the effect of distance to the gully was stronger than that of soil depth. Third, the SWC of the adjacent pair sites presented consistent periodic behavior. The cross-spectral analysis indicated a dissimilar pattern for soil layer of 0-60 cm and deep synchrony for the other depth layers. In conclusion, the gully edge effect aggravated the SWC status in the south bank and caused a bilateral asymmetrical pattern in the slope-gully system. These results improved our knowledge on the complicated distribution of SWC in the gullied region. Moreover, the results indicate that ignoring the nearby areas of a permanent gully in a catchment is inappropriate when investigating soil water resources.

J	Liu, J; Liu, HH				Liu, Jing; Liu, Honghu			Soil erosion changes during the last 30 years and contributions of gully erosion to sediment yield in a small catchment, southern China	GEOMORPHOLOGY												As a large weathered granite soil region in the world, southern China is experiencing severe sheet and rill erosion and gully erosion due to its special geological conditions, inappropriate land use, and high intensity precipitation. However, few studies have been conducted on the long-term dynamics of these two types of soil erosion and the sediment contribution of gully erosion in southern China. To assess this, estimates of soil erosion changes and the contribution ratio of gully erosion to sediment yield in a small catchment in southern China from 1989 to 2015 are quantified. A topographic map and three high-resolution satellite images were interpreted for land use changes to calculate soil erosion modulus of sheet and rill erosion by the Chinese soil loss equation (CSLE) and to estimate the amount of gully erosion by gully volume based on a generalized inverted triangular pyramid model multiplying bulk density. Results indicated that soil erosion modulus started as high as 10,442 t km(-2) in 1989, followed by an initial decrease of 54% before increasing slightly. The total gully volume decreased by 37% overall, as did the cumulative amount of gully erosion. Between 2005 and 2010 positive total soil loss was calculated and the sediment contribution ratio of gully erosion was estimated to be 52.27%. It can be concluded that the combination of remote sensing images, the CSLE, and a new generalized gully model can effectively be used to quantify soil loss from sheet and rill erosion as well as gully erosion. This study provides a new insight to estimate gully erosion and the dynamic evolution of soil loss. Further studies should be performed in combination with field methods to validate this approach.

This study investigated the qualitative and quantitative estimation of phytochemicals present in Ficus platyphylla stem bark as well as determined the reducing power and antioxidant property of each fraction against DPPH and NO radicals. The study further elucidated the presence of possible compounds in different fractions (methanol, ethyl acetate, petroleum ether, and chloroform) of Ficus platyphylla stem bark (FPSB) extract using GC-MS, LC-MS, and FTIR techniques. Qualitative phytochemical analysis reveals the presence of phytochemicals: saponin, flavonoids, tannins, phenols, steroids, alkaloids, and glycoside in the ethanolic extract. The LC-MS study of methanol and ethyl acetate fractions reveals the presence of thirteen and three compounds, respectively. GC-MS analysis shows the presence of trans-13-octadecenoic acid as the main compound 38.07% and cis-vaccenic acid as the least compound (0.10%) in the petroleum ether fraction. The main compound in the chloroform fraction is 12-oleanen-3-yl acetate, (3. alpha.) with a peak area percentage of 49.25% and oleic acid been the least compound with 0.07% peak area. The FTIR analysis reveals that the fractions contain compounds with hydroxyl, aromatic, methyl, methylene, methyne, long aliphatic chain, ethers, ether-oxy, peroxides, etc. The analyzed fractions reveal compounds with potential pharmacological activity in the management of pathological conditions.

The analysis of soil properties in the laboratory using standard procedures is time-consuming and requires the use of chemicals. The research aimed to develop a regression model based on the visible-near-infrared-short-wave infrared (Vis-NIR-SWIR, 0.35-2.5 mu m) spectral re-flectance of soils in Aba Gerima (425 ha), a highland of the Ethiopian Nile Basin. Soil samples were obtained at a 0-20 cm depth from 101 plots in the study area and analyzed for soil organic carbon (SOC) and texture using standard laboratory procedures. Soil reflectance was measured using a spectroradiometer on the air-dried, ground, and sieved soils. ArcGIS software 10.5 was used to conduct the semi-variogram and geostatistical methods-Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Least Distance Weighting (IDW). Strong degrees of spatial dependence are depicted through semi-variogram models. This outcome illustrates a strong spatial dependence and continuity be-tween nearby soil samples. The prediction accuracy of the model based on the values of coeffi-cient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) was explained. For clay content, the R2 and RMSE obtained in the Vis-NIR-SWIR were excellent (0.91) and 2.93. An R2 of 0.85 with an RMSE of 1.96 was obtained in predicting sand. The SOC model established indicated an R2 of 0.94 and an RMSEC of 0.01. The generated maps showed that the soil characteristics' spatial variability was adequate to forecast the values of soil fertility indicators in the research area and nearby regions. The soil maps may assist farmers and policymakers in identifying soil nutrient status, improving soil management strategies, rising crop productivity, and guaranteeing ecologi-cal integrity. Moreover, further study is required to corroborate our findings and improve the pre-diction performance of Vis-NIR-SWIR spectroscopy to help better land management interven-tions.

Herein, the effect of 28 KHz ultrasound treatment for 20, 40 and 60 min and 1.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for 20 min was assessed for the decontamination of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) seeds. In addition, seed germination indices, seedling growth traits, total phenolic content and the activity of defenserelated enzymes, viz. peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase and malondialdehyde were measured in the treated seeds. An isolate of Fusarium solani was obtained from roselle seeds and identified as the causal agent of roselle seed rot based on morphological and molecular characteristics. After six days of seed storage, the microbial infection caused the highest seed rot in the control seeds on the average of 56.67%, whereas ultrasound treatment for 60 min could remarkably reduce the seed decay by 3.33%. At the end of seed storage, the fungal load showed the highest (7.72 Log CFU ml- 1) and lowest (6.99 Log CFU ml- 1) rates in the control and ultrasound treatment for 60 min, respectively. Total phenolic content was significantly increased in ultrasound treatment for 60 min compared to control and sodium hypochlorite treatments. Moreover, the activity of peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase was noticeably improved in ultrasound treatment for 60 min. Furthermore, ultrasound treatment did not show any adverse effects on seed germination indices and seedling growth traits of the roselle plants. Overall, ultrasound treatment for 60 min could effectively decrease roselle seed decay and the fungal load without changing seed and seedling quality.

J	Liu, X; Xu, YY				Liu, Xian; Xu, Yueyue			Effect of integration of water and fertilizer on soil water-nitrogen transport characteristics in Bubbled-root Irrigation	IRRIGATION SCIENCE												Improving water and fertilizer use efficiency in arid and semi-arid regions can not only promote the sustainable development of regional crop production, but also effectively meet the challenges of future global water shortage and food security. Bubbled-root irrigation is a new water-saving irrigation technology developed for arid and semi-arid areas. It not only has the characteristics of precision irrigation (improving water and fertilizer utilization and irrigation efficiency), but also has the advantage of not being easily blocked. In this study, the infiltration capacity, wetting front transport characteristics, water and nitrogen transport, and transformation characteristics of Bubbled-root Irrigation under water and fertilizer coupling conditions were investigated in the arid region of Northwest China. The results showed that under the same infiltration time, the higher the fertilizer concentration, the greater the cumulative infiltration and wetting front (horizontal, vertical upward, and vertical downward wetting front) transport distance. Based on the results, a mathematical model with cumulative infiltration or wetting front as the dependent variable, fertilizer concentration and infiltration time as independent variables was constructed. The model has high reliability (The relative deviation between the fitted value and the measured value is within +/- 10%), and can be used to guide the layout of emitters in the field and crop production. Under the same infiltration time, the higher the fertilizer concentration, the higher the content of water, ammonium nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen in the same soil node. For example, the soil water content of C = 12, 35, 60 g L-1 was 8.35%, 14.37%, 23.31% higher than that of C = 0 g L-1 at 10 cm horizontal and 40 cm vertical to the emitter. At the soil depth of 40 cm, the soil mass water content is 21.46%, 17.06%, 15.50%, and 10.37% at the end of irrigation and 1, 3, and 5 d of redistribution. The contents of ammonium nitrogen in soil are 228.13, 215.43, 183.16, and 116.43 mg kg(-1) at the end of irrigation, 3, 5, and 10 d of redistribution, respectively. Redistribution of 5-10 d, soil NH4+ N content decreased significantly. Distribution of 1-10 d, soil NO3- N content showed varying degrees of increase. The research results are helpful to promote the application of spring root irrigation in the world, improve the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer, and provide a new way to alleviate the pressure of water resources and food security.																			0342-7188	1432-1319				MAY	2023	41	3					379	393		10.1007/s00271-023-00851-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00271-023-00851-0		FEB 2023											WOS:000939569400001

Revegetation could reduce carbon emission by controlling soil erosion and increase carbon sequestration and accumulation by fixing carbon in vegetation and soil. The Grain for Green Program (GFGP) of China is the largest ecological restoration program in the world closely related to land-use/land-cover change (LUCC). Systematically assessing the carbon sequestration benefit of GFGP is crucial for a better understanding of the effects of implementing GFGP and providing reasonable vegetation management. Therefore, we selected the hilly red soil region (HRSR) of southern China as a study area, which is one of the main ecologically vulnerable areas in China. We assessed the carbon sequestration in the GFGP area of the HRSR using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs) model based on land-use/land-cover datasets during 2000-2015. Our results show that implementing GFGP is conducive to the enhancement of carbon sequestration services. Total carbon sequestration showed an increasing trend at a rate of 15.43% from 2000 to 2015. The most significant change mainly happened in Hunan Province with the shortest implementation time. The carbon sequestration of each carbon pool (namely aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil, and dead organic matter) also increased slightly. Additionally, for carbon sequestration, unused land converted to forest land is the most effective LUCC. This study can provide scientific support for the management and implementation of GFGP in the HRSR of China.

However, relationships between household food insecurity indicators and dietary diversity and nutritional status of reproductive age mothers and their young children are unclear. A longitudinal study was conducted among 800 farming households in lowland and midland agro-ecological zones of rural Ethiopia in pre and post-harvest seasons. A structured interview, which included measures of three food access indicators - household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS), household dietary diversity score (HDDS) and household food consumption score (HFCS)-was conducted. Additionally, a subset of 183 households was selected for assessment of indicators of nutritional status including maternal and child dietary diversity and anthropometric measurements for children 6-23months of age. Magnitudes of household food insecurity indices were high by international standards, particularly during the lean season (pre-harvest). Using correlation, Chi square and multivariable regression models, HFCS in both seasons was related to maternal body mass index and haemoglobin, and weight-for-length of their children. HDDS was associated in the post-harvest season with haemoglobin level of the mothers, and weight-for-length of their children. HFCS was a better predictor of nutritional status of mothers and children in both the food surplus and lean seasons, while HDDS was a better predictor of maternal and child nutritional status post-harvest. It is recommended that nutritional interventions should therefore focus on household food insecurity as well as targeting the individual nutritional status of mothers and children.

However, changes in soil microbial activity and their linkages with soil C under global warming remain unclear. Here, a global meta-analysis of 1272 pairwise observations was conducted to explore the effects of warming on soil microbial activity and their linkages with soil C under different warming duration (0-5, 5-10, and > 10 yr), warming magnitudes (<2 and >= 2 degrees C), ecosystem types (cropland, grassland, shrub, and forest), mean annual precipitation (MAP: 0-400, 400-800, and > 800 mm), and mean annual temperature (MAT: 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and > 20 degrees C). Warming overall positively affected soil microbial C, bacteria diversity, fungi richness, and soil C content. Moreover, the positive effects of warming on microbial and soil C gradually weakened and even inhibited with increasing warming duration and magnitudes. Additionally, the soil microbial biomass and microbial diversity shifted from positive to negative relationships with increasing MAP and MAT. Warming mainly affected soil microbial biomass and bacteria diversity in grasslands. Finally, warming induced significant linear relationships of microbial variables with soil C. In conclusion, our results indicated that warming had significant influences on soil microbial activity and soil C cycling, depending on warming duration, magnitudes, ecosystem types, MAP, and MAT. Such findings underscore the important effects of warming on soil C cycling in global ecosystems, which may improve our ability to predict soil biogeochemical cycles in this biome.

The composition of species and their ecological interactions within a community may vary greatly over time. Although intra-annual variations are often studied, empirical information on how plant-bird relationships are structured within and among years, and how their drivers may change over time are still limited. In this study, we analyzed the temporal dynamics of the structure of plant-hummingbird interaction networks by evaluating changes in species richness, diversity of interactions, modularity, network specialization, nestedness, and beta-diversity of interactions throughout four years in a Mexican xeric shrubland landscape. We also evaluated if the relative importance of abundance, phenology, morphology, and nectar sugar content consistently explains the frequency of pairwise interactions between plants and hummingbirds across different years. We found that species richness, diversity of interactions, nestedness, and network specialization did vary within and among years. We also observed that the beta-diversity of interactions was high among years and was mostly associated with species turnover (i.e., changes in species composition), with a minor contribution of interaction rewiring (i.e., shifting partner species at different times). Finally, the temporal co-occurrence of hummingbird and plant species among months was the best predictor of the frequency of pairwise interactions, and this pattern was consistent within and among years. Our study underscores the importance of considering the temporal scale to understand how changes in species phenologies, and the resulting temporal co-occurrences influence the structure of interaction networks.

Thus, to clarify the mechanisms involved, we measured the soil OC and total N (TN) concentrations and stocks in the 0-100 cm soil layer in adjacent grassland, farmland, and woodland at five sites on the Loess Plateau in China, which varied in terms of the mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT). The farmland or woodland was converted from grassland at each site. Conversion of grassland to farmland significantly reduced the soil OC and TN, with greater decreases in sites with relatively lower MAP and MAT (-0.60 Mg OC ha(-1 )yr(-1) and -0.22 Mg TN ha(-1 )yr(-1), respectively) than sites with relatively higher MAP and MAT (-0.35 Mg OC ha(-1 )yr(-1) and -0.04 Mg TN ha(-1 )yr(-1)). Conversion of grassland to woodland increased OC and TN at sites with higher MAP and MAT, but decreased them at sites with lower MAP and MAT. OC and TN increased to a depth of 100 cm with MAP and MAT after this land-use change. OC and TN decreased at relatively drier and colder sites, but increased at relatively wetter and warmer sites. These findings provide insights into the effects of land-use changes on the soil OC and TN under different climate conditions, thereby facilitating the sustainable management of grasslands in semiarid regions.

However, these dynamics have received little attention so far due to the lack of an approach separating them. In this study, we determined the natural abundance of C-13 and N-15 in soils from afforested forestlands and adjacent croplands, the forestlands were established at different times (10, 20 and 30 years) at four sites with different soil textures across the Loess Plateau of China. The objective was to explore the changes of new- and old- OC and N along with soil clay gradient, and to examine the proportions of these changes in total OC and N along with the clay content. We showed that the conversion of cropland to forestland increased total- and new- OC and N stocks by 0.69 kg m(-2) and 0.10 kg m(-2), but decreased old OC and N stocks by 0.20 kg m(-2) and 0.04 kg m(-2), respectively. When averaged across afforestation age, the proportions of new OC and N increased, but the proportions of old OC and N decreased with the clay content. In the soils that have a higher clay content, the accumulation of N rates were greater than that of OC in the new stock, and the loss rates of N were higher than that of OC in the old stock after afforestation. In contrast, in the soils that have a lower clay content, the accumulation rates of N were lower than that of OC in the new stock, and the loss rates of N were smaller than the loss of OC in the old stock. These findings indicated that soil texture regulates the changes of OC and N in new and old soil organic matter pools following cropland afforestation.

Potassium isotherm partitioning based on modified quantity-intensity relation and potassium buffering characterization of soils of North India	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE												Background: Potassium (K) availability in soil and plant uptake is restrained by the dynamic interactions among the different pools of K. Aims: To understand these interactions, a study was undertaken to assess the quantity-intensity (Q/I) and buffering characteristics of rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) growing soils. Ten contrasting soils were evaluated for K partitioning changes in exchangeable K (Delta EK) and non-exchangeable K (Delta NEK) pools in the soil-solution phase and buffering characteristics using a modified version of Q/I approach. Results: The partitioned Q/I isotherms showed strong adsorption with the increase in K concentration ratio (CRK) and the changes due to Delta EK were higher than changes due to Delta NEK. Total buffering capacity (PBCK) significantly correlated (r = 0.92, p <0.01) with clay content with a major share contributed by buffering capacity owing to non-exchangeable K ( PBC Delta NEK K ) rather than exchangeable K ( PBC Delta EK K ). The fixation capacity (beta) factor, the magnitude of added K converted into a non-exchangeable pool, ranged from 41 to 63%, whereas release (alpha) factor, the magnitude of added K converted to the exchangeable pool, ranged from 19 to 36%. Both threshold solution K (CKr) and threshold exchangeable K (EKr) values were found to be high in Satran clay loam (S2) and lower in Doon silty clay loam (S3) soils. The equilibrium exchangeable K (EKo) was found close to minimum exchangeable K (E-min) in Doon silty clay loam (S3) and Babaweyl sandy clay loam (S1) soils and overall E-min constituted about 8.94 to 0.57% of the EKo. Conclusion: It may be concluded that K Q/I isotherm partitioning provides a valuable insight to assess the dynamic relations. The ratio of alpha/beta (K recharge index) could be used to evaluate the K enrichment capacity of soil to K additions while EKr and E-min can be potentially useful in the elucidation of exchangeable K as K fertility index especially in soils with poor K fertilizer management.

Crop-livestock systems transformation in the semiarid zones of North Africa over a decade: approach and case-study in Southern Tunisia	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												Understanding and representing the transformation of agricultural production systems has attracted increasing interest due to its importance for identifying drivers of changes and coping mechanisms in response to global challenges. These challenges are all the most pressing in North African countries exposed to a dramatic reduction in rainfall and increasing temperatures that affect sustainability in more than half of this semi-arid territory. This paper describes an improved way to understand such transformations through a cross-cutting analysis of crop-livestock system indicators over a period of 10 years in one community in Southern Tunisia. Our methodology is divided into four steps: (i) systems identification, (ii) indicator-based assessment of system crop-livestock sustainability, (iii) hierarchical clustering to identify sustainable intensification (SI)-based farm types and, finally, (iv) analysis of trajectories of these farm types. Results showed that the sustainability of the systems studied increasingly depends on diversification rather than intensification, which dominated in the 2000s. However, diversification has not necessarily improved socio-economic viability. Over the 10-year period, results revealed a dramatic increase of almost 50% in the population of small-scale farms whose viability depends on a range of on- and off-farm activities to meet the short-term needs that correspond to a buffer strategy. Additionally, the dominant SI processes were shown to be mostly based on diversification to livestock activities with both milking and fattening. Our holistic and timeline approach to system transformation makes it possible to account for sustainability between (systems) generations, which will be highly needed in future discussions about sustainability.

Abundant and rare sub-communities are the integral components in driving SCCF. However, changes in abundant and rare sub-communities, as well as their contributions to SCCF, remain unclear in the eroded ecosystems. In this study, changes in abundant and rare sub-communities and their correlations with SCCF were comparatively explored with respect to soil erosion and deposition in the Loess Plateau. The alpha-diversity of rare sub-communities in the depositional zones was 4% higher than that in the eroding slopes, but there was no significant difference in alpha-diversity of abundant sub-communities between the eroding slopes and depositional zones. The compositions of abundant and rare sub-communities differed between the eroding slopes and depositional zones. Regarding the co-occurrence network of the eroded ecosystems, abundant subcommunities compared with rare sub-communities presented a higher degree and betweenness centrality; however, rare sub-communities possessed more frequent interactions with other species than abundant subcommunities, especially positive interactions. The alpha-diversity of abundant and rare sub-communities in ecological clusters showed positive links with SCCF. The link between alpha-diversity of abundant sub-communities and SCCF was weaker than that with rare sub-communities, which was related to the significant disparity in the abundance of functional genes involved in SCCF and the extent of functional redundancy between abundant and rare sub-communities in the eroded ecosystems. The functional difference of abundant and rare sub-communities in improving SCCF under soil erosion and deposition, is important for accurately assessing the effects of microbial communities on soil organic carbon pool in regions predominated with fragmented eroded landscapes.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2024	235								107675	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107675	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107675		NOV 2023											WOS:001116042400001

This study investigates the potential impacts of climate change on crop failure, grain yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) for both winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) in northern China, using the SPACSYS model. The model was calibrated and validated with datasets from 20-year long-term experiments (1985-2004) for the Loess plateau, and then used to forecast production (2020-2049) under six sharing social-economic pathway climate scenarios for both wheat and maize crops with irrigation. Results suggested that warmer climatic scenarios might be favourable for reducing the crop failure rate and increasing the grain yield for winter wheat, while the same climatic scenarios were unfavourable for maize production in the region. Furthermore, future SOC stocks in the topsoil layer (0-30 cm) could increase but in the subsoil layer (30-100 cm) could decrease, regardless of the chosen crop.

Similarity in ixodid tick communities harboured by wildlife and livestock in the Albany Thicket Biome of South Africa	PARASITOLOGY												South Africa has a diverse fauna of ixodid tick species, several of which are of medical or veterinary importance. Elucidation of which host or environmental characteristics determine the composition and abundance of tick assemblages is, therefore, highly relevant to disease management and wildlife conservation efforts. Here, we analysed the similarity in ixodid tick assemblages of three wildlife and three livestock species in a natural (Great Fish River Reserve) and anthropogenic (an adjacent farm) habitat in South Africa. We compared tick infracommunities of three wild host species between the reserve and the farm; of three wild host species within the reserve and of wild and livestock species on the farm (considering body size). Hosts examined in this study harboured the adults and immature stages of 11 tick species belonging to five ixodid genera. Notably, several tick species of South African wildlife have successfully made the switch to livestock and thus both wild hosts and livestock now contribute to the pool of maintenance hosts for these ticks as well as their associated pathogens. This is an important consideration when translocating wildlife or livestock as part of farming or conservation activities.																			0031-1820	1469-8161				APR	2022	149	5					667	674		10.1017/S0031182022000129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182022000129		FEB 2022						35115071					WOS:000759210000001

Grown in North India	AGRONOMY-BASEL												A field experiment on green pea (Pisum Sativum L.) was conducted under drip irrigation to determine the irrigation schedule based on real-time soil moisture measurements with irrigation treatments (main plots) and fertilizer treatments (sub-plots) in a split-plot design with three replications. Main plots consisted of fourirrigation levels at different matric potential ranges (I-1: -20 kPa; I-2: -30 kPa; I-3: -35 kPa; and I-4: -40 kPa), while the sub-plots consisted of three fertigation levels (F-1: 120%, F-2: 100% and F-3: 80%) of recommended dose of fertilizers (40:60:50 kg/ha of NPK). The tensiometer with digital pressure transducer transferred the soil matric potential data to the irrigation controller, which activated the solenoid valves for irrigation. Observations were collected on plant growth parameters, pod yield, and quality parameters. Descriptive statistics of different plant growth parameters were made. The higher SMP threshold (-20 kPa) and lower SMP threshold (-40 kPa) greatly reduced the yield and water-use efficiency. Considering the results, real-time soil moisture-based irrigation at the soil matric potential threshold level of -30 kPa with 120% of recommended dose of fertilizers through fertigation was recommended for attaining maximum green pea pod yield and water-use efficiency under semi-arid Inceptisols.

While its leaf extracts have been shown to inhibit the growth of some cancer cells, there is little information supporting the constituents' anti tumour potential. This study, therefore, investigated the effects of the plant's leaf extracts on cancer cells and the associated cellular/molecular mechanisms. Extracts were prepared using hexane (PBH), chloroform (PBC), ethyl acetate (PBE) and methanol (PBM) and constituents were identified by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Their cytotoxic effects on human cervical (HeLa) and lung cancer (MRC5-SV2) cells were assessed using the MTT and LDH release assays. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) and mitochondrial membrane potential by staining with JC-1 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide). Caspase activation was determined using a Caspase-Glo-3/7 assay, and DNA damage by the Comet assay. Changes to mRNA expression were assessed using Quantitative Real-Time PCR. PBC, PBE and PBM reduced cell viability and induced LDH release, with IC50 values (48 h, MTT, in mu g/ml), respectively, of 6.21 +/- 0.70, 23.39 +/- 3.92, and 22.43 +/- 3.58 (HeLa); and 1.98 +/- 0.33, 8.57 +/- 1.91 and 28.24 +/- 5.57 (MRC5-SV2). PBC induced ROS, while PBC, PBE and PBM impaired mitochondrial membrane potential and induced caspase 3/7 activation. PBC and PBE induced DNA damage, and PBE induced caspase-3 mRNA expression. Constituents of the extracts included derivatives of gallic acid, di peptides, diterpenoids and flavones. We conclude that P. bicalyculata contains cytotoxic principles that could be potential leads for developing novel anti-cancer agents.

It was found that PM2.5 emissions showed a decreasing trend year by year, and that the annual total emission of PM2.5 decreased by 28.5% in 2016 compared with that of 2013. When comparing the observation data of PM2.5 and ozone (O-3), it was found that both PM2.5 and O-3 show obvious seasonal changes. The emission of PM2.5 in autumn and winter is higher than that in summer, while that of O-3 is not. Our study showed that in the 2015-2020 period, annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 and O-3 in Beijing varied from 80.87 to 38.31 mu g m(-3) and 110.75 to 106.18 mu g m(-3), respectively. Since 2015, the observed value of PM2.5 has shown an obvious downward trend. Compared with 2015, the average annual PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing, Shanghai, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, and Hefei in 2020 had decreased by 52.62%, 40.35%, 22.2%, 46.84%, and 45.11%, respectively, while O-3 showed an upward trend. Compared with the annual averages of 2015 and 2020, Beijing and Shanghai saw a decrease of 4.13% and 8.46%, respectively, while Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, and Hefei saw an increase of 7.08%, 19.46%, and 41.57%, respectively. The comparison shows that PM2.5 is becoming less threatening in China and that ozone is becoming more difficult to control. Air pollution is a modifiable risk factor. Appropriate sustainable control policies are recommended to protect public health.																				2073-4433				JAN	2022	13	1							104	10.3390/atmos13010104	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13010104													WOS:000757047100001

This study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in ET0 in China and to improve the accuracy of ET0 calculations on different spatiotemporal scales. Meteorological data collected at 100 stations in China during 1961 to 2019 were used to calculate ET0 with the Penman-Monteith model, and the temporal and spatial patterns in ET0-PM were analyzed with the Mann-Kendall nonparametric trend test method. Three machine learning models comprising convolutional neural network (CNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and multiple adaptive regression splines (MARS), and seven empirical models calibrated with mind evolutionary algorithm (MEA) were compared to assess their suitability for calculating ET0 on different spatiotemporal scales in China. The results showed that the annual mean ET0-PM value (413.29-2772.35 mm) in China gradually increased from north to south and from west to east. ET0 exhibited an upward trend in the temperate continental zone (TCZ) and mountain plateau zone (MPZ) but a downward trend in the temperate monsoon zone (TMZ) and subtropical monsoon region (SMZ). By comparing the global performance indicators (GPI), the machine learning models generally performed better than the empirical models at different spatiotemporal scales. And CNN was the best model for calculating ET0 in terms of the model accuracy and stability. On the daily scale, MARS performed well in MPZ, whereas ELM performed well in TMZ and TCZ. On the monthly scale, MARS performed well in TMZ, whereas ELM performed well in SMZ and MPZ. At the annual scale, the accuracy of ELM was higher than that of MARS.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				JAN	2022	604								127207	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127207		DEC 2021											WOS:000731346400003
J	Rahma, AE; Warrington, DN; Lei, TW				Rahma, Abbas E.; Warrington, David N.; Lei, Tingwu			Efficiency of wheat straw mulching in reducing soil and water losses from three typical soils of the Loess Plateau, China	INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Mulching the soil surface with a layer of plant residue is considered an effective method of conserving water and soil because it increases water infiltration into the soil, reduces surface runoff and the soil erosion, and reduces flow velocity and the sediment carrying capacity of overland flow. However, application of plant residues increases operational costs and so optimal levels of mulch in order to prevent soil and/or water losses should be used according to the soil type and rainfall and slope conditions. In this study, the effect of wheat straw mulch rate on the total runoff and total soil losses from 60-mm simulated rainstorms was assessed for two intensive rainfalls (90 and 180 mm h(-1)) on three slope gradients typical conditions on the Loess Plateau of China and elsewhere. For short slopes (1 m), the optimal mulch rate to save water for a silt loam and a loam soil was 0.4 kg m(-2). However, for a clay loam soil the mulch rate of 0.4 kg m(-2) would be optimal only under the 90 mm h(-1) rainfall; 0.8 kg m(-2) was required for the 180 mm h(-1). In order to save soil, a mulch rate of 0.2 kg m(-2) on the silt loam slopes prevented 60%-80% of the soil losses. For the loam soil, mulch at the rate of 0.4 kg m(-2) was essential in most cases in order to reduce soil losses substantially. For the clay loam, 0.4 kg m(-2) may be optimal under the 90 mm h(-1) rain, but 0.8 kg m(-2) may be required for the 180 mm h(-1) rainstorm. These optimal values would also need to be considered alongside other factors since the mulch may have value if used elsewhere. Hence doubling the optimal mulch rate for the silt loam soil from 0.2 kg m(-2) or the clay loam soil under 90 mm h(-1) rainfall from 0.4 kg m(-2) in order to achieve a further 10% reduction in soil loss needs to be assessed in that context. Therefore, Optimal mulch rate can be an effective approach to virtually reduce costs or to maximize the area that can be treated. Meantime, soil conservationist should be aware that levels of mulch for short slopes might not be suitable for long slopes.

This research provides a probability prediction framework based on vine copulas. The predictor variables of the peak break-up water level are first chosen, the pair copula structure is then constructed by using vine copulas, the conditional density distribution function is derived to perform a probability prediction, and the peak break-up water level value can then be estimated from the conditional density distribution function given the conditional probability and fixed values of the predictor variables. This approach is exemplified using data from 1957 to 2005 for the Toudaoguai and Sanhuhekou stations, which are located in the Inner Mongolia Reach of the Yellow River, and the calibration and validation periods are divided at 1986. The mean curve of the peak break-up water level estimated from the conditional distribution function can capture the tendency of the observed series at both the Toudaoguai and Sanhuhekou stations, and more than 90% of the observed values fall within the 90% prediction uncertainty bands, which are approximately twice the standard deviation of the observed series. The probability prediction results for the validation period are consistent with those for the calibration period when the nonstationarity of the marginal distributions for the Sanhuhekou station are considered. Compared with multiple linear regression results, the uncertainty bands from the conditional distribution function are much narrower; moreover, the conditional distribution function is more capable of addressing the nonstationarity of predictor variables, and the conclusions are confirmed by jackknife analysis. Scenario predictions for cases in which the peak break-up water level is likely to be higher than the bankfull water level can also be conducted based on the conditional distribution function, with good performance for the two stations.

The restoration of vegetation on abandoned cropland has a major impact on the concentration and composition of the DOM and thus affects the biodegradability of the soil DOM. Understanding the response of the microbial degradation of the DOM to temperature is important to maintain soil bioavailable organic matter in the field. We conducted a laboratory DOM solution incubation experiment to examine the temporal dynamics of DOM concentrations at temperatures of 4 degrees C (low), 20 degrees C (medium), and 35 degrees C (high) for four types of land uses: sloped cropland, grassland, shrub land, and woodland. Ultraviolet visible and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to determine the structural complexity of the DOM. The conversion of the sloped cropland to shrub land and woodland significantly increased contents of DOC, DON, and recalcitrant substances in DOM soilution, such as humic-like material and fulvic acid, and stabilised the DOC pool, and reduced the decomposition of the DOC at 20 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The conversion of the sloped cropland to woodland dramatically reduced TDN decomposition. The DON loss after 60-day incubation significantly correlated with the initial content of tryptophan-like material. The biodegradability of the DON was higher and more sensitive to temperature than that of the DOC. Rising temperature initially promotes the decomposition of tryptophan-like material, and later promotes the degradation of more recalcitrant substances, such as humic-like material and fulvic acid, which enhanced the decomposition of the DOC and DON. The results suggest that the conversion of sloped cropland to shrubland and woodland not only promoted the accumulation of DOC, TDN, and recalcitrant substances in DOM solution, and decreased their biodegradability but also decreased the temperature sensitivity of the decomposition of the DOC and DON. Therefore, shrubland and woodland were the optimal choices for revegetation in the Loess Plateau of China.					fang, li/JNS-8415-2023; Liu, Hongfei/ABB-7132-2020; Zhang, Chao/JCE-5490-2023; Ai, Zemin/T-2463-2018	Liu, Hongfei/0000-0003-4391-0031; Ai, Zemin/0000-0002-0376-1468													0016-7061	1872-6259				MAR 1	2019	337						812	824		10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.10.041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.10.041													WOS:000456761500080

A9 and inhibition of microcystin release	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION												Algae such as Microcystis aeruginosa, which are involved in cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs), pose a serious threat to aquatic organisms and human health, and have become a severe environmental problem. In the search for efficient, ecofriendly and safe approaches to control CyanoHABs, we evaluated the algicidal potential of Paebubacillus sp. A9 (A9) cells, supernatants and cultures with flocculation properties against M. aeruginosa. The results showed that different fractions of A9 exhibited algicidal activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Initially, polysaccharides with a series of carboxyl groups released by A9 caused flocculation of M. aeruginosa cells, which was followed by the lysis of algal cells by the algicidal active compounds present in the A9 culture. The algicidal process activated the antioxidant system of M. aeruginosa, as evidenced by a dramatic increase in the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme. Simultaneously, photosynthetic pigments (Chl a), photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) and maximum relative photosynthetic electron transfer rate (ETRmax) were significantly decreased, indicating the impairment of the photosynthetic system of M. aeruginosa by A9 culture. Notably, inoculation with 6% A9 culture reduced the microcystin-LR (MC-LR) concentration by 90.65% compared to the control. Further analysis of fluorescent dissolved organic contaminants, disinfection by-product precursors, and nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in the algal culture, confirmed the environmentally safety of the A9-mediated algicidal process. Therefore, Paebubacillus sp. A9 be a potential candidate for controlling M. aeruginosa-induced CyanoHABs through its "flocculation-lysis-degradation" mechanism, coupled with nutrient regulation.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

In this study, we examined the effects of different pCO2 and Zn levels on growth rate, elemental compositions and silicification by Thalassiosira weissflogii. The results showed that under normal pCO2 (400 mu atm), cultures of T. weissflogii were depressed for growth rate and silica incorporation rate, but encouraged for cellular silicon content, Si/C, Si/N, and sinking rate when Zn deficient (0.3 pmol L-1). However, cellular silicon and sinking rate of Zn-deficient and Zn-replete (25 pmol L-1) T. weissflogii were decreased and increased at higher pCO2 (800 mu atm), respectively. Thus, acidification may affect diatoms significantly differently depending on the Zn levels of the ocean and then alter the biochemical cycling of carbon and silica.					huang, libo/JMB-4345-2023; Huang, Xu/HOH-0307-2023; Yang, Yifan/JTV-1487-2023; wu, xiaokang/JUJ-4602-2023; 黄, 旭/JFJ-8744-2023; Wang, Chao/JHT-6081-2023; wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023														0025-326X	1879-3363				DEC	2022	185		A						114327	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114327		NOV 2022						36356339					WOS:000891756500004

Hepper) as Influenced by Heat and Moisture Stresses in Different Dates of Sowing and Nutrient Management Conditions	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Heat and soil moisture stress account for serious abiotic constraint in black gram (Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper) production during spring-summer under Gangetic plains of Eastern India. Concurrence of these two can bring about early completion of phenophases that hampers normal metabolism of legumes by disrupting their defense mechanism, leading to poor seed set. The field experiment was conducted with two different sowing dates as the main plot, soil application of cobalt (Co) as subplots and foliar sprays of potassium (K) and boron (B) either alone or in combination as sub-sub plot treatment in a split-split plot design during spring-summer seasons of 2020 and 2021 with black gram (variety: Pant U 31). The study was aimed at evaluating the impact of sowing time and nutrients application alleviating adversities of abiotic stress during reproductive development of black gram. The March first week sown crop took significantly higher days to complete its life cycle compared to March third week sown one (82.0 vs. 78.2 and 81.8 vs. 78.8). This in turn relatively allowed a broader window for leaf area expansion, flowering, and seed filling in the first crop compared to the second one leading to the attainment of superior yield in the normal sown crop during the consecutive years. Crop growth rate (CGR), net assimilation rate (NAR), pod number per plant, seed yield, and harvest index were significantly higher (p <= 0.05) with soil Co @ 4 kg ha(-1) and foliar 1.25% K + 0.2% B applications through stress mitigation by stimulating chlorophyll biosynthesis, nitrate reductase activity, proline accumulation, and cell membrane stability, irrespective of the years. Fluctuations in per plant pod number explained about 96 and 94% variations in seed yield through linear regressions in respective years. Optimum sowing date along with soil Co application combined with foliar K+B sprays manifested immense potential to achieve higher black gram production. In addition, this nutrient schedule proved to be efficient enough to promote satisfactory growth and optimum seed yield of late sown blackgram through relief of stress during the spring-summer season.

To quantify microbial metabolism and nutrient limitation during plant secondary succession, we measured soil physicochemical properties, microbial biomass, and four enzyme activities (beta-1,4-glucosidase (BG), beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), L-leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and alkaline phosphatase (AP)) and identified the changes of soil ecoenzymatic stoichiometry and microbial nutrient limitation along a secondary succession series in typical arid and semi-arid ecosystems on the Loess Plateau, China. Soil enzyme activities increased in the first 17a succession and then decreased with plant secondary succession. The ln(BG):ln(NAG+ LAP) ratio and ln(BG):ln(AP) ratio showed a decreasing trend in the first 22a succession and then increased. Most soil nutrient contents and nutrient stoichiometry were significantly correlated with enzyme activities and enzymatic stoichiometry. Moreover, vector analysis of soil enzymes indicated that microbial community were co-limited by C and P during secondary succession. Linear regression of C:N and C:P between the soil nutrient and microbial community showed that soil microbial community maintained stoichiometry homeostasis during plant secondary succession. The threshold elemental ratio revealed that the microbial nutrient metabolisms were co-limited by N and P, particularly P during plant secondary succession. Therefore, microbial communities were co-limited by C, N, and P, particularly C and P during plant secondary succession, and the limitation was mainly associated with soil nutrient status.

In this study, precipitation variability and conservation tillage were jointly analyzed by precipitation levels (normal precipitation, 30% lower and 30% greater than normal precipitation), tillage methods (conventional tillage and no-tillage) and cover crop mulching (mulching and no mulching). It was found that no tillage (NT) increased the maize yield by 12.85% compared with the conventional tillage (CT) treatments. Above-normal precipitation treatments did not significantly increase biomass and soil water content across different fertility stages, but below-normal precipitation treatments reduced maize yield, crude protein (CP) content and soil water content at all soil levels. CT treatment significantly increased soil water content in the tillage layer (0-40 cm), but NT treatment significantly increased dry matter yield, plant height and CP content at harvest by 10.99, 3.41, 5.62%. Cover crop mulching significantly increased maize yield by 8.26% and soil moisture content at the seedling stage in 0-40 cm soil by 2.76 and 2.52%. The three-way interaction effects involving precipitation levels, tillage methods and cover crop mulching were significant for maize yield, CP content and soil water content (p < 0.05). In addition, this study found that soil water content was positively correlated with crude protein content of maize (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study concluded that a combination of NT and cover crop mulching should be used to mitigate maize production risks caused by precipitation variability in the karst areas.																				2571-581X				JUL 24	2023	7								1198649	10.3389/fsufs.2023.1198649	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1198649													WOS:001043406500001

Quantifying their impacts on grassland variation is essential to ensure sustainable grassland management. In this study, we employed the Thornthwaite Memorial and Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-approach (CASA) models to investigate the spatiotemporal effects of these two variables on grassland variation in northern China from 2000 to 2016, using the net primary productivity (NPP) as a measure. Our findings reveal that approximately 25.92% of the grassland in northern China experienced degradation, while restored grasslands occupied 45% of the total grassland area. The average grassland actual NPP (ANPP) and human-induced NPP decreased at rates of -0.60 and -5.62 gC m-2 a-1, respectively. Conversely, potential NPP exhibited an upward trend with an average increase of 2.27 gC m-2 a-1. Furthermore, grassland ANPP showed a projected increase in most parts of northern China. Climate change emerged as the primary driver for grassland restoration in Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia, leading to an increase of 21582.79 Gg C in grassland NPP. In contrast, human activities were the dominant catalysts for grassland degradation, resulting in a reduction of 51932.3 Gg C in grassland NPP. Human-induced grassland degradation was ubiquitous in northwest and northeast China. With the exception of slope grassland, climate change primarily influenced the restoration of most grassland types, while human activities were the primary cause of degradation. Our analysis indicated a strong correlation between temperature and grassland degradation, while precipitation played a pivotal role in grassland restoration in northern China. Human interference demonstrated both positive and negative impacts on grassland changes. In conclusion, the increase in precipitation and the implementation of ecological restoration plans have effectively promoted the restoration of grasslands in northern China.																			1085-3278	1099-145X				2023 SEP 26	2023										10.1002/ldr.4930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4930		SEP 2023											WOS:001070682000001
J	Mao, N; Wei, XR; Shao, MA				Mao, Na; Wei, Xiaorong; Shao, Mingan			Soil type-dependent effects of drying-wetting sequences on aggregates and their associated OC and N	INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Evaluating the impacts of drying-wetting (DW) cycles on soil aggregates and their associated organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) is crucial to understand the OC and N cycles. Soils are likely subjected to DW cycles with different sequences depending on seasons or in agroecosystems. However, studies on how DW sequences influence OC and N dynamics within aggregates, and whether this effect is dependent on soil type, are relatively limited. Herein, two DW sequences, i.e., drying-wetting-drying-wetting (2DW) and wetting-drying-wetting-drying (2WD) treatments were designed, and a consistent wetting (CW) was set as a control to assess the effects of DW sequences. Four soils (Entisol, Ultisol, Anthrosol and Mollisol) varying in texture and OC content were used. The aggregate size distribution, the OC, total N (TN), readily oxidizable OC (ROOC) and mineral N (Min-N) content in aggregates were determined. Results showed that 2DW treatment increased but 2WD treatment decreased the large aggregates of Entisol and Ultisol, while 2DW and 2WD treatments synchronously increased the large aggregates of Anthrosol but decreased them of Mollisol. Two DW treatments increased the OC in each aggregate of Entisol, Anthrosol and Mollisol but decreased them of Ultisol. The 2DW didn't affect but 2WD treatment decreased ROOC in 1-2 mm aggregates of Entisol and <0.25 mm aggregates of Ultisol and Mollisol. The 2DW and 2WD treatments minimally affected TN but potentially influenced Min-N in aggregates. The 2DW and 2WD treatments both decreased the Min-N in each aggregate size class of Entisol and Mollisol, while 2DW increased but 2WD treatment decreased Min-N in each aggregate of Ultisol and Anthrosol. These results indicated that the varied effects of DW sequences and the interactive effects of soil type with DW sequences on aggregate turnover and OC and N cycling should be recon-sidered to provide more precisive evidences for global C and N cycles under the scenario of future climate changes.

The pot experiment consisted of two-factors including three Cd treatments and two P treatments, and a clone of Populus x euramericana was used as plant material. Leaf development and gas exchange were less inhibited by Cd exposure than that by P defi-ciency. Under different P levels, Cd accumulation increased with the increasing intensity and duration of Cd exposure, while Cd accumulation in leaves was inhibited by P deficiency. With sufficient P nutrition, Cd content and Cd concentration of leaves reached 300 mu g plant-1 and 32 mu g g-1 DW, respectively. Cd was preferentially enriched in leaf veins to avoid Cd poisoning in photosynthetic apparatus. In the absence of Cd exposure, P promoted WUEi via increasing photosynthesis rate. In contrast, P nutrition promoted WUEi under Cd exposure via regulating stomata aperture and reducing water loss via transpiration. The activities of antioxidants including GR and CAT were enhanced by P addition, as a result of the elevated expression of related genes (Gr chl, Gr cyt, Cat2, Cat3). The mechanisms underlying the promotive effect of P on leaf function and Cd tolerance are eluci-dated. Phosphorus promotes leaf function and Cd tolerance of poplar by enhancing photosynthetic process, stomatal regulation and antioxidant defense. Phosphorus shortage reduced the levels of phytohormones, while P addition contributes to stress tolerance via promoting the levels of phytohormones including ABA, JA and IAA. Salicylic acid (SA) promotes stress tolerance under Cd exposure via affecting the inducement of antioxidant enzymes. The improved Cd tolerance of leaves facilitates leaf carbohydrate production, promotes Cd bio-extraction and benefits xylem development of poplars growing under Cd exposure.

Runoff from the whole contributing catchment is concentrated in AF, which makes influencing factors of AF gully erosion more complex than it is for hillslopes. There is a lack of quantitative research about the influencing factors and mechanisms of AF gully erosion. The main objectives of this study were to: (1) quantify gully erosion on AF; and (2) identify the controlling factors of gully erosion on AF. The gullies of 12 AF were investigated by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). To help understand better the gully erosion on AF, nine morphological parameters were measured, four gully quantitative characteristics were calculated, and 16 factors affecting the gully erosion on AF were analyzed. The gully width-depth ratio of over 20 on the studied AF is larger than that usually seen in other regions. The mean value of gully amount density (GAD), gully density (GD), the degree of gully dissection (GDD), and gully volume modulus (GVM) were 26.51 km(-)(2), 4.93 km center dot km(-)(2), 7.16%, and 1.28 x 10(-4) km(3)center dot km(-)(2), respectively. Linear correlations showed a significant (p < 0.05) relationship between the gully quantitative characteristics of AF and the catchment gully density. So, catchment gully density may indirectly affect gully erosion on AF by influencing hydrological connectivity and then changing generation and confluence processes of runoff in catchment. Therefore, gully erosion on AF can be mitigated by shifting hydrology pathway on AF and reducing hydrological connectivity in contributing catchment.

In this study, we tested if biofertilizers can not only enhance the yield of crops in monoculture as has previously been demonstrated but can also enhance the yield of intercropping systems. We hypothesized that because AMF can form common mycorrhizal networks (CMN) that can transfer nutrients and water between different plant species, biofertilization can balance belowground competition between crop species and promote thus overall yields in intercropping systems. In our study, we used a pigeon pea (PP)-finger millet (FM) intercropping system that we grew for two consecutive growing seasons (2016/17 and 2017/18) at two contrasting sites in Bengaluru and Kolli Hills, India. We also tested if the spatial arrangement (i.e., different arrangement of component plants with similar plant density in intercropping system) of intercropped plants, using either a row-wise or a mosaic design, influences the effect of biofertilizers on yield and water relations of the PP-FM intercropping system. Our results demonstrate that intercropping can improve the straw and grain yield of PP and FM compared to the respective monocultures and that intercropping effects vary depending on the site characteristic such as climate and soil type. The spatial arrangement of component plants affected the total, straw, and grain biomass in intercropping treatments, but this effect also varied across sites. Most importantly, the results from the 2017/18 growing season clearly demonstrated a positive effect of biofertilizer on biomass yield, and this effect was irrespective of site, spatial arrangement, mixed or monoculture. Our study therefore shows that yield increase in intercropping systems can further be improved through the application of biofertilizers.

Identification of genetic loci for PHS resistance will facilitate breeding sprouting-resistant wheat cultivars. In this study, we constructed a genetic map comprising 1,702 non-redundant markers in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from cross Yangxiaomai/Zhongyou9507 using the wheat 15K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay. Four quantitative trait loci (QTL) for germination index (GI), a major indicator of PHS, were identified, explaining 4.6-18.5% of the phenotypic variances. Resistance alleles of Qphs.caas-3AL, Qphs.caas-3DL, and Qphs.caas-7BL were from Yangxiaomai, and Zhongyou9507 contributed a resistance allele in Qphs.caas-4AL. No epistatic effects were detected among the QTL, and combined resistance alleles significantly increased PHS resistance. Sequencing and linkage mapping showed that Qphs.caas-3AL and Qphs.caas-3DL corresponded to grain color genes Tamyb10-A and Tamyb10-D, respectively, whereas Qphs.caas-4AL and Qphs.caas-7BL were probably new QTL for PHS. We further developed cost-effective, high-throughput kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers tightly linked to Qphs.caas-4AL and Qphs.caas-7BL and validated their association with GI in a test panel of cultivars. The resistance alleles at the Qphs.caas-4AL and Qphs.caas-7BL loci were present in 72.2 and 16.5% cultivars, respectively, suggesting that the former might be subjected to positive selection in wheat breeding. The findings provide not only genetic resources for PHS resistance but also breeding tools for marker-assisted selection.

J	Wen, SH; Wang, J; Li, YP; Shao, MA				Wen, Shuhai; Wang, Jiao; Li, Yanpei; Shao, Ming'an			Effects of anecic earthworms on runoff and erosion on the slope with soil from the Loess Plateau under a rainfall simulation experiment	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Earthworms are ecological engineers that play an important role in hydrological processes and soil erosion by their burrowing and casting activities. Little is known, however, about the ecological function of the activities of an anecic species (Metaphire guillelmi) from the Loess Plateau in China where the soil is severely eroded. We conducted rain-simulation experiments on artificial slopes (mesocosms) filled with soil from Loess Plateau. Two rain intensities (90 and 120 mm h(-1)) and slope gradients (5 degrees and 15 degrees) were used to investigate the influences of earthworm activity on runoff and soil loss under multiple conditions. Data from 15 d of earthworm activity and 1 h of rain indicated that earthworm activity significantly reduced runoff but aggravated soil erosion. Runoff initiation time increased 2.7-3.1-fold, contributing to the promotion of water infiltration, and the amounts and rates of runoff were 35.8-61.6% and 35.1-60.8% lower under earthworm activity than the controls, respectively. Earthworms greatly influenced the physical and chemical properties of the soil, and these properties were strongly correlated with runoff initiation time and cumulative runoff. The surface casts produced by the earthworms on the soil surface were completely dispersed, increasing the cumulative sediment by a maximum of 169%. Both rain intensity and slope gradient greatly influence runoff and soil detachment, but with earthworm activity, slope gradient was more influential due to its superior contribution to sediment transport. This study quantified the effects of M. guillelmi on runoff and soil erosion and provides basic data for developing a more integrated control of soil erosion on the Loess Plateau.					wu, yunhui/JGD-6838-2023; lin, qing/JED-5250-2023														0378-3774	1873-2283				JAN 1	2022	259								107230	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107230	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107230		OCT 2021											WOS:000707037500008

Lipids that are more polar, have longer hydrocarbon chains, and are less bulky are often packed in more ordered phase states to slow cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL); these lipids also resist transitions to more disordered phases at high ambient temperatures (T-a). In bats, wing and tail membranes (wing patagia and tail uropatagium, respectively) allow powered flight, but increase surface area, and hence CEWL, with implications for survival in arid environments. We captured Pipistrellus kuhlii from an arid habitat and measured the lipid composition of the SC of the plagiopatagium in the wing, the uropatagium, and the non-membranous region (NMR) of the body using thin layer chromatography and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure photoionization mass spectrometry. The patagia contained more cholesterol and shorter-chained ceramides, and fewer cerebrosides than the NMR, indicating that the lipid phase transition temperature in the patagia is lower than in the NMR. Thus, at moderate T-a the lipids in the SC in all body regions will remain in an ordered phase state, allowing water conservation; but as T-a increases, the lipids in the SC of the patagia will more easily transition into a disordered phase, resulting in increased CEWL from the patagia facilitating efficient heat dissipation in hot environments.

This study conducted a greenhouse experiment combined with Cd and N treatments to elucidate the mechanism underlying the influence of N on Cd accumulation and acclimation strategy in Populus leaves. Chlorophyll concentration and net photosynthetic rates (A) in leaves were unaltered by Cd exposure regardless of N condition. Nitrogen availability alter acclimation strategy of poplar leaves under cadmium exposure. Under sufficient N, Cd accumulation in leaves was elevated with increased intensity and duration of Cd exposure; Cd accumulation reached ca. 28 mu g g(-1) dry weight and 260 mu g plant(-1) after 60 days of exposure to high level of Cd (20 mg Cd kg(-1) soil), and this finding indicates a large potential for Cd phytoextraction. Poplar leaves exhibited high capacity for antioxidant defense and stress tolerance and avoided oxidative damage under high Cd exposure. The levels of phytohormones and antioxidants in leaves and the relative expressions of critical genes encoding antioxidant enzymes were up-regulated under sufficient N condition. Nitrogen deficiency decreased chlorophyll concentration and net photosynthetic rates (A) and interfered with the production of N metabolites, resulting in a low level of phytohormones and antioxidants that are responsible for stress tolerance. The low levels of Cd accumulation in leaves may be a self-protecting strategy to prevent severe oxidative damage due to the decreased capacities for stress tolerance under N deficiency.

Inhibitor or biochar applications have proven effective in reducing N2O emissions and pro-moting crop yields worldwide. However, a direct comparison of the response of N2O emissions and crop yields to in-hibitor and biochar applications has not been performed. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 787 datasets fromdifferent locations worldwide to investigate the response of N2O emissions and crop yields to inhibitor or biochar ap-plications for different climate factors and experimental conditions and determine the key influencing factors. Wefound that inhibitor applications (37.4 %) resulted in larger N2O emission reductions than biochar applications(20.2 %), but there was no difference in the crop yield improvement (5.8 % and 5.4 %, respectively). Nitrification in-hibitor (NI) applications reduced N2O emissions by 40.8 %, a larger reduction than that of urease inhibitor (UI) appli-cations (24.3 %) and the combination of NI and UI applications (36.4 %); 3,4-dimethylpyrazole succinic (DMPSA) wasthe most effective NI in reducing N2O emissions (50.7 %). We also found that NI applications were more effective inreducing N2O emissions than biochar applications in different climates and experimental conditions (N source, Nrate, cropland type, and soil texture). In addition, the N rate was the most important factor impacting N2O emissionsand crop yields when inhibitors were applied, whereas the experimental duration had the largest influence on N2Oemissions under biochar applications. Moreover, soil factors were also related to N2O emissions under biochar appli-cations or inhibitor applications. Ourfindings indicate that inhibitors are more effective in reducing N2O emissionsthan biochar worldwide.					贾, 晓宇/AHB-0724-2022; Yan, Weiming/CAG-9069-2022	贾, 晓宇/0000-0001-6011-1472; Yan, Weiming/0000-0001-5509-0806													0048-9697	1879-1026				FEB 10	2023	859		2						160416	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160416	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160416		NOV 2022						36427723					WOS:000906923200012
J	Yan, JK; Liu, PL				Yan, Jiakun; Liu, Puling			Does Complex Soil Enhance Grain Yield under Cropping System?	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Global climate change and the increasing population have increased the difficulties associated with grain production. Several measures have been established to maintain a high crop yield, while preserving or increasing soil health, including biochar application to soil, and producing new complex soil with soil amendment application, e.g., biochar and soft rocks. However, previous studies have focused on the effect of complex soil on a single crop but have not considered crop rotation. In this study, field plots with foxtail millet cultivated for two years under biochar and soft rock application were selected for licorice cultivation to detect the effects of biochar and soft rock application on soil properties and licorice yield. The results showed that the biochar-treated plot had the highest licorice biomass (251.76 g/m(2)), followed by the combined biochar and soft rock treatment, and that the soft rock and control treatments had the lowest licorice biomass (97.65 g/m(2)). Plants in biochar-treated plots had the highest liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid contents, followed by those under soft rock treatment. Soft rocks and biochar increased the soil catalase activity, organic matter, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, formic acid, and available phosphorus (AP). Correlation analysis showed that the licorice biomass was significantly positively correlated with oxalic acid and AP and negatively correlated with soil pH. AP was positively correlated with catalase activity and oxalic acid (p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with soil pH (p < 0.05). Therefore, it can be concluded that the addition of biochar and soft rocks for two years could increase soil organic acid contents (especially that of oxalic acid), which function to reduce soil pH, increase soil AP content, and enhance licorice biomass.					liu, pu/HOH-6399-2023; yan, jiakun J/F-5013-2011; Yan, Jiakun/AAN-5352-2020; yan, jiakun/GRJ-3297-2022	Yan, Jiakun/0000-0001-8844-6098; yan, jiakun/0000-0001-8844-6098														2073-4395				AUG	2021	11	8							1502	10.3390/agronomy11081502	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11081502													WOS:000688606200001
J	Jiang, DJ; Li, Z; Luo, YM; Xia, Y				Jiang, Dejuan; Li, Zhi; Luo, Yongming; Xia, Yun			River damming and drought affect water cycle dynamics in an ephemeral river based on stable isotopes: The Dagu River of North China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The flow regime and biogeochemical cycles are greatly affected by river damming and drought, especially in ephemeral rivers. However, the combined effects have been rarely considered. This study, taking the Dagu River in Jiaodong Peninsula of North China as an example, investigated the dynamic changes in water cycle related to river damming and drought using stable water isotopes for the period 2018-2019. The results indicated that riverwater isotopes significantly varied temporally and spatially. The temporal variations in riverwater isotopes appeared to be linked with those in precipitation, but the relationship between river water and precipitation isotopes was greatly affected by river damming, river water-groundwater exchange and potential water pollution. Spatially, a single dam exhibited no significant effect on riverwater isotopes, but the accumulative impacts of cascade dams resulted in the enrichment of heavy isotopes in river water towards the downstream through increasing hydraulic residence time and water evaporation largely. The inter-annual variations in river water isotopes with increased evaporative fractionationwere highlighted by their strong response to the drought in 2019. The combined effects of cascade dams and drought greatly changed water cycle dynamics and further exacerbated water shortage, which should thus be fully considered for water resource management, especially for regions with water-limited but heavily-regulated rivers.

J	Gong, C; Tan, QY; Xu, MX; Liu, GB				Gong, Chen; Tan, Qingyue; Xu, Mingxiang; Liu, Guobin			Mixed-species plantations can alleviate water stress on the Loess Plateau	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												In recent years, the ability of mixed-species plantations to cope with environmental changes has been a focus of research. Despite compelling evidence indicating that mixed-species plantations can provide many economic, environmental and social benefits, whether they can also enhance regional stress responses to drought remains unclear. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted based on 457 field observations to assess the effects of different planting patterns on the soil moisture of 500 cm on the Loess Plateau. The results showed that both monoculture and mixed-species plantations consumed significant soil moisture content. However, compared with monoculture plantations, mixed-species plantations were better able to maintain the soil moisture at 0-400 cm. Soil moisture content varied by topography, climate, vegetation species and planting age. We observed that afforestation was a good choice for areas with the high precipitation ( > 500 mm), the middle elevation (1200-1600 m) and slope (20-30 degrees). Furthermore, the arbors mixed with shrubs did not significantly consume the soil moisture content and was more sensitive to the change in planting ages. In addition, the response sizes of soil moisture among different vegetation species were negatively correlated with the initial soil moisture content. We therefor concluded that mixed-species plantations, especially arbors mixed with shrubs were conducive to enhancing drought resistance in arid and semiarid regions. In considering future afforestation activities, planners need to be aware that different environments support different vegetation species and patterns. This study provides a reference and guidance for the scientific planning and sustainable development of forest ecosystem in arid and semiarid regions.

This hinders our ability to assess the true impact of erosion on soil ecosystem services and our ability to restore eroded environments. Here we examined the effect of erosion on microbial communities at two sites with contrasting soil texture and climates. Eroded plots had lower microbial network complexity, fewer microbial taxa, and fewer associations among microbial taxa, relative to non-eroded plots. Soil erosion also shifted microbial community composition, with decreased relative abundances of dominant phyla such as Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Gemmatimonadetes. In contrast, erosion led to an increase in the relative abundances of some bacterial families involved in N cycling, such as Acetobacteraceae and Beijerinckiaceae. Changes in microbiota characteristics were strongly related with erosion-induced changes in soil multifunctionality. Together, these results demonstrate that soil erosion has a significant negative impact on soil microbial diversity and functionality.

While transcriptional regulation of light-induced chlorophyll and glycoalkaloids accumulation has been extensively investigated, the mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation through miRNA remain largely unexplored. An experimental model, the tubers of Solanum chacoense, were used to identify light-responsive miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) related to tuber greening and glycoalkaloid biosynthesis by employing multi-omics approaches (miRNA-seq and degradome-seq). A total of 732 unique mature miRNAs have been identified in S. chacoense. In total, 6335 unique target transcripts were cleaved by 489 known miRNAs and 153 novel miRNAs. The results revealed that light-responsive miRNAs can be grouped into eight temporally related clusters and play important roles in various physiological processes such as plant growth, stress responses, and primary and secondary metabolism. Multi-omics analyses have revealed that the modulation of transcript abundance of MYB59, HSPs, and EBF1/EBF2 by light-responsive miRNAs is pivotal for their function in cross-tolerance responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses. Furthermore, our findings suggest that many light-responsive miRNAs are crucial regulators in various biosynthetic pathways, including tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, suberin biosynthesis, and steroid biosynthesis. These findings highlight the significant role of light-responsive miRNAs in secondary metabolic pathways, particularly in isoprenoid, terpenoid, and glycoalkaloid biosynthesis, and have implications for the precise manipulation of metabolic pathways to produce new potato varieties with improved resistance to greening and lower glycoalkaloid levels.

A control (CK - no additives) and seven treatments were tested, namely, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (LP), Lentilactobacillus buchneri (LB), propionic acid (PA), calcium propionate (CAP), LP + LB; LP + PA and LP + CAP. In comparison with CK, all treatments increased the contents of crude protein and lactic acid, decreased the content of butyric acid, and altered the bacterial communities of the silage. Except for the CAP and LP + CAP treatments, the additives decreased pH and the ammonia nitrogen:total nitrogen (NH3-N:TN) ratio. The results of principal component analysis revealed that the PA, LP + PA and LP + LB treatments ranked as the top three silages. The PA and LP + PA treatments exhibited higher water-soluble carbohydrate content, but lower pH, and NH3-N:TN ratio than the other treatments. With the PA and LP + PA treatments, the relative abundances of Lactobacillus and Enterobacter decreased, and of Proteobacteria and Delftia increased, while the carbohydrate metabolism of the microorganisms improved. The LP and LB treatments reduced the Shannon and Simpson diversities. In the beta diversity, PA and LP + PA separated from the other treatments, indicating that there were differences in the composition of bacterial species. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus increased in the LP and LB treatments and of Leucanostoc and Weissella increased in the CAP and LP + CAP treatments. In summary, the addition of L. plantarum, L. buchneri, propionic acid, calcium propionate, and their combinations improved fermentation quality, inhibited harmful bacteria and conserved the nutrients of hybrid Pennisetum.																				1664-302X				JUN 29	2023	14								1216722	10.3389/fmicb.2023.1216722	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1216722								37455750					WOS:001024993700001

The analysis of site specific N2O isotopic composition may help to quantify the pathway of N2O reduction to N-2 during denitrification process. In manure-amended soil (chicken manure, cow manure and sheep manure), N2O reduction was evaluated by examining the N2O emissions in the presence of acetylene (C2H2) and by analyzing the N2O isotopocule deltas. The results indicated that the three manures had no significant dif-ferences for the N2O emission rates and N2O isotopocule deltas. The extent of N2O reduction to N-2 was 81-84% using the mapping of Delta delta O-18(N2O-H2O/N2O-NO3-) (different value of delta O-18 between the N2O and H2O or NO3-) vs. SP (N-15 site preference in N2O) and approximately 76% using C2H2 (10% v/v) inhibition method under 60% WFPS (water-filled pore space). Moreover, complete N2O reduction held eta O-18(R) and SPR (net isotopocule effect of N2O reduction to N-2) values of -13.6 parts per thousand and -6.7 parts per thousand, respectively. It was also found that oxygen exchange between N2O and soil water was approximately 92%. In summary, the mapping of Delta delta O-18(N2O-H2O/N2O-NO3-) vs. SP was very useful to distinguish the production and consumption pathways of N2O during denitrification. The extent of N2O reduction was underestimated by the C2H2 method. These results provide guidance in correcting the acetylene effect, which is important in evaluating the impact of manure on the N2O reduction.

Results indicated that intrinsic viscosity ([eta]) and viscosity average molecular weight ([M-v]) decreased with the increased time from 0 to 30 min but increased when the duration prolonged to 45 min. The change of apparent viscosity with shear rate of all pectin solutions could be well described by Sisko model (R-2 >= .996) and the infinite-rate viscosity (eta(infinity)) and the consistency coefficient (k(s)) values decreased after ultrasonic treatment. Ultrasonic treatment could have an effect on dynamic moduli and activation energy of sugar beet pectin solutions. Particle size of pectin emulsions decreased and absolute zeta potential increased with increased time from 0 to 20 min. Excessive ultrasonic duration (30 and 45 min) could result in the aggregation of oil droplets in pectin emulsion and decrease in emulsifying stability. It could be concluded that ultrasonic treatment could affect the rheological and emulsifying properties of sugar beet pectin. The results have important implications for understanding the ultrasonic modification of sugar beet pectin.

In this study, a slope changing ratio of cumulative quantity (SCRCQ) approach is introduced to separate the contributions of climate change and human activities from runoff changes, and to propose a conceptual model to secure a management strategy under the implications of the changing environment, based on these datasets, including observation climate and runoff data, satellite remote sensing images (MODIS and Landsat) and the observed land use data. Through this investigation, the following results were achieved. Firstly, the annual average runoff exhibited a non-significant decreasing trend from upstream to downstream over the Lancang and Jinsha rivers with a change rate of -26.3 mm/10 year, the runoff had a sharp decrease in drought years, especially in 1984, 2006 and 2009 by 26%, 28% and 24%, respectively, at the Jiajiu station. Secondly, the cropland decreased by 803 Km(2) and the forestland increased by 423 Km(2) which finally resulted in a significant decline in runoff, the change rate was -15 mm per year (4%) and -71 mm per year (8%) over the Lancang and Jinsha river basins, respectively from 2000 to 2010. Thirdly, the average observed runoff in the "pre-dam" period (1980-1992) increased by 7% in the "post-dam" period (1993-2015). Improving the weather modifications and water-saving technology can help retain water resources in the rainy seasons to relieve drought in the dry seasons. Finally, a comprehensive assessment model was applied to select plant species in the ecological restoration areas, which have implications for environmental protection, water resource management and ecological restoration in the rivers of southwest China.					abdo, ahmed/GLT-8721-2022; He, Hongming/A-4161-2010	abdo, ahmed/0000-0003-2637-8573; 													2053-1400	2053-1419				MAR 1	2020	6	3					656	678		10.1039/c9ew00883g	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ew00883g													WOS:000519272700016

Nestedness and beta diversity of gastrointestinal helminth communities in common warthogs, <i>Phacochoerus africanus</i> (Suidae), at 2 localities in South Africa	PARASITOLOGY												Few studies have investigated the ecological interactions between wild species of Suidae and their parasites, leaving our knowledge concerning this host-parasite system fragmented. In the present study, we applied network studies to analyse community nestedness in helminth assemblages of common warthogs, Phacochoerus africanus (Gmelin) (Suidae). Helminth data were compiled from 95 warthogs, including young and adult males and females, from 2 different conservation areas in Mpumalanga and Limpopo Provinces, South Africa, collected monthly over a period of 1 year each. The aim was to study the effect of host sex, age and season of sampling on the structure of helminth infracommunities harboured by the warthogs and to search for non-random structural patterns in the warthog-helminth interaction networks. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of a warthog's age, sex and season of sampling on beta diversity and dark diversity of their helminth infracommunities. Lastly, we asked whether the effects of host sex, age and sampling season on helminth communities differed between the 2 localities. We found that helminth communities of warthogs were nested and host-parasite interactions were influenced by all 3 factors as well as combinations thereof. However, the resulting patterns differed at the 2 localities, indicating that local environmental processes are important drivers of community structure.																			0031-1820	1469-8161				SEP	2023	150	10					911	921		10.1017/S0031182023000719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182023000719								37553973					WOS:001085123700005

The response of the soil microbial community to climate warming modulates the feedback between ecosystem C cycling and future climate change. We conducted a long-term manipulative warming (1.6 degrees C increase of the soil temperature at 5 cm) experiment to examine the soil respiration, microbial biomass, and community composition at an alpine meadow site on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. After nine years of warming, soil respiration (3.5 mu mol m(2) s(-1) in control in the growing season) increased in the warmed plots. In the early growing season, the increase in heterotrophic respiration (R-h) accounted for more than 90% of the increase in soil respiration. The warming effect gradually decreased during the mid and late growing season (46%). Microbial biomass C and nitrogen declined significantly in the 0-10 cm to the 30-50 cm layer. Warming did not significantly affect microbial biomass C and N in any soil depth layer. Metabolic activity of microbes in terms of Rh per unit microbial biomass C significantly increased by 66% in warmed plots. The bacterial and fungal community composition did not significantly change in the warmed plots. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria decreased at 20-30 cm and 30-50 cm soil depths, but that of Cercozoa increased in all four soil layers. The relative Actinobacteria abundance was negatively correlated with R-h and metabolic activity in the 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers. Our results indicate a decrease in Actinobacteria abundance, increases in metabolic activity, and no substrate limitation sustained the positive warming effect on soil respiration throughout the last 9 years. This implies that climate warming could trigger a substantial loss of soil C to the atmosphere in the alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

This work reassesses crop response to availability of saline soil water ASW in two stages (A) Develop a simple approach suggesting that permanent wilting point (WP) increases under high saline soil water tension and relative yield of Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L., var longifolia Lam., cv. Nevada) and maize (Zea mays L., cv. Jubilee sweet) decrease. (B) Using a deterministic numerical soil water model to validate the theory on Bermuda grass of golf courses. The experimental plots were established in the North Negev, Israel (Sweet corn) and the Algarve, Portugal (Lettuce and Bermuda grass covering the golf courses). Sprinkler irrigation and line source techniques were used for water application, creating a saline gradient under a precise irrigation water distribution. Two salinity empirical models were tested (Mass and Hoffman MH and van Genuchten-Gupta vGG). Their empirical models were modified and instead of soil electrical conductivity of irrigation water (ECe) we used wilting point (WP) and RASW to follow the changes in relative yield. The validation was conducted with theoretical soil plant atmosphere water (SPAW) to predict the results on golf courses. It is concluded that an alternative S-shaped response model provides better fit to our experimental data sets. Modified MH model (Yr = Y/Ymax = a * (ASW-threshold's constant) revealed that a single dimensionless curve could be used to express yield-salinity interference when represented by varying ASW. The vGG model: vGG can represent salt tolerance of most crops, by using varying wilting point of average root zone salinity, at which the yield has declined by 50%. The abscissa of both models was based on WP rather than the standard soil electrical conductivity (ECw). The correlation between the experimental data and WP or relative available soil water (RASW) was acceptable and, therefore, their usefulness for prediction of relative yield is acceptable as well. The objectives of this study were: 1. To develop a simple model describing the effect of salinity through soil water availability on crop production; 2. To replace the standard varying soil electrical conductivity ECe used by MH and vGG models by two soil parameters (at wilting point- theta(wp) and at field capacity theta(fc)) in order to describe the relationship between them and relative yield. 3.

Concentrate (C) and forage (F) were offered the calves at a ratio of 60:40. There was no difference (P = 0.92) in body mass (mb) between sexes, but there was a difference (P < 0.001) among ages. Significant differences (P < 0.001) were observed in the dry matter intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI), neutral detergent fiber intake (NDFI), acid detergent fiber intake (ADFI), gross energy intake (GEI), digestive energy intake (DEI), and metabolizable energy intake (MEI) among ages and between sexes. The CH4 emission (g/d) and the energy equivalent of CH4 emission (MJ/d) increased (P < 0.005) with increasing age, and they were higher (P < 0.005) in males than in females. There was no difference (P = 0.22) in CH4 emission between sexes in g CH4/kg DMI. Using simple linear regressions, DMI, OMI, and NDFI each explained 49-50% of the variation in CH4 emission; whereas, GEI explained 49% of the energy loss due to CH4 emission. In multiple regressions, NDFI and either mb or ADFI explained 49-50% of the variation in CH4 emission. It was concluded that CH4 emission in yaks: (1) tended to be lower than emissions reported in the literature for cattle and Murrah buffalo calves fed diets of similar C:F ratios; and, (2) as in cattle, can be predicted by dry matter intake.					han, xiao/HDN-9782-2022														0377-8401	1873-2216				NOV	2021	281								115088	10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.115088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2021.115088		SEP 2021											WOS:000726818800004

Effects of a 10-year irrigation with saline water on soil physico-chemical properties and cotton production	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Saline water irrigation has been widely used for crop production where agriculture is short of freshwater.To reveal the responses of soil environment and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) growth to long-term irrigation with saline water, a 10-year (2006 to 2015) experiment was carried out to study the effects of saline water irrigation on soil physico-chemical properties, as well as the yield and fiber quality of cotton in the low plain around the Bohai Sea (BHLP), China. Five salinity levels of irrigation water were tested (3.4 [T1], 7.1 [T2], 10.6 [T3],14.1 [T4], and 17.7 dS m(-1) [T5]), and freshwater (1.3 dS m(-1)) was used as control (CK). The results showed that from 2006 to 2015, the electrical conductivity of a saturated soil extract (ECe) in 0 to 100 cm soil depth did not accumulate linearly with years for all treatments but positively correlated with the ratio of irrigation to precipitation. Cotton yield decreased significantly when salinity of irrigation water exceeded 10.6 dS m(-1). Fiber quality tended to get worse when salinity of irrigation water reached 17.7 dS m(-1). In the tenth year, EC, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), the content of silt and clay equivalent size particles, and bulk density of soil plow layer increased with increasing salinity of irrigation water, while soil porosity and the content of macroaggregate in plow layer decreased. Compared with the initial chemical properties of soil plow layer in 2006, pH and SAR for saline water treatments increased at the late stage of cotton growth in 2015.The assessment results of soil quality index (SQL) showed that, in comparison with CK treatment, SQI decreased by 3.7%, 11.1%, 16.9%, 21.0%, and 21.7% in T1,T2, T3, T4, and T5, respectively. Therefore, from the aspect of the soil quality of plow layer in the BHLP, long-term use of irrigation with saline water above 3.4 dS m(-1) will decrease soil quality, and this agricultural management should be paid more attention.

The two studied species feature different bioturbation modes involving bioirrigation and upward bioconveyance. The Cr concentrations in the overlying water and pore water were measured and compared using treatments with bioturbation by a single species and by combinations of both species and a treatment with no organisms. The results indicated that both bioturbation modes significantly increased the Cr concentrations in the overlying water and pore water. The overlying water had lower Cr concentrations than the pore water. Little variation in the Cr concentrations was observed in the treatment without organisms. Both species enhanced the Cr flux from the pore water to the overlying water. The worm treatments had a great impact on the Cr concentration in the overlying water through intensive upward conveyance activity, while the chironomid larvae treatments exerted significant effects on the Cr variation in the pore water and Cr flux across the interface via bioirrigation activity. These findings reveal the importance of bioturbation in biogeochemical processes in freshwater ecosystems.

J	Wu, HX; Ge, Y				Wu, Haixia; Ge, Yan			Excessive Application of Fertilizer, Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollution, and Farmers' Policy Choice	SUSTAINABILITY												This paper takes 516 households who planted wheat in Heyang County, Shaanxi Province in 2018, as samples to construct three policy environments: Technological guidance for planting, subsidies for organic fertilizer application, and agricultural tailwater discharge standards. The experimental choice method was used to empirically analyze policy preferences during the process of fertilizer reduction. The results indicate that households show different preferences for the three policy settings: The fertilizer application rate is reduced by 6.98% if providing full technological guidance for farmers throughout the wheat planting process and is reduced by 5.18% under the background of providing appropriate organic fertilizer subsidies. The agricultural tailwater discharge standards have the least impact on the reducing level of chemical fertilizer application, with decreasing amounts of only 1.85% and 0.77% under the second-level and the first-level agricultural tailwater discharge standards, respectively. These results indicate that households in Heyang County, Shaanxi Province, demonstrate a low willingness to accept the agricultural tailwater discharge standards in order to cut down on the amount of chemical fertilizer application and the agricultural non-point source pollution. Therefore, compared with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1% of fertilizer usage nationwide according to the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, given the current planting environment and policies design, providing comprehensive technological guidance as well as price subsidies for the organic fertilizer can significantly and robustly reduce the excessive application of fertilizer in Heyang County, Shaanxi Province, under the best scenario, thereby further alleviating agricultural non-point source pollution.

The species composition of local flea assemblages at a small scale in two South American regions is predominantly driven by niche-based mechanisms	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												We applied a step-down factor analysis (SDFA) and multi-site generalised dissimilarity modelling (MS-GDM) to local flea communities harboured by small mammals (i.e., collected at small sampling sites over a short time period) in two South American regions (Patagonia and the Northwestern Argentina) with the aim of understanding whether these communities were assembled via niche-based or dispersal-based processes. The SDFA allows us to determine whether clusters of flea assemblages across different types of climates, vegetation and soils can be distinguished (suggesting niche-based assembly). MS-GDM allows us to determine whether a substantial proportion of the variation in flea species turnover is explained by specific climate-associated, vegetation-associated and soil-associated variables (indicating niche-based assembly) or host turnover (indicating dispersal-based assembly). Mapping of assemblages on climate, vegetation and soil maps, according to their loadings on axis 1 or axis 2 of the SDFA, did not provide clear-cut results. Clusters of similar loadings could be recognized within some, but not other, climate, vegetation and soil types. However, MS-GDM demonstrated that the effect of environmental variables (especially air temperature) on flea compositional turnover was much stronger than that of host turnover, indicating the predominance of niche-based processes in local community assembly. A comparison of our results with those on the mechanisms that drive species assembly in regional communities allows us to conclude that local and regional communities result from the joint action of niche-based and dispersal-based processes, with the former more important at a smaller spatial scale and the latter at a larger spatial scale.

However, there is limited data on the variation of these three parameters for annual crops under different environmental conditions. Gas exchange measurements of light and CO2 response curves on leaves of winter wheat and spring wheat were conducted during the wheat growing season under different environmental conditions. There were no significant differences for V-cmax, J(max) or m between the two wheat types. The seasonal variation of V-cmax, J(max) and m for spring wheat was not pronounced, except a rapid decrease for V-cmax and J(max) at the end of growing season. V-cmax and J(max) show no significant changes during soil drying until light saturated stomatal conductance (g(ssat)) was smaller than 0.15 mol m(-2) s(-1). Meanwhile, there was a significant difference in m during two different water supply conditions separated by g(ssat) at 0.15 mol m(-2) s(-1). Furthermore, the misestimation of V-cmax and J(max) had great impacts on the net photosynthesis rate simulation, whereas, the underestimation of m resulted in underestimated stomatal conductance and transpiration rate and an overestimation of water use efficiency. Our work demonstrates that the impact of severe environmental conditions and specific growing stages on the variation of key model parameters should be taken into account for simulating gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Meanwhile, modification of m and V-cmax (and J(max)) successively based on water stress severity might be adopted to simulate gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere under drought.

Fire regimes, such as fire severity, fire intensity, and percentage of burned area (PBA), may influence Delta T-fire through their impacts on postfire vegetation damage and, if so, there may be important feedbacks between fire regime and climate warming through biophysical effects. Here, we employ satellite observations to investigate postfire diurnal Delta T-fire across NABF. We further use a stepwise multiple linear regression model to examine the driving factors for Delta T-fire by incorporating latitude, fire regime variables, and their interactions. Our results demonstrate a pronounced asymmetry in diurnal Delta T-fire, characterized by daytime warming in contrast to nighttime cooling. Clear latitudinal patterns are found in Delta T-fire, with stronger effects in lower latitudes. Such latitudinal patterns of Delta T-fire, especially the daytime one, are driven by both latitudinal patterns in fire regimes and an increased sensitivity of Delta T-fire to fire regime as the latitude decreases. The multiple linear regression model explains 37% of the variance in daytime Delta T-fire, whereas for the nighttime Delta T-fire the explanatory power is rather low (5%). For daytime Delta T-fire, fire severity accounted for most (43.65%) of the model explanatory power, followed by PBA (24.60%) and fire intensity (13.10%). Our results highlight important fire regime impacts on daytime Delta T-fire and, further, on the annual Delta T-fire, suggesting that fire might amplify future boreal climate change through positive feedbacks between fire regime and postfire surface warming.

BMC PLANT BIOLOGY												BackgroundHeterosis is a complex phenomenon wherein the hybrids outperform their parents. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanism by which hybridization leads to higher yields in allopolyploid cotton is critical for effective breeding programs. Here, we integrated DNA methylation, transcriptomes, and small RNA profiles to comprehend the genetic and molecular basis of heterosis in allopolyploid cotton at three developmental stages.ResultsTranscriptome analysis revealed that numerous DEGs responsive to phytohormones (auxin and salicylic acid) were drastically altered in F1 hybrid compared to the parental lines. DEGs involved in energy metabolism and plant growth were upregulated, whereas DEGs related to basal defense were downregulated. Differences in homoeologous gene expression in F1 hybrid were greatly reduced after hybridization, suggesting that higher levels of parental expression have a vital role in heterosis. Small RNAome and methylome studies showed that the degree of DNA methylation in hybrid is higher when compared to the parents. A substantial number of allele-specific expression genes were found to be strongly regulated by CG allele-specific methylation levels. The hybrid exhibited higher 24-nt-small RNA (siRNA) expression levels than the parents. The regions in the genome with increased levels of 24-nt-siRNA were chiefly related to genes and their flanking regulatory regions, demonstrating a possible effect of these molecules on gene expression. The transposable elements correlated with siRNA clusters in the F1 hybrid had higher methylation levels but lower expression levels, which suggest that these non-additively expressed siRNA clusters, reduced the activity of transposable elements through DNA methylation in the hybrid.ConclusionsThese multi-omics data provide insights into how changes in epigenetic mechanisms and gene expression patterns can lead to heterosis in allopolyploid cotton. This makes heterosis a viable tool in cotton breeding.

To this end, 12 dam-controlled catchments were selected for investigation after an extreme rainstorm event in the northern Shaanxi Province on 25-26 July 2017 (known as the "7.26" rainstorm). Soil erosion intensities in the 12 catchments were obtained by excavations of sedimentation profiles and sedimentation area measurements. Digital orthophoto maps and digital terrain models by unmanned aerial vehicle were generated to characterise land use types and areas, slope gradients, and the distance from the land to the boundary of dam-land along the flow accumulation path. Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine the main factors affecting catchment erosion intensity. Results showed that the average sedimentation thickness and overall soil erosion intensity across the 12 catchments ranged from 0.16 to 1.67 m and 10295-49227 t km(-2), respectively. Soil erosion caused by the extreme rainstorm was 10-50 times of the soil loss tolerance on the Loess Plateau (1000 t km(-2) year(-1)). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the more similar the shape of a catchment to a circle, the closer the distance between the slope-cropland and dam-land, the larger the erosion modulus within the catchment. Furthermore, the presence of a cement road along the valley shoulder greatly reduced the modulus of soil erosion. These findings indicate that the existing ecological conditions in the dam-controlled catchments were not able to effectively resist erosion under the extreme rainfall conditions of this event. Thus, optimising the distribution of land use types within catchments should be a focus for soil erosion control.

A set of validated monthly GPP data from 1957 to 2010 in 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees grids of China was weighted from the Multi-scale Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project using Bayesian model averaging (BMA). The spatial anomalies of detrended BMA GPP during the growing seasons of typical El Nino years indicated that GPP response to El Nino varies with Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) phases: when the PDO was in the cool phase, it was likely that GPP was greater in northern China (32 degrees-38 degrees N, 111 degrees-122 degrees E) and less in the Yangtze River valley (28 degrees-32 degrees N, 111 degrees-122 degrees E); in contrast, when PDO was in the warm phase, the GPP anomalies were usually reversed in these two regions. The consistent spatiotemporal pattern and high partial correlation revealed that rainfall dominated this phenomenon. The previously published findings on how El Nino during different phases of PDO affecting rainfall in eastern China make the statistical relationship between GPP and El Nino in this study theoretically credible. This paper not only introduces an effective way to use BMA in grids that have mixed plant function types, but also makes it possible to evaluate the carbon cycle in eastern China based on the prediction of El Nino and PDO.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY												Shading can limit photosynthesis and plant growth. Understanding how phosphorus (P) application mitigates the effects of shading stress on morphology and physiology of mung beans (Vigna radiata L.) is of great significance for the establishment of efficient planting structures and optimizing P-use management. The effects of various light environments (non-shading stress, S0; low light stress, S1; severe shading stress, S2) on the growth of two mung bean cultivars (Xilv1 and Yulv1) and the role of P application (0 kg ha-1, P0; 90 kg ha-1, P1; 150 kg ha-1, P2) in such responses were investigated in a field experiment. Our results demonstrated that shading decreased the dry matter accumulation of mung bean markedly by limiting photosynthesis capacity and disrupting agro-nomic traits. For the leaf areas of the two cultivars, chlorophyll a+b, the net photosynthetic and electron transport rates were increased by 16.8%, 20.0%, 15.5%, and 12.5% under P1 treatment, and by 32.4%, 40.3%, 16.3% and 12.8% under P2 treatment, respectively, when compared to those for the non-fertilized plants under shading stress. These responses resulted in increased light capture and weak light utilization. Moreover, the activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were enhanced by 20.9% and 43.7%, respectively; malon-dialdehyde and superoxide anion contents were reduced by 18.6% and 14.1%, respectively, under P application. These findings suggest that P application moderately mitigates the damage caused by shading stress and en-hances tolerance by regulating mung bean growth. In addition, Xilv1 was more sensitive to P under shading stress than Yulv1.																			0981-9428	1873-2690				MAR	2023	196						1111	1121		10.1016/j.plaphy.2023.02.043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2023.02.043		MAR 2023						36931210					WOS:000955809700001

The benthic fauna assemblages associated with H. stipulacea in its native habitats and the potential effects of anthropogenic stressors on these assemblages remain unknown. We compared meadow characteristics, associated fauna assemblages and trophic niche structures of H. stipulacea from an impacted and a pristine site in the northern Red Sea. Seagrass cover and biomass were higher in the impacted site, however, the associated fauna community was more abundant and diverse in the pristine site. Both meadows showed comparable trophic niches based on stable isotope analysis. This study provides first insights into the macrozoobenthos associated with H. stipulacea in its native habitat and highlights the importance of better understanding the relationship between seagrasses and their associated biota and the potential effects of urbanization on this relationship.

This paper uses the daily rainfall derived from the satellite-based CHIRPS product on the GEE platform and Zhang's daily rainfall erosivity model to calculate the rainfall erosivity on the Loess Plateau during the period of 1981-2020. The accuracy of rainfall erosivity for the CHIRPS product is evaluated by comparing the results to estimates from national meteorological stations, and then the calculation formula of rainfall erosivity is optimized to improve the accuracy of rainfall erosivity based on CHIRPS products. The results show that the annual average rainfall of the CHIRPS product at the locations of national meteorological stations in 1981-2020 is 473.7 mm, which is 6.8% higher than that observed by the meteorological stations. The multi-year average value of daily rainfall and the yearly average rainfall both for days with rainfall larger than or equal to 12 mm are 15.9% and 18.2% greater than those of the meteorological stations, respectively, and eventually resulting in an overestimation of rainfall erosivity on the Loess Plateau by 44.0%. The annual mean rainfall erosivity interpolated based on meteorological stations and calculated from the gridded CHIRPS product in 1981-2020 is 1344.2 MJ center dot mm/(hm(2)center dot h) and 2013.7 MJ center dot mm/(hm(2)center dot h), respectively. This result suggests that rainfall erosivity estimated by gridded CHIRPS product is overestimated by 49.8%, of which 46.1% is due to the overestimation of erosive rainfall in gridded CHIRPS and 3.7% is caused by site density and interpolation. Satellite-based CHIRPS product is similar to the observations of meteorological stations in total rainfall and trends, but differs in rainfall frequency and intensity, which is an important reason for the difference in rainfall erosivity between satellite-based rainfall products and meteorological stations. The CHIRPS-based rainfall erosivity calculated using the optimized parameters reduces the overestimation from 49.8% to 3.2%, greatly reducing the satellite-based rainfall erosivity estimation error.

However, more research is needed on the hydrological effects of mulching in forest ecosystems under Mediterranean semi-arid conditions. This study has evaluated water infiltration, surface runoff and soil loss using a portable rainfall simulator in Central-Eastern Spain after post-fire treatments. In this area, a large wildfire recently affected a pine forest, and the burned soil was mulched using wheat straw (dose of 0.3 kg/m(2)) or wood chips (2 kg/m(2)) on plots with two different slopes (about 30%, lower slope, and 50%, higher slope). The study has shown that the soil condition (burned control vs. soils mulched with straw or wood chips) and slope (lower vs. higher) did not significantly influence the water infiltration. However, the mean infiltration of the soils mulched with straw were higher (+40% and + 17%, respectively) compared to both the control and the plots mulched with wood chips. Moreover, lower surface runoff (-23%) was measured in the mulched soils compared to the control plots. The soil mulching with straw was more effective at decreasing the runoff coefficient (-31%) compared to plots treated with wood chips (-18%) and the control areas. Soil loss was significantly lower in plots treated using straw (-87% compared to the burned and not treated soils) compared to wood chips (-54%). Peaks of 90-95% of reduction in the soil loss were even recorded in the steeper soils. Finally, we suggest the application of wheat straw rather than wood chips, since the wheat straw mulch material provides a higher soil cover (on average 73% against 48% of wood chips) and therefore is more indicated to reduce the hydrological response in burned soils, as confirmed by the lower runoff (in the average -16%) and erosion (-73%) measured in this experiment on both gentler and steeper soils.

Algorithms for weather-based management decisions in major rainfed crops of India: Validation using data from multi-location field experiments	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Crop weather calendars (CWC) serve as tools for taking crop management decisions. However, CWCs are not dynamic, as they were prepared by assuming normal sowing dates and fixed occurrence as well as duration of phenological stages of rainfed crops. Sowing dates fluctuate due to variability in monsoon onset and phenology varies according to crop duration and stresses encountered. Realizing the disadvantages of CWC for issuing accurate agromet advisories, a protocol of dynamic crop weather calendar (DCWC) was developed by All India Coordinated Research Project on Agrometeorology (AICRPAM). The DCWC intends to automatize agromet advisories using prevailing and forecasted weather. Different modules of DCWC, namely, Sowing & irrigation schedules, crop contingency plans, phenophase-wise crop advisory, and advisory for harvest were prepared using long-term data of ten crops at nine centers of AICRPAM in eight states in India. Modules for predicting sowing dates and phenology were validated for principal crops and varieties at selected locations. The predicted sowing dates of 10 crops pooled over nine centers showed close relationships with observed values (r(2) of .93). Predicted phenology showed better agreement with observed in all crops except cotton (Gossypium L.; at Parbhani) and pigeon pea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] (at Bangalore). Predicted crop phenology using forecasted and realized weather by DCWC are close to each other, but number of irrigations differed, and it failed for accurate prediction in groundnut at Anantapur in drought year (2014). The DCWCs require further validation for making it operational to issue agromet advisories in all 732 districts of India.

PLOS ONE												Genetic variations are a crucial source of germplasm heterogeneity, as they contribute to the development of new traits for plant breeding by offering an allele resource. Gamma rays have been widely used as a physical agent to produce mutations in plants, and their mutagenic effect has attracted much attention. Nonetheless, few studies have examined the whole mutation spectrum in large-scale phenotypic evaluations. To comprehensively investigate the mutagenic effects of gamma irradiation on lentils, biological consequences on the M-1 generation and substantial phenotypic screening on the M-2 generation were undertaken. Additionally, the study followed the selected mutants into the M-3 generation to evaluate the agronomic traits of interest for crop improvement. Seeds of lentil variety Moitree were irradiated with a range of acute gamma irradiation doses (0, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 Gy) to induce unique genetic variability. This research focused on determining the GR(50) value while considering seedling parameters and examining the status of pollen fertility while comparing the effects of the gamma irradiation dosages. The GR(50) value was determined to be 217.2 Gy using the seedling parameters. Pollens from untreated seed-grown plants were approximately 85% fertile, but those treated with the maximum dosage (350 Gy) were approximately 28% fertile. Numerous chlorophyll and morphological mutants were produced in the M-2 generation, with the 300 Gy -treated seeds being the most abundant, followed by the 250 Gy -treated seeds. This demonstrated that an appropriate dosage of gamma rays was advantageous when seeking to generate elite germplasm resources for one or multiple traits. Selected mutants in the M-3 generation showed improved agronomic traits, including plant height, root length, number of pods per plant, and yield per plant. These investigations will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the mutagenic effects and actions of gamma rays, providing a basis for the selection and design of suitable mutagens. This will facilitate the development of more controlled mutagenesis protocols for plant breeding and help guide future research directions for crop improvement using radiation-induced mutation breeding techniques.

Fire intensity locally impacts fuel consumption, damage to the vegetation, chemical composition of fire emissions and also how fires spread across landscapes. It has been observed that fire occurrence, defined as the frequency of active fires detected by the MODIS sensor, is related to intensity with a hump-shaped empirical relation, meaning that occurrence reaches a maximum at intermediate fire intensity. Raw burned area products obtained from remote sensing can not discriminate between ignition and propagation processes. To go beyond burned area and to test if fire size is driven by fire intensity at a global scale as expected from empirical fire spread models, we used the newly delivered global FRY database, which provides fire patch functional traits based on satellite observation, including fire patch size, and the fire radiative power measures from the MCD14ML dataset. This paper describes the varying relationships between fire size and fire radiative power across biomes at a global scale. We show that in most fire regions of the world defined by the GFED database, the linear relationship between fire radiative power and fire patch size saturates for a threshold of intermediate-intensity fires. The value of this threshold differs from one region to another and depends on vegetation type. In the most fire-prone savanna regions, once this threshold is reached, fire size decreases for the most intense fires, which mostly happen in the late fire season. According to the percolation theory, we suggest that the decrease in fire size for more intense late season fires is a consequence of the in-creasing fragmentation of fuel continuity throughout the fire season and suggest that landscape-scale feedbacks should be developed in global fire modules.

The Pulse Boundary Model method produces low velocity at short distances from the salt injection position. This study proposes a two-step approach to accurately estimate the flow velocity. Experiments were carried out under three flow rates of 12, 24, and 48 L min(-1) and three slope gradients of 4, 8, and 12 degrees at six measurement positions of 0.05, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.5 m from the solute injection positions. The new method obtains peak velocities that are 0.999 times those of the centroid velocities, indicating that either centroid or peak time can be equally used to measure flow velocity. The new method significantly improves measurement accuracy of flow velocity at short distances, as indicated by the almost equal measured velocities at all locations as those measured at longer distances. Velocities measured by the new method were significantly higher than those measured by the Pulse Boundary Model method or the centroid velocities measured by the traditional salt tracer method. In addition, the centroid and the peak velocities obtained by the new method correlates well to those by the traditional volumetric method. The velocities measured by the volumetric method were 0.79 (centroid velocity) and 0.78 (peak velocity) times of those estimated by the new and improved method. The results show that new and improved method provides an accurate and efficient approach in measuring shallow water flow velocity at short distances.

This is especially so in strongly contrasting and degraded regions such as the Horn of Africa. Machine learning algorithms such as random forests (RF) offer great potential to deal with the complex, often non-linear, nature of factors controlling gully erosion. Nonetheless, their applicability at regional to continental scales remains largely untested. Moreover, such algorithms require large amounts of observations for model training and testing. Collecting such data remains an important bottleneck. Here we help to address these gaps by developing and testing a methodology to simulate gully densities across Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti (total area: 1.2 million km(2)). We propose a methodology to quickly assess the gully head density (GHD) for representative 1 km(2)study sites by visually scoring the presence of gullies in Google Earth and then converting these scores to realistic estimates of GHD. Based on this approach, we compiled GHD observations for 1,700 sites. We used these data to train sets of RF regression models that simulate GHD at a 1 km(2)resolution, based on topographic/geomorphic, land cover, soil and rainfall conditions. Our approach also accounts for uncertainties in GHD observations. Independent validations showed generally acceptable simulations of regional GHD patterns. We further show that: (i) model performance strongly depends on the amount of training data used, (ii) large prediction errors mainly occur in areas where also the predicted uncertainty is large and (iii) collecting additional training data for these areas results in more drastic model performance improvements. Analyses of the feature importance of predictor variables further showed that patterns of GHD across the Horn of Africa strongly depend on NDVI and annual rainfall, but also on normalized steepness index (k(sn)) and distance to rivers. Overall, our work opens promising perspectives to assess gully densities at continental scales. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Five salinity levels of irrigation water were set up: 1.3, 5.4, 8.8, 12.4 and 15.9 dS m?(1). Cotton evapotranspiration increased first and then decreased with increasing salinity of irrigation water. Soil EC(e)within the cotton root zone at each stage increased with greater salinity of irrigation water. After a 2-year experiment soil desalination occurred in the main root layer (top 0-60 cm soil layer) when water salinity was less than 8.8 dS m?(1). The significant (p < 0.05) decline of seedling establishment rate and seed cotton yield only occurred in 15.9 dS m?(1) treatment in 2017 when saline water was drip irrigated right after sowing. Leaf area index and plant height were inhibited when irrigation water salinity was more than 12.4 dS m?(1) in both years. Additionally, saline water irrigation had little effect on fibre quality. To avoid a secondary salinization risk in this region, water with the salinity level of <= 8.8 dS m?(1) was recommended under drip irrigation. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Evaluation of the APEX cattle weight gain component for grazing decision-support in the Western Great Plains	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Rotational grazing studies have produced mixed results related to animal performance (weight gain), which has contributed to producer uncertainty regarding grazing management decisions. To enhance decision-support for producers, we improved algorithms in the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model to better represent cattle weight gain in real-world rangeland conditions under two grazing management strategies. Simulated weight gain and related forage effects were evaluated with experimental data from 2014 to 2018 under two grazing strategies. The traditional rangeland management strategy used continuous season-long grazing stocked at a moderate level. The collaborative adaptive rangeland management strategy employed grazing with one large herd rotated using a sequence developed by a stakeholder group with movement between pastures driven by predetermined decision triggers. For each grazing strategy, yearling steers grazed from mid-May to October on ten 130-ha pastures. With the APEX modifications, daily weight gain was adequately simulated for both continuous (traditional rangeland management) grazing and management intensive rotational (collaborative adaptive rangeland management) grazing. Dry matter intake, total digestible nutrients, and temporal distribution of dry matter intake were the primary influencers of cattle performance (weight gain). Once shown to be accurate, we used APEX to evaluate several management alternatives (i.e., stocking rate, rotation interval, and rotation decision criteria) to showcase its decision support capabilities. These important enhancements increase the utility of APEX in semiarid environments, such as the western Great Plains, in providing science-based rangeland decision support to ranchers, agency land managers, and policy makers.

The heterogeneity of Ni bioavailability and toxicity of Prorocentrum donghaiense influenced by DOM fractions incubated in urea was investigated in this study. On the occasion, chlorophyll (Chl a) concentration, growth rate, and photosynthesis parameters were monitored to track changes occurring in the test organism. Chl a concentration and photosynthesis parameters in the treatment of hydrophilic DOM (HPI) with Ni-free was significantly higher than that in the control treatment, and similar data were shown in the treatment of hydrophobic DOM(HPO)with the low Ni environment (0.17 mu mol L-1). However, the opposite phenomena were observed in the treatments of HPO with the higher Ni environment (over 170 mu mol L-1). Moreover, the EC50 of Ni for P.donghaiense incubated in HPO was relatively lower than that in HPI and control treatment, which implied that HPO elevated the toxicity of Ni. Therefore, the varied DOM compositions because of different origins, as a chelating agent and potential nutrient source in coastal waters, shows the significantly different bioavailability and toxicity of Ni with the increasing inputs of urea, which in turn influences the dy-namics of phytoplankton.					黄, 旭/JFJ-8744-2023; Huang, Xu/HOH-0307-2023														0147-6513	1090-2414				SEP 15	2022	243								114017	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.114017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.114017		AUG 2022						36027715					WOS:000850890800001

Jujube (Ziziphus jujube Mill. CV. Lizao) plantations have been planted to improve the economic income since 2000. In order to prevent soil drying and sustain artificial plantation development, we examined the relationships between the canopy size, water consumption, and water use efficiency in a dry land jujube plantation. Methods: Seven treatments were tested comprising native jujube with no pruning and dwarfing jujube under different pruning levels ranging from 1 to 6. Jujube is a popular dwarfing canopy type in this region with a tree height of 2.2 m and this comprised level 1. Jujube received increased intensities of pruning as well as decreases in tree height and canopy size for levels 2-4. Jujube received severe pruning to a tree height of only 1.1 m at level 5, and the canopy was removed with only 30-40 cm of the trunk left for level 6. Soil water was detected using CNC100 neutron tubes. A thermal diffusion probe was used to monitor the sap flow in jujube trees throughout the whole growth period. Results: During our study period, 2014 was a wet year with rainfall of 460.4 mm and 2015 was a dry year with rainfall of only 380.8 mm. Transpiration and water consumption by jujube decreased significantly whereas the soil water content increased as the pruning intensity increased in these two years. Compared with 15-year-old native jujube, the annual soil water consumption by 15-year-old dwarfing jujube (pruned at level 1) was 6.54 mm less and the soil water consumption depth moved upward by 2.2 m. The soil water recovered faster for jujube at level 6 and the soil water restoration depth reached 4.6 m after 3 years, with an annual restoration depth of 153.3 cm. Compared with level 1 jujube, at level 5, the height was halved, the transpiration was about 22.1%, and the water use efficiency was significantly improved by 1.1 times, thereby demonstrating that the water consumption could be regulated by the canopy size. Level 2 jujube had the highest water use efficiency with the optimal pruning level in the local region. Conclusions: We found that pruning could effectively decrease water consumption, relieve deep soil drying, and improve the water use efficiency in jujube. The pruning level should be determined based on the water consumption rate and average rainfall to obtain high yields.

Thus, one can hypothesize that the scale-components of species diversity and drivers' diversity match, i.e., that species alpha diversity is mainly explained by drivers' alpha diversity, beta by beta and gamma by gamma. Here, we explore this scale-matching' hypothesis for spiders in two fragmented agricultural landscapes. In each landscape, we sampled spiders and their potential prey in 12 patches. Then, we sub-sampled pseudo-landscapes in which we calculated spider alpha, beta and gamma diversities using multiplicative diversity-partitioning. Next, we used variance partitioning analysis to explore the relative contribution of eleven explanatory variables from five thematic groups (sampling intensity, area, connectivity, habitat diversity and prey diversity), while further partitioning the habitat and prey diversities to their corresponding alpha, beta and gamma diversities. We found considerable evidence for scale-matching, with spiders' alpha and beta diversities explained mostly by the corresponding alpha and beta diversities (respectively) of prey and/or habitat. We further found a strong effect of connectivity on spider beta diversity, but not on alpha and gamma diversities. For spiders gamma diversity, a cross-scale effect was observed. Our results suggest that multiple drivers from multiple scales interact in structuring patterns of spider alpha, beta and gamma diversities in agro-ecosystems, yet the strongest effects are of those drivers that match in scale.

However, evaluating the spatio-temporal distributions and driving factors of the SM changes following afforestation is challenging because of the difficulty of accessing areas and the lack of long-term series records. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) SM product by comparing with in-situ SM data in LPC, and quantified the spatio-temporal variations of SM in different periods from 1982 to 2015 under the 'Grain for Green' program (GGP). The results showed that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was well matched with the SM variations in more than 46% area of LPC from 1982 to 2015, which mainly located at the vegetated areas. The variations of SM responding to re vegetation displayed obvious southeast-negative and northwest-positive patterns, which was the wet region (annual precipitation > 450 mm) to be dry and dry region (annual precipitation <= 450 mm) to be wet. Path coefficient value revealed that the positive effect of vegetation activity for grassland on SM was ascribed to its promotion on the occurrence of rainfall (mean path coefficient = 0.278). Precipitation played vital impact on the SM in bareland and sparsely vegetated area, and evapotranspiration played a dominant role in the SM dynamic of the forestland, especially at the early stage of GGP (From 2000 to 2010), while precipitation and NDVI had stronger effects than evapotranspiration on the SM dynamics of grassland. Our study suggests that in arid and semi-arid areas, vegetation achieves the optimal water retention capacity when the vegetation fractions are 1.4%-3.7% and 3.8%-7.2%, respectively. Hence, vegetation should not be further expanded in semi-humid areas, but should be further restored in arid and semi-arid areas with sparse or excessively sparse vegetation cover (especially in desert).

J	Parlasca, MC; Musshoff, O; Qaim, M				Parlasca, Martin C.; Musshoff, Oliver; Qaim, Matin			Can mobile phones improve nutrition among pastoral communities? Panel data evidence from Northern Kenya	AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS												The digital revolution and the ongoing dissemination of mobile phones carry several prospects for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Food insecurity and low dietary quality remain major issues among African smallholders. Mobile phones could potentially facilitate access to food markets and thus improve food security and nutrition, but research on such types of effects remains scarce. In this study, we analyze whether mobile phones improve dietary quality among pastoral communities in Northern Kenya. We use six rounds of household panel data covering the period between 2009 and 2015. During this period, mobile phone ownership in the sample increased from less than 30% to more than 70%. Regression models with household fixed effects allow robust estimation while reducing potential issues of unobserved heterogeneity. The estimates show that mobile phone adoption and use are positively and significantly associated with dietary diversity. The effects are particularly large for frequent mobile phone users. We also examine the underlying mechanisms. Mobile phone use improves dietary diversity mainly through better access to purchased foods. These results encourage the promotion of mobile phone technologies as a valuable tool for nutritional improvements, especially in remote rural settings with poor access to food markets.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the desertification process and its driving factors accurately and objectively, and compare the differences of desertification process in different areas. We used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface albedo (MCD43A3) and leaf area index (LAI) (MCD15A2H) products to calculate the desertification divided index (DDI) to reveal the spatial-temporal variation regularity of the four sandy lands in northern China during 2000?2017 as well as the correlation between desertification and precipitation. The results showed that the total desertification degree of sandy lands in northern China showed a downward trend during the study period. By grading the desertification level, it was found the decline trend of severe desertification and high desertification was relatively significant (p?<?0.05). The spatial trend of the desertification level in sandy lands was significantly different, and the decreased area of severe desertification and high desertification in Mu Us sandy land was the largest (?0.042???10(4)?km(2) yr(?1) and ?0.052???10(4)?km(2) yr(?1)), while the interannual variation of the various desertification levels in Hulun Buir sandy land was small (?0.003???10(4)?km(2) yr(?1)). The precipitation and DDI were positively correlated in most areas (p?<?0.05). Especially in Mu Us sandy land and Hunshandake sandy land, the proportional area of positive correlation between the precipitation and DDI was more prominent, accounting for 72.9% and 63.7%, respectively. This study had important decision-making significance for the effective management of sandy lands in arid/semiarid areas.

Different ecological factors have been shown to affect species distribution depending on the scale of analysis, whether regional or local. The interplay between local and regional factors in explaining the spatial distribution of cave-dwelling organisms is poorly understood. Using the troglophilic subterranean spider Artema nephilit (Araneae: Pholcidae) as a model organism, we investigated whether similar environmental predictors drive the species distribution at these two spatial scales. At the local scale, we monitored the abundance of the spiders and measured relevant environmental features in 33 caves along the Jordan Rift Valley. We then extended the analysis to a regional scale, investigating the drivers of the distribution using species distribution models. We found that similar ecological factors determined the distribution at both local and regional scales for A. nephilit. At a local scale, the species was found to preferentially occupy the outermost, illuminated, and warmer sectors of caves. Similarly, mean annual temperature, annual temperature range, and solar radiation were the most important drivers of its regional distribution. By investigating these two spatial scales simultaneously, we showed that it was possible to achieve an in-depth understanding of the environmental conditions that governs subterranean species distribution.

As recommended by the FAIR principles, data, labels, and metadata must use controlled vocabularies and ontologies that are popular in the knowledge domain and commonly used by the community. Despite the existence of robust ontologies in the Life Sciences, there is currently no comprehensive full set of ontologies recommended for data annotation across agricultural research disciplines. In this paper, we discuss the added value of the Ontologies Community of Practice (CoP) of the CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture for harnessing relevant expertise in ontology development and identifying innovative solutions that support quality data annotation. The Ontologies CoP stimulates knowledge sharing among stakeholders, such as researchers, data managers, domain experts, experts in ontology design, and platform development teams.

However, little is known about rainfall-related soil moisture dynamics in arid high-altitude mountainous areas due to the absence of long-term high-resolution soil moisture observations. In this study, we investigated the dynamic response processes of profile soil moisture using data from a soil moisture monitoring network in the Qilian Mountains established in 2013 covering altitudes from 2,000-5,000 m a.s.l. To investigate the effects of different land covers on soil moisture response, we selected data from eight soil moisture stations with the same soil textural class and slope, but different land covers (scrubland, meadow, high coverage grassland (HCG), medium coverage grassland (MCG) and barren land). Several indices were evaluated to quantitatively describe soil moisture dynamics during the growing seasons of 2014-2016 based on soil wetting events. In addition, HYDRUS-1D simulations were used to further analyze the effect of land cover on soil moisture dynamics. Our results showed that soil moisture response amplitudes along profile are similar under MCG and barren land, but significantly different under scrubland, meadow and HCG. The rate of soil moisture increment decreased significantly with depth for all land covers, except for the HCG. The temporal pattern of soil moisture increase was highly variable along the soil profiles depending on land cover type. In particular, the difference of response time between the adjacent layers varied from negative values to 280 h with depth. Preferential flow occurred mostly in soils covered by scrubland. Water transferability was higher in deeply rooted soil. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis indicated that soil hydraulic properties are key factors in regulating profile soil wetting events. Our results show that the soil moisture response indices are useful to quantitatively characterize patterns in profile soil moisture dynamics, and provide new insights into the soil moisture profile wetting process (e.g. occurrence of preferential flow etc.), which helps for effective model parameterization and validation, in turn improving hydrological modelling in arid high-altitude mountainous areas.

J	Yang, JH; Wu, GL; Jiao, JY; Dyck, M; He, HL				Yang, Jiahui; Wu, Gaolin; Jiao, Juying; Dyck, Miles; He, Hailong			Freeze-thaw induced landslides on grasslands in cold regions	CATENA												Landslides induced by freeze-thaw processes on grasslands are one of the major geohazards, and their scale and frequency are increasing as the global warms. Freeze-thaw induced landslides degrade surface vegetation and soil properties, reduce biodiversity, intensify landscape fragmentation, and lead to losses in economy, human and animal lives. Despite substantial progress in research on landslides, there has been little study focused on how ground freeze-thaw events affect landslides. By critically analyzing previous studies, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for the forms and types, development, dominant factors, monitoring techniques, and impact mechanisms of freeze-thaw induced landslides. Landslides are controlled by soil characteristics and topographic slope, which are major intrinsic determinants. Increased rainfall, rising temperatures, and thickening active layer due to climate change are all direct drivers of freeze-thaw induced landslides. Vegetation conditions, animal behavior interference, and wind erosion all affect the occurrence and development process of landslides by modifying vegetation cover, soil physical and chemical properties, and structure. Currently, landslide monitoring techniques have evolved rapidly with improved efficiency and accuracy, but with only few applications for freeze-thaw induced landslides. There are a variety of prediction models for landslides, but few consider freeze-thaw effects and lack field validation. The new perspective on the occurring types and dominant factors enhances theoretical understanding of the formation mechanisms, which helps further monitor and analysis of freeze-thaw induced landslides. Future studies should concentrate on the coupling mechanism of multiple factors and the development of an accurate prediction system, which will greatly benefit the understanding and early detection of freeze-thaw induced landslides.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2022	219								106650	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106650	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106650		SEP 2022											WOS:000864646700004

The objective of this study was to investigate the role and the effect of subsurface water level change on gully headcut retreat, gully formation and expansion in high rainfall tropical regions in the Ethiopian highlands. During the rainy seasons of 2017-2019, the expansion rate of 16 fixed gullies was measured and subsurface water levels were measured by piezometers installed near gully heads. During the study period, headcut retreats ranged from 0.70 to 2.35 m, with a mean value of 1.49 +/- 0.56 m year(-1), and average depth of the surface water level varied between 1.12 and 2.82 m, with a mean value of 2.62 m. Gully cross-section areas ranged from 2.90 to 20.90 m(2), with an average of 9.31 +/- 4.80 m(2). Volumetric retreat of gully headcuts ranged from 4.49 to 40.55 m(3) and averaged 13.34 +/- 9.10 m(3). Soil loss from individual gullies ranged from 5.79 to 52.31 t year(-1) and averaged 17.21 +/- 11.74 t year(-1). The headcut retreat rate and sediment yield were closely related over the three study seasons. Elevated subsurface water levels facilitated the slumping of gully banks and heads, causing high sediment yield. When the soil was saturated, bank collapse and headcut retreat were favoured by the combination of elevated subsurface water and high rainfall. This study indicates that area exclosures are effective in controlling subsurface water level, thus reducing gully headcut retreat and associated soil loss.

J	Mao, N; Li, WR; Wei, XR; Shao, MA				Mao, Na; Li, Wenrao; Wei, Xiaorong; Shao, Ming'an			Soil moisture- and texture-dependent effects of soil deposition on evaporation and carbon emission	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Soil erosion drives water and nutrient redistribution among landscape positions and thus global biogeochemical cycles. However, large uncertainties remain in the effects of deposition after erosion on soil hydrological and nutrient turnover, hindering precise assessment of global water and nutrient budgets. Herein, we presented the results of soil evaporation and carbon (C) emission measurements in a 19-day simulated depositional experiment at standard temperature (25 degrees C). A homogeneous soil treatment was designed as a control to assess the effects of deposition. Three soils (Ultisol, Mollisol and Entisol) varying in texture and organic matter content were used, and two soil moisture conditions (drying and wetting) were included to examine the interactions of soil texture and moisture with deposition. Soil macropores were measured using X-ray tomography at the end of the simulation experiment to relate the soil structure to evaporation and C emission. We hypothesized that the deposition of soil after erosion will increase evaporation and C emission and that such effects are regulated by the soil texture and moisture conditions. The depositional soils had greater macropore numbers (8/cm(3)), macroporosity (0.61 %/cm(3)), connectivity density (0.91/cm(3)), cumulative evaporation (332.92 g) and C emission (2.46 g kg(-1)) than the homogeneous soils (1/cm(3), 0.05 %/cm(3), 0.02/cm(3), 303.35 g, and 1.95 g kg(-1), respectively). The effect of deposition on macropores was greater under drying condition than under wetting condition and was greater in the Mollisol than in the Ultisol and Entisol. The effects of deposition on evaporation dynamics varied with soil moisture conditions regardless of soil texture, with less effect under drying condition but increased evaporation under wetting condition. The deposition increased C emission under both drying and wetting conditions for the Ultisol and Entisol, but its impact on the Mollisol varied with the soil moisture treatment, with increased C emission under drying condition but decreased C emission under wetting condition. These results suggested that the effects of deposition are regulated by the soil texture and moisture and that the development of macropores due to shrinkage in depositional soils increased soil water loss and carbon decomposition, which might decrease C sequestration potential in deposition sites.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				OCT	2020	204								104703	10.1016/j.still.2020.104703	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.104703													WOS:000580938500006
J	Ci, ZJ; Peng, F; Xue, X; Zhang, XS				Ci, Zhijia; Peng, Fei; Xue, Xian; Zhang, Xiaoshan			Permafrost Thaw Dominates Mercury Emission in Tibetan Thermokarst Ponds	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Increasing evidence shows that warming is driving Hg release from the cryosphere. However, Hg cycling in thawing permafrost is less understood to date. Here we show that permafrost thaw dominantly supplied no-run thermokarst ponds by permafrost melt waters (PMWs) with high concentration of photoreducible Hg (PRHg) and subsequently controlled Hg(0) emissions in the Tibetan Plateau. This study was motivated by field survey suggesting that thermokarst ponds as recipient aquatic systems of PMWs could be an active converter of PRHg to Hg(0). Annual Hg mass balance in three seasonally ice-covered thermokarst ponds suggests that PMWs were the dominant input (81.2% to 91.2%) of PRHg in all three thermokarst ponds, and PRHg input would be a constraint of Hg(0) emission owing to the fast photoreduction of PRHg to Hg(0) in the water column. Annual Hg(0) emission in the thermokarst ponds of study region was conservatively estimated to increase by 15% over the past half century. Our findings highlight that climate-induced landscape disturbances and changes in hydrogeochemical processes in climate-sensitive permafrost will quickly and in situ drive Hg stored in permafrost for a very long time into the modern day Hg cycle, which potentially offsets the anthropogenic Hg mitigation policies.

We investigated the morphological characteristics of gullies, the topographic thresholds of gully formation, and estimated headcut retreat rates in three agro-ecologies of the Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia: highland (Guder), midland (Aba Gerima), and lowland (Dibatie). Gully morphological characteristics were analyzed using data measured in the field, whereas the topographic thresholds were estimated using slope and upslope drainage area. Average annual linear (R-l) and volumetric (V-e) headcut retreat rates were estimated by visual interpretation of very high resolution (0.5-1.5 m) satellite images (QuickBird, IKONOS, SPOT-7, and Pleiades) in a GIS environment. A significant power relationship, fitted between gully volume (V) and length (L) for the three sites, is V = 8.097 L-1.032 (R-2 = 0.902, n = 94). The average annual R-l, V-e, and soil loss rates were estimated at 0.76 m yr(-1), 6.77 m(3) yr(-1), and 8.73 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in Guder, 2.09 m yr(-1), 19.58 m(3) yr(-1), and 20.76 t ha(-)1 yr(-1) in Aba Gerima, and 3.42 m yr(-1), 42.16 m(3) yr(-1), and 49.33 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in Dibatie. The higher gully headcut retreat rate in Dibatie is mainly related to the highly erodible nature of Vertisols. The coefficients of the slope (S)-drainage area (A) relationship S = aA(-b) were a = 0.219 and b = -0.139 in Guder, a = 0.133 and b = -0.234 in Aba Gerima, and a = 0.113 and b = -0.216 in Dibatie, indicating that topographic thresholds for gully initiation varied among the agro-ecologies. The results of this study can be used to estimate gully erosion rates and identify areas for gully initiation, thereby supporting the planning of appropriate gully control measures in the study sites and other areas with similar environmental settings.

Crop modelling can help inform the improvement of agricultural productivity under future climate. This study applies the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to assessing the impacts of projected climate change on two (early and medium maturing) sorghum varieties under different management practices. Results show high model accuracy with excellent agreement between simulated and observed values for crop phenology and leaf number per plant. The prediction of grain yield and total biomass of an early maturing variety was fair RMSEn (22.9 and 23.1%), while that of the medium maturing was highly accurate RMSEn (14.9 and 11.9%). Sensitivity analysis performed by changing the calibrated variables of key plant traits in the model, showed higher significant yield change by + or - 10 % changed in radiation use efficiency, (RUE), coefficient extinction (Coeff_ext) and Phyllocron (Phyllo) for early maturing variety while + or - 10 % changed in phyllochron and RUE showed a significant yield change for the medium maturing variety. Under climate change scenerios using RCP 8.5, the simulated yield for the early-maturing variety revealed high inter-annual variability and potential yield loss of 3.3% at Bamako and 1% at Kano in the near-future (2010-2039) compared to baseline (1980-2009). The mid-century (2040-2069) projected yield decline by 4.8% at Bamako and 6.2% at Kano compared to baseline (1980-2009). On the contrary, the medium maturing variety indicated significantly yield gain with high yielding potential in both climate regimes compared to the baseline period (1980-2009). The simulated grain yield increased by 7.2% at Bamako and 4.6% at Kano, in the near-future (2010-2039) while in the mid-century (2040-2069) projected yield increase of 12.3% and 2% at Bamako and Kano compared to baseline (1980-2009). Adaptation strategies under climate change for varying sowing dates in the near-future (2010-2039, indicated that June sowing had a higher positive yield gained over July and August sowing for early maturing variety; July sowing simulated positive gained by 5-11% over June and August sowing for medium maturing variety in both locations. Similarly, under the mid-century (2040-2069), among the sowing dates and in both locations, June sowing indicates lowest negative yield change over July and August sowing for early maturing variety. However, for medium maturing variety, July sowing had the highest yield gain of 16% over June and August sowing at Bamako and June highest positive yield gained of 11.4% over July and August at Kano. Our study has, therefore, demonstrated the capacity of APSIM model as a tool for testing management, plant traits practices and adoption of improved variety for enhancing the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers under climate change in the Sudanian zone of West Africa. This approach offers a promising option to design more resilient and productive farming systems for West Africa using the diverse sorghum gennplasm available in the region.

Allan; Kang, Shichang; Sajjad, Wasim; Shang, Zhanhuan			Diversity, distribution, and function of bacteria in the supraglacial region hit by glacial lake outburst flood in northern Pakistan	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE												Background Glaciers of the Hindu Kush region are highly susceptible to climate change. Recently, a severe glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) hit the supraglacial region at the frontier of Dook Pal Glacier. Information on the bacterial community in a freshly appeared supraglacial lake after GLOF is essential to probe the bacterial distribution pattern after immediate unlocking from the supraglacial region. After GLOF, geochemistry and bacterial diversity, distribution, community structure, and function were examined in the lake-debris and melt-water. Results In general, concentrations of dissolved free amino acids were similar between lake-debris and melt-water, potentially toxic elements and cations were greater in lake-debris, and anions concentrations were greater in melt-water. In addition, there was comparable diversity in the glacial melt-water and lake-debris; Proteobacteria dominated in lake-debris (33.1-94.5%), while Proteobacteria (36.7-50.5%) and Firmicutes (44-62%) dominated in melt-water. It is more likely that Proteobacteria and Firmicutes shifted towards melt-water after GLOF, creating an uneven distribution of communities in the lake-debris; however, a relatively even distribution was maintained in melt-water. Genes responsible for metabolism and energy production were higher in lake-debris than in melt-water bacteria; whereas, genes for other cellular mechanisms were higher in melt-water than in lake-debris bacteria. Conclusions This study offers valuable datasets in understanding the bacterial diversity, distribution and function as a consequence of GLOF at the glacial frontier.

They play several important roles, including that of water sources and forage grounds for people and their livestock. Considering high variation in micro-relief and complexity of water supplies observed in these wetlands, we assessed their potential to play a role of refugia for species whose present ranges may be limited by climate changes projected for Central Asia. Such species currently occur typically in less moist habitats, often located at lower elevations (e. g. steppe and meadow species). To perform this assessment, we analyzed current spatial structure and species diversity of vegetation accompanying selected water bodies in the studied catchments, identified present changes in temperature and precipitation in these catchments and analyzed alterations in area of lakes and small water bodies located in the vegetation mosaic. Presently, the biodiversity of the studied wetlands comprises 110 species of vascular plants from 26 families, forming ten distinct vegetation types, over 40 recorded species are typical for steppes and various types of alpine meadows. Both meteorological data and satellite data on open water area indicated that with growing temperatures, areas of the studied lakes and small water bodies in the vegetation mosaic increase. This effect is probably caused by thawing of ground ice and permafrost, whose occurrence helps mitigate the effects of the ongoing warming and lessening precipitation. Thus, the wetlands may temporarily maintain their cold, wet and mesic characteristics under the changing climatic conditions and, as such, poten-tially become refugia for steppe and meadow species. However, after the period of intense thawing, lowering of groundwater level and huge surface water fluctuations may occur, potentially resulting in a decrease in the total vegetated area on lacustrine and riverine terraces in the Eastern Pamir.

Quantifying geostatistical properties of <SUP>137</SUP>Cs and <SUP>210</SUP>Pb<sub>ex</sub> at small scales for improving sampling design and soil erosion estimation	GEODERMA												Knowledge of spatial structures of the radionuclides Cs-137 and unsupported (210)pb ((210)pb(ex)) is vital for developing sound sampling designs that are crucial for deriving quantitative soil erosion estimates. The objectives are to characterize spatial structures of Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex) inventories at small spatial scales under different land uses, and to quantify the effects of core sizes on (1) estimated sample means and variances of the Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex) inventories and (2) sample numbers required for estimating the mean inventories at a given confidence level. Three different core sizes were used to take soil samples along three 10-m transects at 0.25-m or 0.5-m intervals for each land use. Land uses included cropland, grassland, forestland, and rangeland. 330 samples were analyzed for Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex) inventories. Semivariograms were obtained by plotting empirical semivariances with sample separation distances. The spatial correlation distances ranged from 0.2 to 0.75 m for most cases. The semivariances at the separation distances of > 0.75 m were close to the variances of the fields for all four land uses, indicating that the spatial distributions of Cs-137 and Pb-210(ex) were nearly stationary and had little spatial dependence at scales between 0.75 and 5 m. The overall results suggested that samples taken at a separation distance of > 0.75 m would be largely independent and could be composited to form a representative sample for the sampling location for most cases. Given the large spatial variability at such a small scale, quantitative soil erosion rates cannot be estimated for a single soil core, because remarkably different soil erosion rates can be estimated for soil cores taken within a meter. Core size variation between 38 mm and 86 mm has no apparent effect on estimating sample means and sample standard deviations of Cs-137 and (210)pb(ex) inventories, except for gravely soils. In general, 15-30 samples are needed to estimate Cs-137 reference inventory on reference sites, but may be more for gravely soils. More samples are required for forest and cultivated sites than for uncultivated grassland sites. On measuring sites, it is strongly recommended that 5-15 samples be taken for a grid point and measured individually if feasible or as a combined sample to allow reliable estimation of the mean Cs-137 inventory for the location for most soils and land uses. If samples are taken for each of uniformly eroded land form units, the same number of individual samples as on the reference site are recommended. This work will be useful to improving sampling designs and consequently the accuracy of soil erosion estimation of the Cs-137 technique.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and nitric oxide (NO), as messenger molecules, participated in the regulation of plant physiological processes. Here, we studied the interaction effects of H2S and NO on the adaptation to Fe deficiency in Glycine max L. Physio-logical, biochemical and molecular approaches were conducted to analyze the role of H2S and NO in regulating the adaptation to Fe deficiency in soybean. We found that H2S and NO had obvious rescuing function on the Fe deficiency-induced the plant growth inhibition, which was significantly correlated with the increase in Fe content in the leaves, stems, and roots of soybean. Meanwhile, H+-flux, ferric chelate reductase (FCR) activity, and root apoplast Fe content were significantly affected by H2S and NO. Under Fe deficiency conditions NO and H2S regulated the expression of genes related to Fe homeostasis. Moreover, photosynthesis (Pn) and photosystem II (PSII) efficiency were enhanced by H2S and NO, and thiol redox modification was important for regulating the adaptation of Fe deficiency. The aforementioned affirmative influences caused by H2S and NO were also totally reversed by cPTIO (a NO scavenger). Our results suggested that H2S might act upstream of NO in response to Fe deficiency by affecting the Fe homeostasis enzyme activities and gene expression, and by promoting Fe accu-mulation in plant tissues as well as by enhancing thiol redox modification and photosynthesis in soybean plants.																			0981-9428	1873-2690				JAN 1	2023	194						1	14		10.1016/j.plaphy.2022.11.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2022.11.003		NOV 2022						36368221					WOS:000895736600001

This has strong implications for people's livelihoods when agriculture is the backbone of the economy. We assessed the effect of the Tigray conflict on farming activities using freely available remote sensing data. For detecting greenness, a normalized difference vegetation Index (NDVI) was analyzed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Sentinel 2 satellite images acquired in the pre-war (2020) and during war (2021) spring seasons. CHIRPS data were analyzed in GEE to understand the rainfall conditions. The NDVI of 2020 showed that farmlands were poorly covered with vegetation. However, in 2021, vegetation cover existed in the same season. The NDVI changes stretched from - 0.72 to 0.83. The changes in greenness were categorized as increase (2167 km(2)), some increase (18,386 km(2)), no change (1.6 km(2)), some decrease (8269 km(2)), and decrease (362 km(2)). Overall, 72% of the farmlands have seen increases in green vegetation before crops started to grow in 2021. Scattered patches with decreases in vegetation cover correspond to irrigation farms and spring-cropping rain-fed farms uncultivated in 2021. There was no clear pattern of changes in vegetation cover as a function of agro-climatic conditions. The precipitation analysis shows less rainfall in 2021 as compared to 2020, indicating that precipitation has not been an important factor. The conflict is most responsible for fallowing farmlands covered with weeds in the spring season of 2021. The use of freely accessible remote sensing data helps recognizing absence of ploughing in crisis times.

In order to improve the accuracy and universality of daily R-s prediction in arid Northwest China, back-propagation neural network (BP) and BP optimized by the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-BP) along with six statistical models (angstrom ngstrom-Prescott, Bristow-Campbell, Swartman-Ogunlade, Sebaii, Chen and Abdalla) were adopted and compared with measured R-s data from eight representative meteorological stations across four sub-climatic zones, including the temperate continental arid zone, temperate continental high temperature-arid zone, plateau continental semi-arid zone and temperate monsoon semi-arid zone. The results showed that PSO-BP models (coefficient of determination, R-2, 0.7649-0.9678) were more accurate than BP models (R-2, 0.7215-0.9632) and statistical models (R-2, 0.5630-0.9445) for the daily R-s prediction in the four sub-zones of arid Northwest China. The PSO-BP1 and BP1 models (with sunshine duration, maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity and extraterrestrial radiation as inputs), PSO-BP2 and BP2 (with sunshine duration, maximum and minimum temperature and extraterrestrial radiation as inputs) performed better than the other models, with R-2, mean absolute error, root mean square error, relative root mean square error and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient ranging 0.9228-0.9678, 1.5546-1.6309 MJ.m(-2).d(-1), 2.0054-1.7579 MJ.m(-2).d(-1), 0.1517-0.1329 and 0.9017-0.9604, respectively, among which the PSO-BP1 model provided the most accurate results. Sunshine-based models (R-2, 0.7533-0.9678) were generally superior to temperature-based models (R-2, 0.5630-0.8492), which indicated that sunshine duration was more influential for daily R-s prediction than temperature in this area. Overall, the PSO-BP model exhibits the best generalization capability and is recommended for more accurate daily R-s prediction in arid Northwest China.

M.; Yu, Qiang; Su, Zhongbo			Seasonal variation and controlling factors of evapotranspiration over dry semi-humid cropland in Guanzhong Plain, China	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The Guanzhong Plain is a critical food production area in the Yellow River Basin that frequently suffers from water shortages. In this study, long-term (June 2013 to June 2018) water and energy fluxes were observed, and path analysis was conducted over an irrigated winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) / summer maize (Zea mays L.) rotation field to identify the controlling factors of evapotranspiration (ET). Total ET for each crop year ranged from 627 to 775 mm, with an average growing season ET of 398 mm for wheat and 310 mm for maize. There is significant seasonal variation in both ET and surface conductance (Gs). Daily ET varied from 0.0 to 6.0 mm d-1 for wheat and 0.0 to 6.7 mm d-1 for maize. The peak daily values of Gs were 29.5 mm s-1 for wheat and 19.5 mm s-1 for maize. The direct and indirect effects of environmental and biological factors-net radiation (Rn), surface conductance (Gs), saturation vapor pressure deficit (VPD), leaf area index (LAI), air temperature (Tair), and volumetric soil water content (VWC)-on ET were calculated using the path analysis method. Rn was determined to be the primary controlling factor of ET for both the summer maize and winter wheat growing seasons. Also, Gs was found to be another controlling factor that has more controlling power in the summer maize growing season than in the winter wheat season. VPD had a significant positive and direct effect on ET for both of the crop seasons, while it had a significant negative and indirect effect on ET through Gs in the summer maize season.

The revealed seasonal patterns and controlling factors of evapotranspiration in this agroecosystem provide a theoretical basis for optimizing water resources management of the Yellow River.

However, the effects of the type of vegetation restoration on soil C and N sequestration varies owing to different environmental conditions. Therefore, additional studies should explore the effects of vegetation restoration type on soil C and N sequestration, especially between natural restoration and artificial afforestation. This study explored the differences in improving soil C and N sequestration between artificial forests (AF) and natural grasslands (NG) that had been converted from sloping cropland over 20 years since the implementation of GGP (Grain for Green Program) on the Central Loess Plateau, China. The results showed that NG and AF significantly increased the 0-20 cm soil organic carbon (SOC) content but had a minimal impact on the 20-100 cm SOC content after 20 years of vegetation restoration. In addition, the two vegetation restoration types significantly increased the 0-60 cm soil total nitrogen (STN) content, but they both had no significant effects on the 60-100 cm soil layer. Moreover, the C and N sequestration capacities of AF were higher than those of NG due to the AF had higher plant biomass and lower plant biomass C:N ratios compared to NG. The AF and NG both significantly increased the soil aggregate structure and stability following cropland conversions. Apart from soil aggregates playing a crucial role in affecting soil C and N sequestration, plant biomass and its C:N ratios also had the most substantial effects. The results suggested that soil aggregate stability and the quantity and quality of input organic matter have strongly influenced soil C and N sequestration post-restoration; moreover, N fixing species is more conducive to soil C and N sequestration and the artificial forests had higher C and N sequestration capacities than natural grasslands in the Loess Plateau, with a mean annual precipitation of 505 mm.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	Li, Jiwei/0000-0003-3912-4564; Wu, Jianzhao/0000-0003-3124-1109													0341-8162	1872-6887				JAN	2022	208								105734	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105734	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105734		SEP 2021											WOS:000700576300024

In this study, we investigated the role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in response to N availability in three soybean cultivars, JINDOU 19 (JD19), LONGHUANG 3 (LH3), and LONGDOU 2 (LD2), that have different tolerances to low-N stress. The results showed that the leaf area and primary root length of JD19 and LH3 were greater than that of LD2 under low-N stress, suggesting that the growth of JD19 and LH3 were impaired less than LD2, and thus are more tolerant to low-N stress than LD2 is. Interestingly, the G6PDH expression showed different degrees of change in these soybean cultivars under low-N conditions, and the G6PDH activity in JD19 and LH3 was higher than that in LD2. When G6PDH was inhibited by glucosamine (GlcN), the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 were dramatically increased under low-N stress. Meanwhile, the activities of N metabolism-related enzymes were inhibited. These results indicate that G6PDH is involved in the tolerance of soybean cultivars to low-N stress through affecting the N metabolism. Furthermore, under low-N conditions, the contents of NADP(+) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in JD19 and LH3 were increased more than that in LD2. In contrast, the activity of the plasma membrane (PM), NADPH oxidase, and the NADPH content in JD19 and LH3 were lower than that in LD2. In conclusion, G6PDH reduces the accumulation of ROS in plant cells by modulating NADPH/NADP(+) and GSH levels to maintain the growth of soybeans under low-N conditions.					bi, yu/JOK-3859-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023	Bi, Yurong/0000-0003-2412-3673														2073-4395				APR	2021	11	4							637	10.3390/agronomy11040637	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11040637													WOS:000642650000001

Clarifying the complex relationships between plant traits would enable us to better understand how plants employ different strategies to adapt to the environment. Although increasing attention is being paid to plant traits, few studies focused on the adaptation to aridity through the relationship among multiple traits. We established plant trait networks (PTNs) to explore the interdependence of sixteen plant traits across drylands.ResultsOur results revealed significant differences in PTNs among different plant life-forms and different levels of aridity. Trait relationships for woody plants were weaker, but were more modularized than for herbs. Woody plants were more connected in economic traits, whereas herbs were more connected in structural traits to reduce damage caused by drought. Furthermore, the correlations between traits were tighter with higher edge density in semi-arid than in arid regions, suggesting that resource sharing and trait coordination are more advantageous under low drought conditions. Importantly, our results demonstrated that stem phosphorus concentration (SPC) was a hub trait correlated with other traits across drylands.ConclusionsThe results demonstrate that plants exhibited adaptations to the arid environment by adjusting trait modules through alternative strategies. PTNs provide a new insight into understanding the adaptation strategies of plants to drought stress based on the interdependence among plant functional traits.

However, studies on gully development at the regional scale is relatively lack. The purpose of this study is to analyze the regional gully dynamics and explore how land use and topographic factors affect gully development. Input data consists of land use maps derived from high-resolution images from 2004 to 2014, and topography maps from a digital elevation model with a pixel size of 8 m x 8 m in two 25-km(2) study sites of Anxi (AX) and Xingning county (XN). The following results were obtained: (1) AX gullies decreased from 2006 to 2014 while XN first increased from 2004 to 2009, and then decreased from 2009 to 2014. Both AX and XN gully area in percentage of the total area ranged from 1% to 3%, which was higher than the average 0.25% of the whole southern China by the artificial survey in 2005. (2) Most of AX and XN gullies occurred along the ridgeline and had the close relationships with the upstream contributing area and slope gradient. (3) New gullies developed on the exposed land and forestland. The lost gullies were converted into forestland and grassland. In fact, most of these gullies were only covered by vegetation, not real disappearance. These results proved that gully decreased, but construction of roads and buildings intensified gully development. Consequently, these findings reveal that vegetation protection and ecological restoration should be adopted in southern China.

Viswanatha			Energy and carbon budgeting in a soybean-wheat system in different tillage, irrigation and fertilizer management practices in South-Asian semi-arid agroecology	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												The sustainability of agricultural production systems is significantly threatened due to climate change and land degradation. Agricultural practices like conventional tillage with imbalanced fertilizers, and indiscriminate irrigation have serious environmental implications like higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, we assessed the three-year productivity, effectiveness of energy, and carbon (C) footprint of soybean-wheat system under different tillage techniques [zero-till fiat beds (ZTFB), conventional till-raised beds (CTRB), and conven-tional till-fiat beds (CTFB)], irrigation regimes [irrigation at 25%, 50%, and 75% depletion of available soil moisture (DASM)] and fertilizer rates [50% and 100% recommended rates of fertilizers (RRF). The study was conducted for three years in a fixed-field plots using split-split plot design with three replications. The results show that conventional till-raised bed (CTRB) recorded higher system crop productivity (9.5-15.2%), energy-efficiency (17.3), C-output (6424), C-efficiency (11.7), C-sustainability index (9.73), net-returns (1035 US$ ha-1) and the least C-footprints (0.19) over conventional till-fiat beds (CTFB) and zero till-fiat beds (ZTFB). Whereas, residue mulched ZTFB plots exhibited-24.2% higher system water productivity and consumed less energy (-77.0%) over others. Irrigation applied at 25% depletion of available soil moisture (DASM25%) led to higher system productivity (5.96 Mg ha-1), energy output (232.6 GJ ha-1), energy-efficiency (13.4) and C-output (6657.4 kg CE ha-1) compared to DASM75% and DASM50%. Interestingly, C-footprints increased with ZTFB while least C-footprints were found under CTRB and CTFB. Consequently, the adaptation of CTRB with optimal irrigation and fertilizers will be a viable alternative for achieving improved system production, energy efficiency with a lower C-footprint under semi-arid regions.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of crop straw incorporation on the seasonal variation in Dc, the knowledge regarding which is limited currently, and identified the key influencing factors. Three typical crop straw types (wheat, soybean, and maize) were selected for this study. Soil samples incorporated with crop straw and without crop straw were collected over 375 days (from October 1, 2020 to October 10, 2021) and were subjected to a hydraulic flume (length, 4.0 m; width, 0.2 m) to determine Dc. The topsoil properties soil bulk density (BD), soil cohesion (Coh), soil penetration resistance (PR), soil organic matter content (SOM), mean weight diameter (MWD), and straw decomposition rate (SDR) were measured to explain the seasonal variation in Dc. The results showed that crop straw incorporation effectively reduced Dc, and the Dc for the soil incorporated with straw decreased by 25.92%-38.76% compared with that without straw incorporation. Dc exhibited a significant decreasing trend over time, and the Dc at the end stage decreased by 83.00%-88.31%, compared with the initial stage. Seasonal variation in Dc was significantly correlated with BD, Coh, PR, SOM, MWD, and SDR. The measured Dc decreased with BD and Coh as a power function and with SOM and MWD as an exponential function. The influence of straw incorporation on Dc is time-dependent and can be divided into short-term and long-term effects. Natural soil consolidation gradually masked the effect of straw residue with the decomposition of the incorporated straw. The comprehensive response of seasonal variation in Dc to straw incorporation was described by a power combination equation (Dc = 1.23 tau(1.65) BD-2.63 Coh(-1.33) SOM-0.70; R-2 = 0.96). Thus, the seasonal variations in Dc with straw incorporation were mainly controlled by the changes in soil properties triggered by the decomposition of incorporated straw and natural soil consolidation. The results of this study provided a scientific reference for soil erosion prediction and control in sloping farmlands.

Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) forests are frequently reported to have lower N availability and higher soil C storage than arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) forests. However, it is still unclear whether such characteristics stem from the low organic matter quality inherent in the ECM forest or other biotic and abiotic factors, such as competition for N between ECM fungi and free-living microbes. We conducted soil and litter reciprocal transplant experiments between AM-symbiotic black locust and ECM-symbiotic oak forests to separate the effects of organic matter quality and forest type (i.e., factors including ECM fungal presence and soil physicochemical properties) on decomposition rates and N availability. We hypothesized that the forest type, rather than organic matter quality, is a more determinant factor for available N content but not organic matter decomposition rate. Forest type had a more substantial effect not only on nitrate content but also on decomposition rate than organic matter quality. Since the litter decomposition rate was higher when placed in the oak forest, the higher soil C accumulation in the oak than in the black locust forests may be caused by greater C input rather than the slower decomposition in the oak than black locust forest. In addition, nitrate content was determined by forest type, suggesting the suppression of nitrate content by ECM fungal presence. This study suggests that the forest type with different mycorrhizal associations can affect biogeochemical cycling independent of organic matter quality.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				SEP	2023	165	3					327	340		10.1007/s10533-023-01087-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-023-01087-y		OCT 2023											WOS:001077759900001

Bayesian networks based laboratory retrofitting towards inherent safety: A risk-based implementation framework	JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES												Over the years, a number of high-profile laboratory accidents involving severe injuries, fatalities, and economic losses have been reported, prompting a significant increase in efforts towards laboratory safety. However, the dominant safety measures rely excessively on add-on safeguards such as sprinklers and respirators and pay little attention to reducing the hazardous factors at their sources. This study introduced the inherent safety concept to minimize laboratory hazards and developed a dedicated implementation tool called Generic Laboratory Safety Metric (GLSM). The Traditional Laboratory Safety Checklist (TLSC) was first used to represent the safety in-dicators, and then the Precedence Chart (PC) and Bayesian Networks (BN) methods were used to reconcile the safety indicators to develop the GLSM. The developed GLSM was subsequently demonstrated through a case study of a university laboratory. The results revealed that the safety level increased from 2.44 to 3.52 after the risk-based inherently safer retrofitting, thus creating laboratory conditions with a relatively satisfactory safety level. This work presented a set of generic solutions to laboratory retrofitting towards inherent safety with a novel GLSM as the implementation tool. The proposed GLSM would contribute to risk quantification and identification of key risk factors for assigning targeted and fundamental safety measures to achieve inherently safer laboratories.

Intense soil erosion has led to a sharp decline in both the mollic epipedon (ME) thickness and soil quality, and these processes have turn resulted in a serious threat to the national food security. Soil erosion-deposition processes influence the soil thickness. However, the quantitative relationship between the ME thickness and soil erosion-deposition rate along slopes remains unclear. In this study, the ME thickness and soil erosion-deposition rate along three typical long, gentle slopes in Heilongjiang Province were investigated by using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and 137Cs tracing technology. Variations in the spatial characteristics of the ME thickness and soil erosion-deposition rate on slopes were obtained. Wavelet analysis was employed to analyse the soil erosion-deposition rate on these slopes. The results indicated that the soil erosion rate along the three slopes was periodic and oscillated between high and low values. The range of primary cycle variation was 73-80 m, and the range of secondary cycle variation was 44-47 m. A negative correlation was found between the soil erosion-deposition rate and ME thickness within each cycle. The periodic variability in the soil erosion rate on these slopes also yielded a periodic variability in the ME thickness. Fitted equations were derived based on the ME thickness, slope length and soil erosion-deposition rate. The error range for soil thickness prediction was 0.30-9.40 %. This study could provide an efficient and accurate method to predict ME thickness change patterns along slopes and to help arrange soil erosion control measures at appropriate locations.

Earthworms are directly affected by the deterioration of soil properties during the degradation process. The feasibility of using earthworms to assess soil degradation, however, still needs to be verified. In our Loess Plateau study, earthworm biomass, density, and diversity (Shannon-Wiener, species richness, and Pielou's evenness) were investigated under nine different land use types (natural woodland, shrubland and grassland; planted woodland, shrubland and grassland; and cropland, orchard, abandoned land) and we analyzed their relationships with soil degradation. Our results showed earthworm biomass, density, and diversity associated with a low degree of degradation were significantly higher than those associated with a high degree of degradation. Earthworms can comprehensively characterize the physicochemical properties and biological characteristics of soils under different land use types. Linear correlations showed a significant relationship between the soil degradation index and the earthworm indices, indicating that the latter could be used to effectively evaluate and represent the degree of degradation of soils on the Loess Plateau over a certain degradation range. Nevertheless, this evaluation method requires further validation before wider use.					wu, yunhui/JGD-6838-2023; lin, qing/JED-5250-2023														1085-3278	1099-145X				MAY 15	2021	32	8					2606	2617		10.1002/ldr.3928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3928		MAR 2021											WOS:000630745700001

As was demonstrated by us in a previous study, a two-step process comprising solution processing of multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs) followed by vacuum deposition of fullerenes can be used for the preparation of non-covalent C-60-MWNTs hybrids. Transmission electron microscopy measurements and Raman characterization indicate that the hybrids comprise random 3D scaffolds of individual MWNTs and fullerite nanocrystals. While surface migration of the fullerenes on the MWNTs surface leads to coarsening of the nanocrystals, we find that controlled induction of SP3 point defects on the MWNTs surface (via UV/O-3 treatment) traps the initial nano-morphology and preserves the nano-dimensions and structure of the fullerene crystals. The nano-morphology of the treated nanotubes is preserved also when the hybrid is coated by a polymer layer (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl), P3HT, and the polymer-hybrid films show significant quenching of the photoluminescence, indicating that these hybrids could be useful in photovoltaic applications where the typical size of the nano-domains and the degree of crystallinity of the fullerenes play an important role in light-matter interactions.

This study examined the effects of exclosure on subsurface water levels, soil erosion, and the relationship between daily rainfall and subsurface water levels. Piezometers were used to measure subsurface water levels in the exclosure area during 2017-2020. We found that sediment yield, runoff, and the volume of subsurface water vary greatly depending on the exclosure and temporal practices used. Exclosure of grazing land was the most effective sustainable land management practice in reducing runoff and sediment yield. In 2019 and 2020, the subsurface water level continued to rise at piezometers with exclosure, which shows that exclosure contributed to the subsurface water level rising. In addition, piezometers in grazing land and the exclosure indicate that runoff trapped by acacia decurrens trees can contribute to significant differences in subsurface water levels. Higher runoff coefficients were observed in 2017 and 2018 than in 2019 and 2020, indicating that the exclosure greatly affects runoff; therefore, its implementation is vital to reduce runoff and enhance water conservation. Sediment yields measured for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 were 140.45, 133.15, 101.03, and 74.39 g L-1 da(y -1), respectively. In 2017 and 2018, sediment yield increased, while in 2019 and 2020 sediment yield decreased because of an exclosure around the gully's cross-section and communal grazing. This study shows that erosion is reduced by exclosure, possibly due to the restoration of protective vegetation cover. This study revealed that a minimum of human and livestock intervention during the study period considerably increased groundwater levels and decreased soil erosion. Generally, the results of this study indicated that exclosure has a considerable impact on runoff and sediment. Therefore, exclosure implementation is vital to reduce runoff and sediment and enhance water conservation, thus supporting the development of effective communal grazing land management measures on the study sites and other similar environmental settings.

The Tarim River, the largest inland river in China, faced a long-term exploitation of land and water over a rapid economic development. We analyzed land and water use from 1997 to 2019 in Tarim River Basin by Landsat images, and data on hydrology, climate, population, economy and PM2.5 (air particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m). Agricultural land expanded the fastest (4-11%), followed by natural vegetation (15-16%) and water area (4-5%) with population and economic increase. Air quality (PM2.5 mu g m(-3)) improved in upper (62-27) and middle (48-17) reaches. The water area in lower increase 5% because of ecological water delivery since 2000. Land use in the lower reach was dominated by agriculture, where the downstream runoff consumption increased by 6.8 times. The average annual air temperature and precipitation gradually increased by 0.5 degrees C and 51 mm in source and 0.9 degrees C and 30 mm in main reaches. The average annual water consumption in upper and middle reaches was 4 x 10(9) m(3), accounting for 87% of input runoff in the main reach. Water consumption in middle reach increased by 33 times in 2009-2017. The industry structure was changing from primary to secondary and tertiary industry. To sum up, implementation of water saving strategies and ecological water delivery restored local ecology. Sustainable strategies should be applied facing industrialization. Furthermore, changing the industry structure and restoring the degraded farmlands to grasslands or forests would keep sustainability of Tarim River Basin.

It severely infects eggplant cultivation in India and causes serious economic losses. Severe incidence (8 to 30%) of the disease was recorded in three districts of Uttar Pradesh (Varanasi, Mirzapur and Jaunpur) state of India during 2015 and 2016. A total of 58 symptomatic BLL leaf samples were collected from the surveyed fields and processed for nested PCR assays using phytoplasma-specific primer pairs (P1/P7, R16F2n/R16R2). Pair wise sequence identity and phylogeny analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences of BLL isolates in the study confirmed association of Ca. P. trifoli (16SrVI group) with the BLL symptomatic samples. Association of similar strain of phytoplasma was identified in Hishimonus phycitis collected in brinjal fields at all the locations, utilizing a similar set of primers pairs as described above. The population of H. phycitis was positively correlated with the incidence of BLL disease in the fields. The phytoplasma indexing of 55 eggplants varieties and 17 wild Solanum species through PCR assays revealed that one eggplant cultivated variety (Uttara) and 17 wild Solanum species were found immune, one resistant (Pusa Ankur) and 12 eggplant varieties/lines were found moderately resistant to BLL. However, all the 17 wild Solanum species were recorded free from phytoplasmas in PCR assays. Further, biochemical analysis of the resistant eggplant varieties showed higher peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase enzymatic activities along with the increased total phenols content. These resistant varieties identified in the present study can be utilized as pre-breeding materials to breed and develop eggplant resistance to BLL phytoplasma disease.

Grapeseeds are an abundant by-product of wine-making and contain bioactive substances that can improve the antioxidant capacity of meat. We examined the effect of sweet sorghum forage with supplementary grapeseeds on carcass and meat quality in lambs.Methods: Twenty-eight Small-tailed Han lambs (body weight = 19.1 +/- 1.20 kg), aged 3 to 4 months, were penned, and fed individually. The lambs were divided into four groups (n = 7 each) and were offered one of four diets: i) sweet sorghum silage; ii) sweet sorghum silage + grapeseeds; iii) sweet sorghum hay; and iv) sweet sorghum hay + grapeseeds. The grapeseeds were added to the concentrate at 6% DM and the diets were fed for 100 d.Results: Sweet sorghum silage tended (p = 0.068) to increase hot carcass weight, while grapeseeds tended (p = 0.081) to decrease dressing percentage without affecting other carcass parameters. Lambs consuming supplementary grapeseeds increased (p<0.05) meat redness and tended to decrease (p = 0.075) concentration of methionine in meat. Lambs consuming sweet sorghum silage increased (p<0.001) water content of the meat and had a lower (p<0.05) concentration of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio than lambs consuming sweet sorghum hay. Saturated fatty acids content in meat was lowest (p<0.05) in lambs consuming sweet sorghum silage with grapeseeds. Lambs with supple-mentary grapeseeds tended (p<0.10) to increase eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and have a lower thrombogenic index than lambs not consuming grapeseeds. Conclusion: It was concluded that sweet sorghum with supplementary grapeseeds fed to lambs; i) improved the color of the meat to be more appetizing to the consumer; ii) tended to improve the fatty acids composition of the meat; and iii) lowered thrombogenic index of the meat.

A two-year field investigation showed that full and half plastic film mulching harvested greater inseason rainfall infiltration into soils, and significantly greater grain yield and water use efficiency under the no-tillage conditions than under the tillage conditions. Among the no-tillage treatments, half plastic film mulching resulted in significantly greater soil light fraction organic carbon by 42.7% and particulate organic carbon by 41.2% than full plastic film mulching respectively, due to its enhanced extramatrical hyphal length, glomalin production and root biomass input. Owing to higher water availability, soil nutrient uptake was accordingly enhanced under no-tillage. This phenomenon was tightly correlated with the improved abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Therefore, it might be feasible and efficient to massively reduce plastic mulching but improve water use efficiency and soil health in semiarid environment.					周, 睿/HOA-5317-2023; Ma, mingsheng/AAQ-3176-2021; Xiong, You-Cai/HDL-8596-2022	Ma, mingsheng/0000-0003-4485-2945; Xiong, You-Cai/0000-0002-4394-8331; Zhou, Rui/0000-0001-6072-8464													0921-3449	1879-0658				MAR	2023	190								106851	10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.106851	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.106851		DEC 2022											WOS:000990561800001

The experiments were arranged in a split plot design with three replications consisting of tillage frequency (conventional, minimum, and zero tillage) as the main plot and the combination of seed rate (5, 15, and 25 kg ha(-1)) and glyphosate (with and without) as subplots. Results showed that zero tillage reduced teff biomass yield by 15% compared to minimum tillage and by 26% compared to conventional tillage. Zero tillage and minimum tillage also diminished grain yield by 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to conventional tillage. Lowering the seed rate to 5 kg ha(-1) reduced biomass yield by 22% and 26% compared to 15 and 25 kg ha(-1), respectively. It also reduced the grain yield by around 21% compared to 15 and 25 kg ha(-1) seed rates. Conventional tillage significantly diminished weed density, dry weight, and cover by 19%, 29%, and 33%, respectively, compared to zero tillage. The highest seed rate significantly reduced total weed density, dry weight, and cover by 18%, 19%, and 15%, respectively, compared to the lowest seed rate. Glyphosate did not affect weed density but reduced weed dry weight by 14% and cover by 15%. Generally, sowing teff using minimum tillage combined with glyphosate application and seed rate of 15 kg ha(-1) enhanced its productivity and minimized weed effects.																			0014-4797	1469-4441				SEP 5	2022	58								e34	10.1017/S001447972200028X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S001447972200028X													WOS:000849926700001

The effect of dietary lipids on CH4 emission in yaks has not been reported and is the subject of this study. Four Datong yaks were used in a 4 x 4 Latin-square design in which the four treatments included restricted intakes of double-low rapeseed differing in form and lipid (ether extract-EE) content: (a) rapeseed meal (EE 32.6 g/kg DM); (b) rapeseed meal and rapeseed cake (EE 45.8 g/kg DM); (c) rapeseed meal and whole cracked rapeseed (EE 54.5 g/kg DM) and (d) rapeseed meal and rapeseed oil (EE 62.7 g/kg DM). The digestibility of feed components did not differ among treatments. The ruminal total volatile fatty acids (p = .082) and acetic acid (p = .062) concentrations tended to be lowest in yaks consuming the diet with highest lipid content. In addition, CH4 production was lowest in this group (p = .004), and declined by 1.75 g/g DMI per 10 g/kg DM reduction in dietary lipid content, a rate substantially faster than in cattle.					li, Li/JPA-0218-2023														1344-3941	1740-0929				JAN-DEC	2020	91	1							e13489	10.1111/asj.13489	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/asj.13489								33314599					WOS:000603605600001

However, the investigation into changes in soil carbon stocks remains limited in these ditches. To address this, soil samples were collected from drainage ditches, which originated from the reclamation of saline-alkali farmland, at different reclamation years (the first, seventh, and fifteenth year). Moreover, fractions were separated from soil samples; a particle size separation method (particulate organic matter, POM; mineral-associated organic matter, MAOM) and a spatio-temporal substitution method were conducted to analyze the variations in soil carbon components and the underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that there were no significant variations in the contents and stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) following the increase in reclamation time. However, in the POM fraction, the SOC content (SOCPOM) and stock significantly decreased from 2.24 to 1.12 g kg-1 and from 19.02 to 12.71 Mg ha-1, respectively. Conversely, in the MAOM fraction, the SOC content (SOCMAOM) and stock significantly increased from 0.65 to 1.70 g kg-1 and from 5.30 to 12.27 Mg ha-1, respectively. The different changes in SOCPOM and SOCMAOM, as well as the result of the structural equation model, showed a possible transformation process from SOCPOM to SOCMAOM in the soil carbon pool under the driving force of reclamation time. The results in terms of the changes in soil carbon components demonstrate the stability rather than the stock of the soil carbon pool increase in coastal saline-alkali ditches following the excavation formation time. Although more long time series and direct evidence are needed, our findings further provide a case study for new knowledge about changes in the soil carbon pool within saline-alkali ditches and reveal the potential processes involved in the transformation of soil carbon components.																				2073-4395				NOV	2023	13	11							2843	10.3390/agronomy13112843	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13112843													WOS:001120266000001
J	Shan, Y; Huang, MB; Harris, P; Wu, LH				Shan, Yan; Huang, Mingbin; Harris, Paul; Wu, Lianhai			A Sensitivity Analysis of the SPACSYS Model	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												A sensitivity analysis is critical for determining the relative importance of model parameters to their influence on the simulated outputs from a process-based model. In this study, a sensitivity analysis for the SPACSYS model, first published in Ecological Modelling (Wu, et al., 2007), was conducted with respect to changes in 61 input parameters and their influence on 27 output variables. Parameter sensitivity was conducted in a 'one at a time' manner and objectively assessed through a single statistical diagnostic (normalized root mean square deviation) which ranked parameters according to their influence of each output variable in turn. A winter wheat field experiment provided the case study data. Two sets of weather elements to represent different climatic conditions and four different soil types were specified, where results indicated little influence on these specifications for the identification of the most sensitive parameters. Soil conditions and management were found to affect the ranking of parameter sensitivities more strongly than weather conditions for the selected outputs. Parameters related to drainage were strongly influential for simulations of soil water dynamics, yield and biomass of wheat, runoff, and leaching from soil during individual and consecutive growing years. Wheat yield and biomass simulations were sensitive to the 'ammonium immobilised fraction' parameter that related to soil mineralization and immobilisation. Simulations of CO2 release from the soil and soil nutrient pool changes were most sensitive to external nutrient inputs and the process of denitrification, mineralization, and decomposition. This study provides important evidence of which SPACSYS parameters require the most care in their specification. Moving forward, this evidence can help direct efficient sampling and lab analyses for increased accuracy of such parameters. Results provide a useful reference for model users on which parameters are most influential for different simulation goals, which in turn provides better informed decision making for farmers and government policy alike.

This study aimed to determine how changes in soil N influence soil microbial community diversity and potential functions. Methods We evaluated plant characteristics, soil chemical properties, microbial composition, and potential functions (N-fixation and functional fungal guild) after 3 years of urea fertilization at four different levels (0, 25, 50, and 100 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) in a semiarid grassland in China. Compositions of bacterial and fungal communities were determined by high-throughput sequencing, and their potential functions were predicted by comparing their data with those in the Tax4Fun and FUNGuild databases, respectively. Results Compared with the grassland without N input (N0), N fertilization significantly reduced soil bacterial diversity, possibly by reducing plant diversity. Fungal diversity increased with N fertilization and peaked in the N50 treatment, while the aboveground biomass showed a parallel increase and peak. A lower abundance of nif genes was found in the N100 than in the N0 treatment because the enhanced NO3- and NH4+ content alleviated the dependence of plants on biological N-fixation and reduced the N-fixation potential. N fertilization increased the relative abundance of saprotrophs (wood, plant, and dung saprotrophs) and pathogens (plant and animal pathogens). However, this promotion could be weakened when the excessive N fertilization was applied due to the lower abundance in the N100 than in the N50 treatment, and these changes could be attributed to the variation in aboveground biomass and soil organic C. Changes in the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were related to their host plants, exhibiting a transient increase in the N25 compared to the N0 treatment and then sharply decreasing. Conclusions Our results show that N-induced environmental changes have considerable influence on the composition and potential functions of soil bacterial and fungal communities, which are likely to be dependent on interactions between plants and soil.

Good quality groundwater is required for high crop yields in arid regions. A total of 45 samples were collected from wells and analyzed in the laboratory for this research work. Different water quality parameters were determined from these samples, namely electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), sodium percent (Na%), and permeability index (PI) during the pre- and post-monsoon season. The water types were identified through a Piper-trilinear diagram. Fifty per cent of the water samples of the total basin area fall under the saline category. The local farmers heavily rely on groundwater for the irrigation of crops. Excess use of groundwater for irrigation raises soil salinity. Some parts of the study area are facing serious problems such as loss of crop yields, and low availability of good quality groundwater even for drinking purposes. The results highlight that the study area has a high salinity content (C3) and low sodium (51). The maps for different water quality parameters were generated using inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method in ArcGIS 10.3 software.

Potential natural vegetation (PNV) and climate adaptation concepts should be integrated into revegetation programs to achieve sustainable ecosystems. The Yanhe Basin in the Loess Plateau of China (7687 km(2)) has been subjected to intense human activity for centuries. It was selected as the study area because vegetation degradation and restoration are occurring there. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate whether the current vegetation pattern is appropriate, and (2) provide a restoration plan for future revegetation programs based on PNV and habitat suitability patterns simulated by the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. Current work focused on the parameter calibration and high-resolution climate data of the model over the study area. The comparisons of model performances in the PNV pattern and productivity indicated that parameter calibration was necessary for the model application. PNV of the Yanhe Basin may shift by 21.37-29.67% from 1981-2010 to 2071-2100, mainly in the southern part. Forests may decrease and steppes may increase as the climate becomes drier in the future. Comparisons between an existing land use map and the current PNV pattern indicated that only 40.8% of the forestland was coincident with the current PNV pattern, whereas grassland was a more suitable vegetation type for the rest of the terrain. In contrast, 83.1% of the grassland aligned with the current PNV pattern. Therefore, 16.9% remains to be forested. Current forestland and grassland patterns should be adjusted to cope with future climate change. Broadleaf summer-green shrubs covered a larger area and had higher habitat suitability than forests; they might be the most suitable woody plants for revegetation of the Yanhe Basin. The applied research approach could be extended to other regions undergoing similar revegetation programs and help promote sustainable vegetation management.

However, the synergistic involvement of H2S and rhizobia in photosynthetic carbon (C) metabolism in soybean (Glycine max) under nitrogen (N) deficiency has been largely overlooked. Therefore, we scrutinised how H2S drives photosynthetic C fixation, utilisation, and accumulation in soybean-rhizobia symbiotic systems. When soybeans encountered N deficiency, organ growth, grain output, and nodule N-fixation performance were considerably improved owing to H2S and rhizobia. Furthermore, H2S collaborated with rhizobia to actively govern assimilation product generation and transport, modulating C allocation, utilisation, and accumulation. Additionally, H2S and rhizobia profoundly affected critical enzyme activities and coding gene expressions implicated in C fixation, transport, and metabolism. Furthermore, we observed substantial effects of H2S and rhizobia on primary metabolism and C-N coupled metabolic networks in essential organs via C metabolic regulation. Consequently, H2S synergy with rhizobia inspired complex primary metabolism and C-N coupled metabolic pathways by directing the expression of key enzymes and related coding genes involved in C metabolism, stimulating effective C fixation, transport, and distribution, and ultimately improving N fixation, growth, and grain yield in soybeans.																			0140-7791	1365-3040				AUG	2023	46	8					2523	2541		10.1111/pce.14643	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.14643		JUN 2023						37303272					WOS:001003322300001

Canopy dynamics of lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) genotypes of three fall dormancies grown under contrasting defoliation frequencies	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												This study evaluated the canopy dynamics of three lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) genotypes of different fall dormancy (FD) ratings when grown under three contrasting defoliation regimes over five regrowth seasons at Lincoln University, Canterbury, New Zealand. Crops were sown in October 2014 in a split-plot design with main plots as defoliation frequencies (28 days [DF 28], 42 days [DF 42] and 84 days [DF 84]) and genotypes as subplots. Genotypes varied in fall dormancy (FD) rating and were classified as dormant (cv. AgR Palatable, FD2), semi-dormant (cv. Grassland Kaituna, FD5), or non-dormant (cv. SARDI 10, FD10). All crops were grown through an establishment phase until January 2015, when defoliation treatments were imposed. The experiment terminated in May 2019. Defoliation treatments were imposed from early spring (August-September) to autumn (May) with a single clean-up graze in late June/July. Defoliation frequency x genotype interactions showed FD10 was the most productive in regrowth season 1 but least persistent and productive in regrowth season 5, particularly under the DF 28 and DF 42 treatments. Results suggest different partitioning responses amongst genotypes. In a decreasing photoperiod, the growth rate of FD2 decreased by 0.77 +/- 0.07 kg DM ha-1 degrees Cd- 1 compared with 0.67 +/- 0.09 kg DM ha-1 degrees Cd- 1 for FD5 and FD10. However, FD10 showed no response to an increasing photoperiod under the DF28 defoliation regime. The lower rate of partitioning to perennial biomass of FD10 was suggested by the rapid decline in shoot density (-0.000112 shoot m- 2 degrees Cd- 1) over time compared with - 0.000049 shoot m- 2 degrees Cd- 1 for FD2 and FD5. FD10 had heavier individual shoot mass over the last two years, but its canopy plasticity was insufficient to control the shoot size/density balance, so there was greater weed ingress. The DF 84 treatment enabled FD10 to produce > 15 t DM ha-1 year-1 over the five regrowth seasons, which was not different to FD2 and FD5. Under more frequent defoliations, FD2 and FD5 were more persistent and had higher yields than FD10.

This study applied a modified Hedley fractionation method to investigate soil P pools in 100-cm soil profile after conversion of wheat-maize (W-M) to greenhouse vegetable (GV) or kiwi orchard (kiwi). Land use changes from W-M to GV significantly increased total P stock by 82% at 0-100-cm soil profile. In particular, conversion from W-M to GV greatly increased easily available P at 0-80 cm by 11-291%, moderately available P at 0-60 cm by 83-253%, and non-available P at 0-40 cm depth by 42-214%, respectively. Conversion from W-M to kiwi also markedly raised total P stock by 15% at 0-100-cm soil profile, in which easily available P and moderately available P at 20 cm depth increased by 161% and 130%, and non-available P at 80-100-cm depth rose by 85.6%. Land use change also caused a shift in the distribution of P pools, i.e., percentages of easily available P rose by 10-13% at 0-80 cm under GV and by 10-15% under kiwi at 0-100 cm over the W-M. Correspondingly, ratios of moderately available P also increased by 7-8% at 20-60-cm depths and by 7-10% at 0-100-cm depths. By contrast, proportions of non-available P decreased. Our results indicate a huge amount of P accumulated into the soil profile, and its solubility also increased, especially under GV, which would have significant environmental consequences. Therefore, rational P management for cash crops should arouse the attentions in all sectors of the society.

To explore the effects of plant roots and soil moisture (SM) on infiltration process, an automatic measurement system based on a point source device was used to determine infiltration rates at different cultivated grasslands (leguminous, gramineous and mixed) in an arid region of China. The results showed that SM and plant roots significantly affected the infiltration process at different stages in the three grasslands. The soil infiltration rates were negatively correlated to SM, but a positive correlation was observed with the below-ground biomass (BGB). SM was the main factor influencing the infiltration rates in the initial stage of infiltration, whereas both SM and BGB determined the steady-state infiltration rates. The influence of the combined effects of SM and plant roots decreased over infiltration time. The decreased rate of determining coefficient showed that SM was more influent than plant roots. These results may contribute to interpret the observed higher soil infiltration capacity in the leguminous grasslands than in the gramineous and the mixed grasslands, and were conducive to better understand the effects of plant and soil properties on infiltration processes in arid areas.

Fertilizers alter soil C and N availability, which can affect C balance. However, the impact of fertilizers on C balance in grassland restoration has been equivocal and warrants more research. We determined the direct and indirect effects of the addition of three levels of C (sucrose) (0, 60, and 120 kg C ha-1 yr- 1), three levels of N (urea) (0, 50, and 100 kg N ha-1 yr- 1), and a combination of C plus N at each of the levels on soil respiration (Rs) dynamics and C balance in an alpine meadow in northern Tibet (4700 m above sea level). This study was undertaken during the middle of the growing season in 2011-2012. The addition of C and/or N stimulated CO2 emission, which was 2-fold greater in 2011 (102-144 g C m- 2) than in 2012 (43-54 g C m- 2). The rate of Rs increased with the addition of N, but was not affected with the addition of C plus N. Microbial biomass C, dissolved organic C and inorganic N were the main drivers of Rs. We concluded that N addition stimulated Rs to a greater extent than C addition in the short term. The application of fertilizer in the restoration of degraded grassland should be re-considered.

This study analysed the streamflow changes during 1958-2015 and related them to climate and land surface alterations in the Bahe River watershed of the Qinling Mountains by using the Budyko framework. The Pettit test method was used to investigate abrupt changes, and the Mann-Kendall test method was employed to assess monotonic trends. The results showed that annual runoff exhibited a significant declining trend, with a change point found in 1989. Annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration showed decreasing and increasing trends, respectively, but neither were significant. The hydrological responses were more sensitive to land surface alterations than climate variability. The contributions of climate change and land surface alterations to changes in runoff were 25.50 and 74.50%, respectively. The watershed characteristics parameter played a primary role, which indicates that runoff variability is most sensitive to land surface alterations due to vegetation change and land use and land cover change. This study could provide a scientific basis for how to effectively and efficiently mitigate changes in water resources and guide measures to be implemented in the region under future climate change.

As SIF is a continuous spectrum, deriving the full broadband SIF emission spectrum over 640-850 nm provides an opportunity to fully explore the potential of SIF in estimating GPP. Using high-frequency measurements of canopy carbon flux and SIF emissions at the atmospheric absorption bands, we reconstruct the full SIF spectrum from SIF signals at the absorption bands, and then analyze correlations between the GPP and the selected single SIF bands and their combinations using both linear regression (LR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR). Our results indicate that (1) the red SIF bands (640-700 nm) shows low correlation with GPP due to the strong (re)absorption of red SIF emissions by leaf chlorophyll; (2) the individual bands in near-infrared area (at 720 nm, 740 nm, and 761 nm) can determine about 60% and 62% of the variance in GPP with hourly scale by LR and GPR, respectively, and the combination of those SIF bands provide increased predictive power, explaining 66% and 76% variance in GPP with hourly scale by LR and GPR, respectively; (3) the solar radiation saturation, fraction of direct solar radiation, air temperature and leaf area index may have negative impacts on the SIF-GPP correlations when they are beyond optimal thresholds; and (4) the temporal aggregation of SIF-GPP (daily scale) enhances the correlations as compared with the hourly scale: the daily combination of SIF bands (at 687 nm, 720 nm, and 761 nm) can account for 80% and 93% of variance in daily daytime GPP by LR and GPR, respectively, suggesting that the combination of these three bands of SIF on the daily scale is the best proxy for GPP. Our results provide a new approach to analyze the SIF-GPP correlations using the ground-based full broadband SIF emission, suggesting that multi-bands SIF has a stronger capacity in predicting plant GPP than traditionally used signal band SIF data.

J	Wang, B; Feng, PY; Liu, DL; Waters, C				Wang, Bin; Feng, Puyu; Liu, De Li; Waters, Cathy			Modelling biophysical vulnerability of wheat to future climate change: A case study in the eastern Australian wheat belt	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Assessing the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change can identify knowledge gaps and direct where adaptation options are required. However, determining the vulnerability of agricultural production to climate change is a challenge due to the complex nature of the problem. We propose a climate-crop modelling approach illustrated by using the APSIM crop model forced with daily climate data as a case study in eastern Australia to assess the biophysical vulnerability of wheat to future climate change. This impact assessment is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's definition of vulnerability as a derivative of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. We selected one Global Climate Model (GCM) CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 representing dry conditions under high emission scenarios to explore the feasibility of proposed methodology. Our results show that, historically, the most vulnerable areas were the western parts of the wheat belt, accounting for 18% of the total wheat-growing area. However, areas of very high vulnerability would expand to central and eastern parts of the wheat belt into the future, accounting for 41% of the study area in the 2040s and 62% in the 2080s. With increased exposure to dry climate, adjusting sowing time and cultivar shift consistently improved wheat yield but were insufficient to decrease wheat vulnerability. We found the key driver for increased vulnerability was increased exposure to dry climate. We expect this study will help growers, farm advisors and state policymakers to adopt relevant adaptation strategies and promote efficient farming practices such as breeding drought-tolerant crop cultivars in highly vulnerable western areas.

Measurements and APSIM modelling of soil C and N dynamics	SOIL RESEARCH												Process-based models capture our understanding of key processes that interact to determine productivity and environmental outcomes. Combining measurements and modelling together help assess the consequences of these interactions, identify knowledge gaps and improve understanding of these processes. Here, we present a dataset (collected in a two-month fallow period) and list potential issues related to use of the APSIM model in predicting fluxes of soil water, heat, nitrogen (N) and carbon (C). Within the APSIM framework, two soil water modules (SoilWat and SWIM3) were used to predict soil evaporation and soil moisture content. SWIM3 tended to overestimate soil evaporation immediately after rainfall events, and SoilWat provided better predictions of evaporation. Our results highlight the need for testing the modules using data that includes wetting and drying cycles. Two soil temperature modules were also evaluated. Predictions of soil temperature were better for SoilTemp than the default module. APSIM configured with different combinations of soil water and temperature modules predicted nitrate dynamics well, but poorly predicted ammonium-N dynamics. The predicted ammonium-N pool empties several weeks after fertilisation, which was not observed, indicating that the processes of mineralisation and nitrification in APSIM require improvements. The fluxes of soil respiration and nitrous oxide, measured by chamber and micrometeorological methods, were roughly captured by APSIM. Discrepancies between the fluxes measured with chamber and micrometeorological techniques highlight difficulties in obtaining accurate measurements for evaluating performance of APSIM to predict gaseous fluxes. There was uncertainty associated with soil depth, which contributed to surface emissions. Our results showed that APSIM performance in simulating N2O fluxes should be considered in relation to data precision and uncertainty, especially the soil depths included in simulations. Finally, there was a major disconnection between the predicted N loss from denitrification (N-2 + N2O) and that measured using the N-15 balance technique.

A total of 25 foxtail millet varieties were evaluated in experiments from 2016 to 2020 under well-watered (WW) and water-stressed (WS) treatments. Future climate change might favor an increased temperature that impedes grain yield, so varieties with characters that are less sensitive to temperature change are preferred. Varieties with a high panicle dry-weight per plant, thousand grain weight, leaf area and water productivity in deep soil layer usually gave better grain production under both water treatments. Under the WW treatment, low grain abortion rate, optimal chlorophyll and canopy temperature and more roots in the upper soil layer could favor a high yield and drought resistance. Under the WS treatment, varieties with a high harvest index, low rate of water loss and more roots in the upper soil layer usually produced a high yield.					chen, zhaoyang/GRS-1470-2022															2073-4395				JUL	2022	12	7							1500	10.3390/agronomy12071500	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12071500													WOS:000833292900001

In this study, sheep manure was used as substrate, and sheep manure slurry, yak rumen fluid and slurry from a biogas reactor (SBR) were used as inocula in single-stage anaerobic digestion. The SBR and rumen fluid inocula increased biogas production by 23% and 43%, respectively, when compared to solely sheep manure in the single -stage anaerobic digestion. The two-stage anaerobic digestion, with yak rumen fluid as inoculum in the hydrolytic reactor, increased the biogas production by 59, 86, and 58% compared with the control. Microbial analysis of the effluent revealed that yak rumen fluid contained hydrolytic bacteria such as Proteiniphilum, Jeotgalibaca, Fer-mentimonas, and Atopostipes to enhance the degradation of sheep manure and increase biogas production. It was concluded that yak rumen fluid, rich in hydrolytic bacteria, increases the degradability of sheep manure and improves production of volatile fatt acids and biogas.

However, little information is available about the characteristics of DOM in response to water erosion and its role in soil organic carbon (SOC) stability. To contribute this area, a typical watershed in the Southern Red Soil Hilly Region was studied and soil samples were collected from two contrasting sites (eroding versus depositional sites). The DOM concentration and spectral characteristics, SOC stability and their relationships were determined. Results showed that DOM concentration in the deposited topsoil (0-5 cm, 0.69 g kg(-1)) was significantly higher than that in the eroded soil (0.27 g kg(-1)). Dissolved organic matter rich in aromatic, hydrophobic and high molecular weight moieties were concentrated in the eroded topsoil rather than in the deposited topsoil. Three fluorescent components in DOM were finally identified: tryptophan-like (C1), humic-like (C2) and protein-like (C3) components. The humic-like C2 in the eroded topsoil was significantly higher than that of the deposited topsoil (P < 0.05). The largest cumulative CO2-C (23.29 mg CO2-C kg(-1) soil d(-1)) was found in the deposited soil of 0-5 cm and it was approximately three times as high as that of the eroded soil. Regression analyses showed that the cumulative CO2 was significantly and positively related to the DOM concentration in two sites, and remarkably negatively correlated with the abundance of aromatic, hydrophobic, high molecular weight and humic-like substances in DOM. Our results indicated that the DOM was strongly affected by water erosion and can be an effective indicator for predicting the SOC stability feedback to erosion.					wang, dan/JEF-0836-2023; Liu, Jing/IQX-0664-2023; Nie, Xiaodong/HNP-3948-2023; luo, yuan/JLS-6416-2023; Li, Zhongwu/AAF-9530-2020; Chen, Xin/JDN-2017-2023	Huang, Mei/0000-0002-3533-0996													1470-160X	1872-7034				JUL	2019	102						724	733		10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.038													WOS:000470964500072

Optical features have become a powerful substitute for traditional fingerprints in recent years due to their fast measurement and low analysis costs. However, the accuracy of optical fingerprinting methods has received little attention. Here, artificial mixing and indoor scouring experiments were carried out to compare and assess the accuracy of optical fingerprinting results using three spectroscopic ranges [visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR), and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy] in multivariate models and using 19 colour parameters [such as red (R), green (G) and blue (B) in an RGB system; virtual component X (X), brightness (Y) and virtual component Z (Z) in a CIE XYZ system and so on] coupled with the conventional method. Furthermore, we examined how sediment sorting (particle sorting and organic matter enrichment) affects the accuracy of source apportionments. The results showed that VIS, NIR and MIR spectroscopic tracers presented high accuracy in scouring and artificial mixtures, with mean absolute error (MAE) values of 4.98% and 5.91%. In contrast, the colour parameters had weak performances in two experiments (MAE = 16.83% and 15.05%). Additionally, similar fingerprinting results of the scouring mixtures (MAE = 7.95%) and artificial mixtures (MAE = 8.20%) indicated that slight particle sorting and organic matter enrichment have little effect on the accuracy of optical fingerprinting results.

Trotter) yield. A field experiment was carried out for 2 years in three contrasting agroecological zones of the Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia, using a randomized complete block design with 3 replicates. The amendments applied were PAM (40 kg ha(-1)), biochar (B, 8 t ha(-1)), lime (L, 4 t ha(-1)), gypsum (G, 5 t ha(-1)), farmyard manure (FYM, 5 t ha(-1)), PAM + B, PAM + L, and PAM + G, and control. The results showed that PAM + L, PAM + B, and L treatments noticeably improved pH, available phosphorus (P-av), total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon, and water infiltration in the Aba Gerima and Guder soils, whereas the PAM + B, B, and FYM treatments expressively increased soil water content, P-av, and TN in the Dibatie soil. Likewise, compared with the control, teff yield significantly (p < 0.05) increased by about 25 to 37% at Guder, 25 to 32% at Aba Gerima, and 20 to 31% at Dibatie. The partial-budget analysis showed that PAM + L at both Guder and Aba Gerima, and PAM + B at Dibatie were more profitable, with net benefits of 1056, 1663, and 1975 USD ha(-1), respectively. Applying PAM in combination with lime on moderately to strongly acidic soils, and with biochar on slightly acidic soils could have a synergistic effect, leading to improved soil properties and crop yield.

Vertical distributions of six ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl- and SO42-) among five ice layers were compared after unidirectional freezing, and the temporal variations of ion concentrations at five melting stages were recorded during unidirectional thawing. Meanwhile, the evolvement of ice microstructure was also observed. Our results show that: (1) Driven by the rejection of ice crystals and gravity during unidirectional freezing, the total dis-solved salts (TDS) of the bottom ice layer were approximately three times that of the top layer. (2) Specifically, 45 % of the total amount of Na+ and Cl- was observed at the bottom layer after unidirectional freezing, and the 30 % of Ca2+ appeared to concentrate in the middle layer. (3) During unidirectional thawing, the desalination rates reached over 80 % after 14 h. With greater initial salinity, the brine channel connectivity was more distinguished. (4) The percent proportions of Na+, K+, Cl- and SO42-showed two peaks during unidirectional melting, where 30 % to 50 % of individual total amount was discharged. The percent proportion of Ca2+ merely peaked once, with 25 % being discharged.

This can then be used to correct the effects of canopy structure on canopy-leaving SIF. However, the feasibility of these estimation methods is untested in heterogeneous vegetation such as the discontinuous forest canopy layer under evaluation here. In this study, the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model is used to simulate canopy-leaving SIF, canopy total emitted SIF, canopy interceptance, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) in order to evaluate the estimation methods of SIF escape probability in discontinuous forest canopies. Our simulation results show that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be used to partly eliminate the effects of background reflectance on the estimation of SIF escape probability in most cases, but fails to produce accurate estimations if the background is partly or totally covered by vegetation. We also found that SIF escape probabilities estimated at a high solar zenith angle have better estimation accuracy than those estimated at a lower solar zenith angle. Our results show that additional errors will be introduced to the estimation of SIF escape probability with the use of satellite products, especially when the product of leaf area index (LAI) and clumping index (CI) was underestimated. In other results, fAPAR has comparable estimation accuracy of SIF escape probability when compared to canopy interceptance. Additionally, fAPAR for the entire canopy has better estimation accuracy of SIF escape probability than fPAR for leaf only in sparse forest canopies. These results help us to better understand the current estimation results of SIF escape probability based on spectral invariants theory, and to improve its estimation accuracy in discontinuous forest canopies.

Vara			Carbon Footprint Assessment and Energy Budgeting of Different Annual and Perennial Forage Cropping Systems: A Study from the Semi-Arid Region of Karnataka, India	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Efficient use of available resources in agricultural production is important to minimize carbon footprint considering the state of climate change. In this context, the current research was conducted to identify carbon and energy-efficient fodder cropping systems for sustainable livestock production. Annual monocropping, perennial monocropping, annual cereal + legume intercropping and perennial cereal + legume intercropping systems were evaluated by employing a randomized complete block design with three replications under field conditions. The lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) monocropping system recorded significantly lower carbon input (274 kg-CE ha(-1) year(-1)) and showed higher carbon indices viz., carbon sustainability index (165.8), the carbon efficiency ratio (166.8) and carbon efficiency (347.5 kg kg-CE-1) over other systems. However, higher green fodder biomass led to statistically higher carbon output (78,542 kg-CE ha(-1) year(-1)) in the Bajra-Napier hybrid (Pennisetum glaucum x Pennisetum purpureum) + lucerne perennial system. Similar to carbon input, lower input energy requirement (16,106 MJ ha(-1) year(-1)) and nutrient energy ratio (25.7) were estimated with the lucerne perennial system. However, significantly higher energy output (376,345 and 357,011 MJ ha(-1) year(-1)) and energy indices viz., energy use efficiency (13.3 and 12.2), energy productivity (5.8 and 5.3 kg MJ(-1)), net energy (327,811 and 347,961 MJ ha(-1) year(-1)) and energy use efficiency (12.3 and 11.2) were recorded with Bajra-Napier hybrid + legume [lucerne and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.)] cropping systems, respectively. However, these systems were on par with the lucerne monocropping system. Additionally, Bajra-Napier hybrid + legume [cowpea, sesbania (Sesbania grandiflora (L.) Pers.) and lucerne] cropping systems also showed higher human energy profitability. Concerning various inputs' contribution to total carbon and energy input, chemical fertilizers were identified as the major contributors (73 and 47%), followed by farmyard manure (20 and 22%) used to cultivate crops, respectively, across the cropping systems. Extensive use of indirect (82%) and non-renewable energy sources (69%) was noticed compared to direct (18%) and renewable energy sources (31%). Overall, perennial monocropping and cereal + legume cropping systems performed well in terms of carbon and energy efficiency. However, in green biomass production and carbon and energy efficiency, Bajra-Napier hybrid + legume (lucerne and cowpea) cropping systems were identified as the best systems for climate-smart livestock feed production.

J	Liu, G; Zheng, FL; Wilson, GV; Xu, XM; Liu, C				Liu, Gang; Zheng, Fenli; Wilson, Glenn, V; Xu, Ximeng; Liu, Chang			Three decades of ephemeral gully erosion studies	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Although concern for ephemeral gully (EG) erosion has been growing within the research community, knowledge gaps still need to be identified for a state-of-the-art review. This review is based on an extensive search of published literature in the Web of Science database that specifically addressed EG erosion. This review included 173 papers published in 56 scientific journals over the last 30 years. The results indicated that the main EG erosion topics were related to gully erosion processes, factors, methodology, models, and the detrimental effects of EGs. The definition of EG was identical worldwide. There is an urgency to define critical morphological values under different conditions for identifying EG channel locations in fields in order to map and model their development quickly and accurately. Topographic factors have been much more studied than other contributing factors, including climate, land management, soil, and hydraulics. Fifteen different methodological approaches or technologies, which were categorized into four kinds of methods, including field monitoring, modelling, simulation experiments, and review, have been employed to assess and quantify EG erosion. The average soil erosion rate of EGs in 36 publications increased and decreased with increase of slope and catchment areas, respectively, and the number of EGs linearly increased with catchment area. The complexity of the development of EG channels and the driving force mechanisms should also be studied intentionally, e.g., the quantification of soil detachment and sediment transport mechanisms for both surface and subsurface flow during different subprocesses, including gully head advance, sidewall collapse and bed incision. It was concluded that the interactive effects of different contributing factors on EG erosion across various spatio-temporal scales should be further researched. The comprehensive utilization or application of new methods and technologies, e.g., automatic monitoring technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, would be helpful to improve study efficiency and accuracy. The scientific basis of prediction models still needs further development and refinement. This review provides recommendations and suggestions to improve knowledge, prediction, and control of EG erosion.

However, they have been used less frequently to assess the ecological stability and soil C cycle in eroding landscapes due to a lack of knowledge of the responses of C-acquiring enzyme activities to soil erosion and deposition. In the present study, a 3-year field simulation experiment was conducted to examine the variations in the activities of C-acquiring enzymes (beta-1,4-xylosidase (beta X), beta-1,4-glucosidase (beta G) and beta-D-cellobiohydrolase (CBH)) from erosion-deposition plots with different slope gradients (5 degrees, 10 degrees and 20 degrees) on the Loess Plateau in China (2016-2018). The activities of beta X, beta G and CBH were higher in the depositional plots than in the erosional plots, and those differences were enlarged with increasing slope gradients. Compared to the 5 degrees-erosional plot, the activities of beta X, beta G and CBH respectively declined by 3.2-4.5%, 14.3-37.5% and 12.7-29.1% in the 10 degrees-and 20 degrees-erosional plots. The beta X, beta G and CBH activities were 2.2-18.1%, 17.3-32.1% and 14.8-86.2% higher in the 10 degrees-and 20 degrees-depositional plots than in the 5 degrees-depositional plot. Moreover, the total soil CO2 emissions from the whole erosion-deposition plots decreased as slopes steepened. The displaced runoff and sediment depleted soil moisture, SOC, clay and microbial biomass in the erosional plots but enhanced these resources in the depositional plots, which can account for the changes in C-acquiring enzyme activities. The spatial distribution of enzyme activities affected soil CO2 emissions in a positive linear function. The sensitive responses of the C-acquiring enzyme activities and the controlling effects of C-acquiring enzyme activities on soil CO2 emissions during erosion and deposition processes, should be properly considered in assessing the biological mechanism for nutrition cycling in regions predominated with fragmented eroding landscapes.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				MAR	2021	198								105047	10.1016/j.catena.2020.105047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.105047		JAN 2021											WOS:000605337000014
J	Zhou, HX; Han, SJ; Liu, WZ				Zhou, Haixiang; Han, Songjun; Liu, Wenzhao			Evaluation of two generalized complementary functions for annual evaporation estimation on the Loess Plateau, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Generalized complementary functions, which describe the relationship between the ratio of actual evaporation over the Penman potential evaporation (E/E-pen) and the proportion of the radiation term in E-pen (E-rad/E-pen) have not been widely used at annual time scales. In this study, the generalized nonlinear advection-aridity function (GNAA) and sigmoid generalized complementary function (SGCF) were evaluated for annual evaporation estimation with calibrated parameters in the Loess Plateau of China. For all 15 catchments, the lowest values of annual E-rad/E-pen were found to be much larger than zero, and the annual E/E-pen increased approximately linearly with annual E-rad/E-pen. This complementary evaporation relationship at an annual timescale differs from those at daily timescales, and requires different parameterizations of the GNAA and SGCF. For the GNAA, parameter c, which is often set to zero for daily time scales, need to be well calibrated with available data. For the SGCF, the upper and lower limits of E-rad/E-pen must be constrained. After calibration, both the SGCF and GNAA performed well at estimating annual evaporation. In addition, the calibrated Priestley-Taylor coefficient from the SGCF was found to be closer to the widely accepted value (1.26) than that determined from the GNAA.

A meta-analysis	BOTANICAL STUDIES												Background Halophytes are better than glycophytes at employing mechanisms to avoid salt injury, but both types of plants can undergo damage due to high soil salinity. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can mitigate the damage from salt stress in both halophytes and glycophytes by enhancing salt tolerance and improving energy efficiency. However, variations in mycorrhizal symbiotic efficiency between halophytes and glycophytes were still poorly understood. Therefore, we evaluated the magnitude of AMF effects on plant growth and determined the mechanisms that regulate the growth response of halophytes and glycophytes by performing a meta-analysis of 916 studies (from 182 publications). Results Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi significantly enhance biomass accumulation, osmolytes synthesis (soluble sugar and soluble protein), nutrients acquisition (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium ion), antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase and catalase), and photosynthetic capacity (chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate). AMF also substantially decreased sodium ion acquisition and malondialdehyde levels in both halophytes and glycophytes under salt stress conditions. Mycorrhizal halophytes deploy inorganic ions (potassium and calcium ions) and limited organic osmolytes (proline and soluble sugar) to achieve energy-efficient osmotic adjustment and further promote biomass accumulation. Mycorrhizal glycophytes depend on the combined actions of soluble sugar accumulation, nutrients acquisition, sodium ion exclusion, superoxide dismutase elevation, and chlorophyll synthesis to achieve biomass accumulation. Conclusions Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation is complementary to plant function under salt stress conditions, not only facilitating energy acquisition but also redistributing energy from stress defence to growth. Glycophytes are more dependent on AMF symbiosis than halophytes under salt stress conditions.					xue, xue/JTV-1627-2023; zhang, wenjuan/A-9413-2011; Peng, Fei/AAO-8461-2020; Tedeschi, Anna/B-5129-2015; Wang, Tao/AGJ-1581-2022	zhang, wenjuan/0000-0002-9704-766X; Peng, Fei/0000-0002-5816-4898; Tedeschi, Anna/0000-0002-3442-5117; Wang, Tao/0000-0002-2892-1050														1999-3110				APR 19	2020	61	1							13	10.1186/s40529-020-00290-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40529-020-00290-6								32307601					WOS:000526831500001

It is grown in marginal arid and semiarid agro-ecosystems with wide yield fluctuations due to spatial variability of rainfall and soil. Climate change, which is predicted to increase the intra-and inter-annual rainfall variability will further constrain the groundnut economy in India besides the global and domestic economic, social and policy changes. Through this study we aim to examine the biophysical and social economic impacts of climate change on groundnut production and prices to provide a comprehensive analysis of how agriculture and the food system will be affected. Using projected climate data for India, we estimated the biophysical impacts of climate change on groundnut during mid-century using representative concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) scenario. We examined the impacts of changes in population and income besides environmental factors on groundnut productivity. This is to highlight the importance of holistic assessment of biophysical and socioeconomic factors to better understand climate change impacts. Modelled projections show that by 2050, climate change under an optimistic scenario will result in & minus;2.3 to 43.2% change in groundnut yields across various regions in India when climate alone was factored in. But the change in groundnut yields ranged from & minus;0.9% to 16.2% when economic (population and income) and market variables (elasticities, trade, etc.) were also considered. Similarly, under pessimistic climate change scenario, the percent change in groundnut yields would be & minus;33.7 to 3.4 with only the climate factored in and & minus;11.2 to 4.3 with the additional economic and market variables included. This indicates the sensitivity of climate change impacts to differences in socioeconomic factors. This study highlights the need to take into account market effects to gain a holistic understanding of how economic and environmental factors impact agricultural food systems and economies.

M.			Influence of Zeolite and Phosphorus Applications on Water Use, P Uptake and Yield in Rice under Different Irrigation Managements	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Phosphorus (P) deficiency often occurs in paddy fields due to its high fixation, and low solubility and mobility in soils, especially under water stress. Available soil P and plant P uptake could be improved through the application of zeolite. However, little is known about the impact of zeolite on P uptake in rice under water stress. A two-year lysimetric experiment using a split-split plot design investigated the effects of zeolite (0 or 15 t ha(-1)) and P (0 or 60 kg ha(-1)) applications on water use, P uptake, and grain yield in rice under two irrigation management systems (continuous flooding irrigation (CF) and improved alternate wetting and drying irrigation (IAWD)). Both irrigation systems produced equivalent effective panicles and grain yield. Compared with CF, IAWD reduced water use and aboveground P uptake and improved water-use efficiency (WUE) in rice. The applications of zeolite or P alone increased grain yield, WUE, soil available P, and stem, leaf, and panicle P concentration, and aboveground P uptake, but had no significant effect on water use. The enhanced grain yield induced by zeolite was related to the increase in aboveground P uptake. The zeolite application enhanced NH4+-N retention in the topsoil and prevented NO3--N from leaching into deeper soil layers. Moreover, Zeolite made lower rates of P fertilizer possible in paddy fields, with benefits for remaining P supplies and mitigating pollution due to excessive P. These results suggest that the combined application of zeolite and P under improved AWD regime reduced water use, improved P uptake and grain yield in rice, and alleviated environment risk.

This study aimed to fill this important gap, as this information could be beneficial in designing a system to wean yak calves earlier than in natural time. We determined the average daily gain and energy and nitrogen balances and requirements of 4-month-old female yak calves (48.8 +/- 2.45 kg, n = 8). The calves were allowed to suck once a day and were fed an ad libitum concentrate: hay diet at a ratio of 60:40. Milk intake averaged 540 +/- 26 g/d, yielding 2.28 +/- 0.112 MJ/d, which was 13% of the gross energy intake (GEI). The digestible energy intake (DEI):GEI ratio was 0.681, metabolizable energy intake (MEI):DEI was 0.913, and MEI:GEI was 0.621. The average daily gain of the calves was 433 +/- 153.1 g/d, which consisted of 78.0 +/- 8.99 g protein, 52.7 +/- 23.74 g fat, and 302.3 +/- 95.1 g water, that is, 18.0% protein, 13.0% fat and 69.8% water. There were 130.7 g of body solids and 9.06 MJ of energy in every kg of body mass gain. Of the MEI, 25.17 kJ were required for 1 g of body mass, 83.40 kJ for 1 g of body solids, and 2.62 kJ for 1 kJ of retained energy (RE), and RE was 36.6% of MEI. The maintenance energy requirement was 5.35 MJ/d, the efficiency of utilization of energy for growth (k(g)) was 0.72, and the heat increment of feeding for growth was 0.28 (1.55 MJ/d). Digestible nitrogen (N) was 0.685 while retained N (RN) was 0.489 of N intake. The N requirement for maintenance was 11.73 g/d or 0.61 g N/kg(0.75) per day, while the biological value (BV) of N was 91.1%. The energy and N requirements for yak calves were relatively low, which could be explained, at least in part, by the high efficiency of utilization of energy and high BV of N when compared to other livestock. These findings could be beneficial in designing early weaning systems for the many Himalayan households depending on yak production for their livelihoods.																				2297-1769				JUL 13	2022	9								906440	10.3389/fvets.2022.906440	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2022.906440								35903137					WOS:000885968400001

The Mann-Kendall trend test, Pettitt test and Budyko framework were used to evaluate the contribution of different weather conditions and underlying surface changes on runoff during the period 1958-2014 at two stations: the watershed outlet (Zhuangtou) and the upper reach (Wuqi) of the Beiluo River Watershed on the Loess Plateau. The results showed that the annual runoff at the Wuqi and Zhuangtou stations exhibited a significant declining trend, with changing points in 2002 and 1994. Annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration showed decreasing and increasing trends, respectively, but neither were significant. The landuse change caused by the Grain for Green Project were the main factor causing the decreased runoff in the control area of the Wuqi station, and the contribution of underlying surface changes to runoff reduction was 95.50%. Different weather conditions was the major contributor to the runoff reduction in the lower reaches of the Beiluo River, accounting for 82% of the reduction. This study can provide a scientific basis for the effective mitigation of water resource changes in this region.

In order to achieve sustainable high yields of winter wheat in this area, we set 6,000 kg hm(-2) as our yield goal and investigated the effects of four types of management systems, including a conventional farmers' management system and three integrated management systems, on winter wheat production over five consecutive years. The management practices varied in terms of seeding rates, nitrogen (N) application strategies, and application of manure or biochar. Our five-year study revealed that the average winter wheat yield under a manure integrated system (MIS) or a biochar integrated system (BIS) could achieve nearly 6,000 kg hm(-2) while also enhancing water use efficiency (WUE) to 1.63-1.69 kg m(-3). The high yields under MIS and BIS were mainly due to the large plant population that these systems permitted during the whole growing season, which was supported by favorable soil N levels (NO3--N content) and sufficient water supply. The high WUE under both systems was mainly due to decreased loss of precipitation (i.e., increased storage in the soil) during early growth stages (from sowing time to regreening stage) and increased use of subsoil water (100-300 cm) during late growth stages (from regreening to harvest time) by the large root system. In addition, the annual evapotranspiration under MIS and BIS was much lower than the annual precipitation in this area. Therefore, MIS and BIS are likely to be useful integrated management systems enabling sustainable high yields of winter wheat in the Loess Plateau through the regulation of water use patterns in both spatial and temporal terms.					liang, liang/IAO-8518-2023; Chen, Hao/JHT-2948-2023; Yin, Lina/AAA-9723-2019; li, Yu/HCI-9086-2022; Li, yu/HHZ-5236-2022	Chen, Hao/0009-0001-6480-7976; deng, xi ping/0000-0003-4577-9217													0168-1923	1873-2240				JAN 15	2021	296								108210	10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.108210													WOS:000595613000006

K.; Kironchi, Geoffrey			Formalization of communal land tenure and expectations for pastoralist livelihoods	LAND USE POLICY												Despite progress towards recognizing communal land rights, there may be unintended outcomes, and for pastoral areas there is a need to be aware of how this may affect evolving pastoralist livelihoods. This paper examines trends in pastoralist livelihoods, perceptions and aspirations of pastoralists in a setting where a new communal property rights framework is in the early stages of implementation. The study was carried out in Dirre, a grazing unit of the Borana Zone in Ethiopia. It employed a mixed methods approach that included key informant interviews, focus group discussions, a workshop, a household survey and feedback sessions. The findings show that current livestock herd sizes make it difficult for pastoralists to rely only on livestock keeping, and have necessitated diversification. Crop production is increasingly becoming an alternative livelihood source, and most respondents reported wanting to expand their farms. Pastoralists also expect land certification to help secure land rights and enable better management of rangelands. However, there is also a widely held view that by providing security, certification will also make it easier for them to continue diversifying their livelihoods. This suggests that communal land certification is not likely to end the push to individualization of land and the transition to agropastoralism; it may even accelerate it. The strengthening of communal land rights can thus be used to guide this transition so that it represents a reorganization rather than a collapse of pastoralism. The focus of formalizing land rights for pastoralists should not be saving pastoralism or reversing the agropastoralist trend, but rather securing land rights to enhance the pastoralists' capacity to make sound livelihood decisions.

With the improvement of coverage of vegetation in urban environments, more attention has been paid to the carbon sequestration potential of the urban forest. However, the high fragmentation of urban forests makes it difficult to evaluate their carbon budget on a regional scale. In this study, the GPP-NIRv relationship model was employed to estimate GPP in Suzhou by MODIS, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing data, and to further explore what kind of remote images can figure out the spatial-temporal pattern of GPP in urban forests. We found that the total GPP of the terrestrial ecosystem in Suzhou reached 8.43, 8.48, and 9.30 Tg C yr-1 for MODIS, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2, respectively. Monthly changes of GPP were able to be derived by MODIS and Sentinel-2, with two peaks in April and July. According to Sentinel-2, urban forests accounted for the majority of total GPP, with an average of about 44.63%, which was larger than the results from GPP products with coarser resolutions. Additionally, it is clear from the high-resolution images that the decline of GPP in May was due to human activities such as the rotation of wheat and rice crops and the pruning of urban forests. Our results improve the understanding of the contribution of the urban forest to the carbon budget and highlight the importance of high-resolution remote sensing images for estimating urban carbon assimilation.

With its diverse range of climate and forest ecosystems, China also has diverse forest fire regimes. However, the spatial and temporal patterns of fire-driven forest mortality on the national scale remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employed satellite observations and statistical models to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns and underlying drivers of fire-induced forest mortality across China. Our results demonstrate pronounced temporal patterns of forest burned area and fire-driven forest mortality. On the seasonal scale, forest fires mostly occurred in the winter and spring, whereas the forest mortality is highest from May to July. Both forest burned area and fire-driven mortality exhibited a significant decreasing trend during 2003-2016. Forest burned areas are mainly distributed in Northeast China, Southwest China and South China. There exists a tight spatial consistency between areas with high mortality and burned area with East China as an exception. Correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis show that fire size, fire spread rate, fire duration and drought intensity had significant impacts on postfire forest mortality, with fire size and fire spread rate accounting for 38.3% and 37.1%, respectively, of the model's explanatory power. Our results highlight the importance of fire regime impacts on postfire forest mortality. Future climate change that drives more intense fire regimes might thus lead to enhanced forest mortality and increase the loss of forest ecosystem services.

Soybean has been considered a possible substitution for high-water-demand crops with improved water productivity and nutrient quality. However, due to inefficient and injudicious water and fertilizer management, the overall productivity and profitability of soybean is quite low. Hence, a three-year field investigation was carried out using strip-strip plot design with three replications to study the individual and combined effects of tillage, irrigation, and fer-tilizer levels on crop yield and quality, soil moisture and soil microbial dynamics. Results revealed that zero tilled-flat beds (ZTFB) and conventional tilled-raised beds (CTRB) reduced the irrigation water requirement by 5.15-5.45 and 3.12-3.49 cm ha-1, respectively, compared to conventional tilled-flat beds (CTFB). Moreover, CTRB enhanced seed yield by 8.1-31.5 %, biomass yield by 6.5-34.1 %, crop water productivity (CWP) by 27.2-30.9 %, and irrigation water productivity (IWP) by 55.2-57.5 % over CTFB. Similarly, in 2016 and 2017, CTRB had higher SPAD-chlorophyll content (34.3 and 33.2 in the top leaves) and normalized difference vege-tation index (NDVI) (0.51 and 0.71) values than CTFB and ZTFB. At 0.0-0.30 m soil depth, ZTFB showed the highest soil moisture content of 11.2 % and 22.5 %, respectively, leading to the highest relative water content (RWC) of 76.7-78.7 % in soybean leaves. As a result, ZTFB took 4-8 days longer to mature than CTFB, delaying the sowing of the following wheat crop. During the 2016-2018 growing seasons, irrigation applied at the depletion of available soil moisture (DASM) by 25 % and 100 % rate of recommended fertilizer (RRF) achieved significantly higher crop, biomass yields, protein yield, SPAD, NDVI, and CWP than irrigation at lower levels. Interaction effects revealed that combinations of CTRB and ZTFB + 25 % DASM + 100 % RRF strategies generated significantly (P <= 0.05) higher seed yield, biomass yield, and CWP. At the same time, ZTFB had significantly higher alkaline and acid phosphatase activity than CTRB, whereas the latter had significantly higher soil microbial biomass carbon. In comparison to individual use of these crop management methods, the results of this study showed planning soybean either in CTRB or ZTFB, irrigating at 25 % DASM, and fertilizing crops with 100 % RRF could help achieve higher crop and water productivity, thus sustaining soybean production in India and adjoining regions with similar agro-ecology.

Five samples with different particle size were obtained by superfine grinding and shear pulverization methods. Superfine grinding could produce smaller MOL particles with wider particle size distribution and greater surface area. Insoluble dietary fiber and protein contents decreased after the superfine grinding processing. As the particle size decreased, bulk density, tap density, water and oil holding capacities decreased but angles of repose and slide exhibited the opposite tendency. Differential scanning calorimetry curves showed that peak temperature and enthalpy change decreased with the decrescent particle size. No new chemical functional groups were generated observed in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in all samples. All X-ray diffraction patterns revealed similar shapes and superfine grinding sample exhibited the highest crystallinity index value. Scanning electron microscopic images revealed that superfine grinding changed the particle shape and the surface roughness decreased with the decreasing particle size of Moringa Oleifera leaf powders.

The engineering geology of RS is widely recognized as being associated with the parent rock properties as well as the weathering conditions. In the case of granite residual soil, how climate changes affect its disintegration behavior is currently not well understood. This paper performed laboratory disintegration tests on natural and remolded GRS as well as the residual soil subjected to various wetting-drying (W-D) cycles. The soil microstructure alterations due to W-D cycles are also investigated through scanning electron microscope and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The W-D cycles transform the microstructure of natural GRS toward the pattern for remolded soil by damaging the cementation among soil particles, expanding the pore diameter, and forming macropores and fissures. The deterioration of cementation weakens the particle association; thus, the soil is more disintegrative, and the generation of fissures facilitates this water-soil interaction by allowing infiltrating water to pass through. Several parameters are proposed to quantify the microstructure alterations and are found to correlate well with the disintegration rates of soil subjected to W-D cycles. This paper quantifies the microstructure evolution as induced by W-D cycles and enhances the understanding of the mechanism for the disintegration of residual soil.

However, although the alpine steppe has been used to raise livestock for thousands of years, only little data are available on the impact of grazing intensity on the soil seed bank. The aim of this study was to examine whether grazing intensity on the alpine steppe of the Qinghai - Tibetan Plateau alters the size and species composition of the soil seed bank. An increase in grazing intensity decreased vegetation coverage, but did not affect species richness, the Shannon-Wiener Index and the Peilou evenness index. In addition, in general, an increase in grazing intensity increased the seed density in the persistent part of soil seed bank, but not in the transient part and, also, affected species richness. In the transient part of the soil seed bank, species richness was affected significantly by grazing intensity in May but not in November. With an increase in grazing intensity, the perennial herbaceous species increased, as did the similarity index (Cs) between the soil seed bank and above-ground vegetation. We concluded that: 1) grazing affected the seed bank and above-ground vegetation but that some responses were not in a consistent continuum with grazing intensity, that is, some increased, peaked and then decreased ("hump"-shaped) and some increased, decreased and then increased again ("N"-shaped); and 2) species with longer longevity tended to dominate under heavy grazing pressure in the alpine steppe. This study provides valuable information for the sustainable management of the alpine steppe in grazed rangelands.					yang, xiao/HJI-7815-2023														0167-8809	1873-2305				DEC 1	2019	285								106622	10.1016/j.agee.2019.106622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.106622													WOS:000500213400013

Effect of soil particle interaction forces in a clay-rich soil on aggregate breakdown and particle aggregation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Particle aggregation and aggregate breakdown are important processes that frequently occur in soil under natural conditions. However, how these two opposing processes are affected by the forces that govern soil particle interaction remains unclear. Thus, in this research, we aimed to: (i) investigate the relation between particle aggregation and aggregate breakdown and (ii) probe the mechanism underlying particle aggregation and aggregate breakdown under the influences of soil particle interaction forces. Specifically, we investigated particle aggregation and aggregate breakdown in a permanently charged clay-rich soil in solutions with different electrolyte (NaNO3 and Mg(NO3)(2)) concentrations. We used the fast wetting method in aggregate breakdown experiments and the dynamic light-scattering method in aggregation experiments. For soils in either NaNO3 or Mg(NO3)(2) solution, the critical coagulation concentration obtained through particle aggregation experiments was equal to the critical breakdown concentration from aggregate breakdown experiments. This result indicated that the net force, which is defined as the sum of the van der Waals, electrostatic and surface hydration forces, is attractive for aggregation but is repulsive for aggregate breakdown. Although several interaction forces were involved in soil particle interactions, we found that the repulsive electrostatic force solely determines whether the net force is attractive or repulsive and thus determines whether aggregation or breakdown would occur. For a given soil, non-classical cationic polarization in cation-surface interactions strongly influenced the repulsive electrostatic potential energy of soil particles, thus influencing the occurrence of aggregation or breakdown. Our results suggested that adjusting soil internal forces is a feasible approach to regulate particle aggregation and promote aggregate stability.

Epidemiologic and spatiotemporal study on access to snakebite care in Northern Nigeria	TOXIN REVIEWS												The role of epidemiologic and spatiotemporal factors affecting access to care among snakebite patients in Nigeria are determined. In 2021 a total of 2,942 snakebite patients were prospectively studied at four designated Health Facilities for Managing Snakebites (HFMS). The patients came from 94 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in 12 states in northern Nigeria. It was found that 435 (14.8%) patients actually accessed care within <= 2 hours of bite although 38.0% could have reached the HFMS within the time by car. In certain areas 92% of patients would have been able to reach a secondary or tertiary facility within <= 2 hours. Similarly, 437 (14.9%) patients traveled distances of <= 20 Km to reach a designated HFMS although 86% of patients resided within 5 Km of a road network. There was longer median delay to access care (15 hours), more patients (365) and higher proportion not treated with antivenom (22%) in August the wettest month of the year. Furthermore the patients who died (47) took a median time of 48 hours compared to 11 hours among known survivors (2,649) to access care. Expanding antivenom access to other secondary and tertiary HF in high burden areas especially during peak seasons will potentially improve the outcome among patients.

Orobanche aegyptiaca), achlorophyllous obligate root parasitic weed attacks economically important crops in several plants families including Solanaceae. Of the Solanaceous crops tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is the most susceptible. Available records showed that an array of microorganisms could give adequate control of the parasite and alleviate its damage in tomato. In the present study 88 actinobacterial strains, associated with antagonistic activity against plant pathogens, were assayed for their effects on germination of P. aegyptiaca seeds. Of the strains Streptomyces pactum Act12 was selected for detailed laboratory, greenhouse and field studies. The results showed that S. pactum Act12 cell-free culture filtrate inhibited seed germination and germ tube elongation of P. aegyptiaca by 93.9% and 97.4%, respectively. In potted plants S. pactum Act12 culture reduced P. aegyptiaca emergence and dry weight by 85.7% and 55.4%, respectively, increased tomato biomass, total number of bacteria and the ratio of bacteria to fungi in tomato rhizosphere by 25.8%, 84.9% and 123.6% over the control, respectively. In the field experiment S. pactum Act12 decreased P. aegyptiaca emergence by 32.3% and increased tomato fruit yield by 57.1%. The results indicate the potential of S. pactum Act12 as a bioagent for P. aegyptiaca control in tomato and suggest that the suppressive effects of S. pactum Act12 on P. aegyptiaca parasitism is an outcome of decreased germination, alteration of composition of rhizospheric microbiota and promotion of host defense mechanisms.																			0929-1393	1873-0272				FEB	2020	146								103369	10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.103369	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.103369													WOS:000495709900004
J	Guo, Q; Wang, ZL; Shen, N				Guo, Qi; Wang, Zhanli; Shen, Nan			Plot-based study to evaluate raindrop detachment capacity on moss-dominated biocrusted slope under simulated rainfall with different intensities	CATENA												Biocrusts play a critical role in prevention of erosion, but little is known on the relationship between biocrust cover and raindrop detachment capacity at the slope scale. Evaluating the raindrop detachment capacity on biocrusted slope is essential for better knowledge of the rainfall-induced erosion of biocrusted slope. Thus, laboratory simulated rainfall experiments were conducted on plots (140 x 120 cm) representing moss-dominated biocrusted slopes to measure the amounts of raindrop detachment under a complete combination of different biocrust cover (0%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 80%) and rainfall intensities (42, 60, 90, 120, and 150 mm h-1) at 26.79% slope gradient with two replications. The results showed that the biocrust cover, rainfall intensity, and their interaction all significantly affected the raindrop detachment modulus (RDm). The RDm in biocrust plot was significantly lower than in bare soil plot under rain events with the same rainfall intensities. The lower biocrust cover or the larger rainfall intensities led to higher RDm. Reduction benefit of raindrop detachment modulus (RB-RDm) were greater than its corresponding biocrust cover values. When the biocrust cover increased from 20% to 40%, the increase range and growth trend of RDm decreased with increasing rainfall intensity. Our results indicated that the development of biocrusts on slope is an effective way of reducing raindrop detachment by protecting soil in their covered area and increasing flow depth. When moss-dominated biocrust cover reached 40%, the raindrop detachment capacity effectively weakened even under rain events with large rainfall in-tensities. These findings may conducive to offer a scientific guidance for soil erosion control in the Loess Plateau and in other arid and semiarid regions.

Sustainable livelihood security of small farmers improved through a resilient farming system in the semiarid region of India	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Improving the farming system to attain the household level self-sufficiency, land utilization efficiency and sustainable livelihood security depends on better socio-economic and ecological aspects of the systems practiced by the small farmers in the semiarid regions of India. The higher sustainable livelihood security index (SLSI) in the integrated crops-livestock system helps to restore economic and ecological sustainability. The aim of this study was to analyze how various modules of farming in different combinations have interacted with the diversification of existing systems. We used the ecological security index (ESI), economic efficiency index (EEI), and social equity index (SEI) to produce a SLSI of improved integrated farming system (IFS) compared with benchmark farming in semiarid regions. In this study, different existing IFS comprising of seven modules (field crops, dairy, goats, poultry, horticulture, fishery, and apiary) in different combinations were examined. Results revealed that 72.5% farmers preferred to integrate two modules, where as 95% of farmers adopted field crops + dairy (FC + D) in preference to other modules. The sustainability indicators: ESI (+43.3%), EEI (+16.0%), SEI (+11.6%), and SLSI (+6.0%) were improved in the FC + D farming system to a greater degree than other IFS module combinations. Similarly, improved IFS interventions also increased sustainability indicators over benchmark farming. Based on large scale household studies over 5 years, our findings suggest that the improved IFS succeeded in providing a wider array of livelihood security than existing practices. Hence, the paradigm shift from component approach to an IFS-based resilient system, which is economically viable, environmentally sustainable, and socially acceptable, is needed for development of semiarid regions.

They can convert unavailable phosphorus in the soil into available phosphorus, which can be utilized by plants. The aims of this study were to investigate the chemotaxis of Bacillus cereus YL6 and its migration and colonization sites in Chinese cabbage and to provide some technical support for the subsequent investigation of the physiological regulation mechanism of phosphate-dissolving bacteria in plants. Methods This study demonstrated that the green fluorescent protein marker did not affect the physiological and biochemical properties of YL6. Through the chemotaxis test and pot experiment, the colonization and growth promoting mechanism of YL6 in Chinese cabbage was explored. Results YL6 showed a strong positive chemotactic response to cabbage roots. The addition of organic acids to the soil promotes the colonization of YL6 in Chinese cabbage roots. Colonization of YL6 in Chinese cabbage is a dynamic process that moves from the root surface to root tissues and then up to stems and leaves. Fluorescence microscopy showed that YL6 mainly colonized cortical cells and vascular bundles of various plant tissues and was also observed in mesophyll cells. The proliferative effect of YL6 resulted from the interaction of effective phosphorus, and exuded auxin and gibberellin in the rhizosheath. Conclusion This study enhanced our understanding of the interaction mechanisms between phosphate-dissolving bacteria YL6 and Chinese cabbage. YL6 has the potential for future development into bio-fertilizer for agricultural production.

J	Liu, ZJ; Hou, LY; Zhu, YJ; Xu, XP				Liu, Zhanjun; Hou, Liyao; Zhu, Yuanjun; Xu, Xinpeng			Vertical distribution and regulation of Olsen-phosphorus in 6-m soil profiles after farmland-to-apple orchard conversion on the Chinese Loess Plateau	CATENA												Data on the dynamics of Olsen-P in deep soil profiles are crucial for improving P use efficiency but remain scarce worldwide. Hence, we sampled sixty 6-m-deep soil profiles from farmland and in 8-yr, 17-yr, and 25-yr-old apple orchards on China's Loess Plateau, and aimed to investigate the vertical distribution of soil Olsen-P following the farmland-to apple orchard conversion. Land-use change from farmland to apple orchard significantly affected Olsen-P at 0-40 cm soil, with the concentration generally increasing with age of apple orchard. By contrast, Olsen-P at 40-600 cm was not significantly different among the cropping systems. In both farmland and apple orchards, the concentration of Olsen-P decreased at 40-100 cm, compared with that in the 0-40 cm layer, increased with depth from 100 to 400 cm and then stabilized from 400 to 600 cm. The highest accumulation of residual soil Olsen-P in the 6-m profile (RSP0-600) was in the 25-yr orchard, followed by the 17-yr and 8-yr orchards, with the lowest accumulation in farmland. The differences in RSP0-600 cm were primarily associated with RSP0-100 cm, which was significantly positively related to the accumulative application of P fertilizer. The change point in soil Olsen-P against P leaching was 71.2 mg kg(-1), but in farmland and 8-yr, 17-yr, and 25-yr apple orchards, the averaged-depth contents of Olsen-P were all below the critical value, indicating no P leaching risk. Regression analysis revealed that the vertical distribution of soil Olsen-P was regulated by P fertilization at 0-100 cm and by crop roots at 100-600 cm, irrespective of cropping system. The insights gained on Olsen-P accumulation and migration within deep soil profiles after the farmland-to-apple orchard conversion can help to optimize land use and P fertilization management in major apple-producing countries with burgeoning growth in apple production.					wang, zhe/JNE-3510-2023; Zhang, Liqun/JDN-3523-2023														0341-8162	1872-6887				JUL	2021	202								105254	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105254		MAR 2021											WOS:000643594100023

As a result, the sediment flux of the Yellow River, once the largest carrier of fluvial sediment worldwide, has been reduced by approximately 85 % in the past 60 years. However, the effects of SWC measures on erosion, transport, and deposition of sediment are still difficult to quantify, which greatly limits the further planning and adjustment of SWC measures. Here, we determined soil erosion, sediment deposition, and sediment yield at different historical stages in a 187 km2 hilly and gully watershed on the Chinese Loess Plateau using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry technology combined with check dam surveying and hydrologic monitoring. The results show that the construction of check dams and vegetation restoration significantly reduced the soil erosion rate, from 21,144 t km-2 yr- 1 at Stage-1 (1960-1969) to 13,819 +/- 3,622 t km-2 yr- 1 at Stage-2 (1970-1999) and further to 4,723 +/- 1,278 t km-2 yr- 1 at Stage-3 (2000-2018). The sediment deposition rate was estimated to be 5,989 and 2,582 +/- 351 t km-2 yr- 1 at Stage-2 and Stage-3, respectively. The variation in the erosion and deposition of sediment led to a significant change in the sediment delivery ratio, from 1 at Stage-1 to 0.57 at Stage-2 and 0.45 at Stage-3. Our research results provide an important reference for further SWC planning.

Future of Rice Yellow Stem Borer Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) Under Changing Climate	NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA												Status of rice yellow stem borer (YSB) during kharif was predicted for future periods (2030, 2050, 2080 and 2100) under A1B emission scenario of changing climate and compared with past (2011) and current (2016) periods for six rice-growing agro-climatic locations in India. Location-specific predictions for YSB severity (high, moderate and low) were developed combining criteria on weather variables and population levels of YSB adults in light trap based on rules of prediction. Validation of weather-based prediction rules on YSB for kharif (22-44 standard meteorological weeks) of 2011-2016 indicated varying degrees of accuracies for locations [> 80% for Ludhiana (Punjab); > 70% for Raipur (Chhattisgarh) and Karjat (Maharashtra)] and seasons [35-61% at Chinsurah (West Bengal); 17-87% at Mandya (Karnataka) and 35-100% at Aduthurai (Tamil Nadu)]. Prediction accuracies for 2016 were > 80% at all locations, but 48% at Chinsurah (West Bengal). Decline in 'high severity' during 2016 (the present period) over 2011(the past period) was noted at Raipur (CG) and Mandya (KA). 'Low severity' of YSB at present over past periods was documented at Chinsurah (WB) and Raipur (CG) with no changes at Karjat (MH) and Aduthurai (TN). Predicted YSB severity levels for future periods, viz. 2030, 2050, 2080 and 2100 using the temperature and rainfall projections of emission scenario of A1B indicated an increasing moderate severity of YSB at Ludhiana and Chinsurah in 2050 and the absence of high severity among five locations except Chinsurah in 2100. Increase in moderate and high severity levels between 2030 and 2050 followed by its decline in 2080-2100 at Mandya and the lowest severity almost throughout all periods at Aduthurai were the projected YSB status. While extreme weather events, especially high and unseasonal rains and associated fluctuating weather conditions can have negative impact on YSB severity, the future projected status of YSB implies its lesser significance over the present period of 2016 with rare outbreaks in the context of changing climate.

Earthworm casts, as a pollution-free improver, can effectively enhance the structure and properties of soil; however, their effects on water and salt movement in soil, under brackish water irrigation, remain unclear. In this study, we conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of earthworm cast treatments under four application rates (untreated, 1%, 3%, and 5% of soil weight) on water and salt movement in anthrosols (CS) and cambisols (AS) from the Loess Plateau. The application of earthworm casts was found to inhibit soil infiltration and evaporation, except for the 1% treatment in CS; inhibition also increased with more concentrated treatments. Compared to that in untreated soil, the infiltration rate and cumulative evaporation in cast-treated CS decreased by 23.9-32.2% and 5.1-9.8%, whereas in AS, they decreased by 17.6-28.5% and 8.6-20.7%. The application of earthworm casts significantly reduced the electrical conductivity of the upper 20 cm of soil, and the reduction increased with more concentrated treatments. Compared with untreated soil, the application of earthworm casts significantly reduced the sodium absorption ratio in the upper 0-20 cm by 15.6-31.1% in CS and 12.2-28.1% in AS. Applying earthworm casts significantly reduced the exchangeable sodium percentage of soil at 0-20 cm by 16.5-25.9% in CS and 13.5-22.5% in AS. Therefore, the application of earthworm casts effectively alleviated soil salinity and sodicity in both soil types by reducing the salt content in the upper 0-20 cm under brackish water irrigation.					wu, yunhui/JGD-6838-2023; lin, qing/JED-5250-2023														0378-3774	1873-2283				JUN 30	2021	252								106930	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.106930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.106930		APR 2021											WOS:000663329300005

Moreover, the accuracy of currently used instruments and techniques is undergoing constant improvement to yield better results. The effectiveness of the gun barrel for agro-forestry has been compromised by its low precision and high cost for many decades. This study aimed to develop a new method to increase the accuracy of the gun barrel by integrating the absolute fixed point orientation and adjustable gun barrel calibration profile using a total station for precise determination. For this purpose, the reunification of the measurement of an absolute coordinate system by total station resection with the aid of two or more known control points was carried out. Then, through barrel calibration, a fixed measurement target was set on the barrel and a fixed spatial position relationship between the measurement target and the axis of the barrel was established. After that, the orientation of the barrel was adjusted, and the three-dimensional coordinates of the fixed target were measured using a total station instrument. The barrel simulation test results showed that the total station has a good accuracy in the calculation of azimuth angle and elevation angle, while the measurement error could be guaranteed within 0.2 mil. Our newly proposed method has satisfied the accuracy test requirements and shown higher accuracy than other related conventional methods. It will make the gun barrel more useful and will enhance its applicability in the field of agro-forestry.

However, only few model frameworks exist that consider policy options as drivers of future LUCC and ES simultaneously. We present a modeling procedure that predicts policy-induced LUCC and ES through a combination of cellular automata (CA) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We employed this procedure to assess the efficiency of alternative policy instruments including direct payments and command-and-control regulations in mountain watersheds of South Korea. Our approach successfully captures spatial patterns of LUCC, hydrological processes, and the associated gains and losses in ES as well as potential negative externalities ("leakage" effects). Our modeling procedure provides an informative and robust basis for the development of decision support systems for mountain watersheds, where water provision and regulation are of particular concern.

These conditions engender relatively rapid speciation and diverse assemblages of highly specialised spider fauna. It is unclear, however, how zonation of these caves affects spider assemblage composition and structure. Surveys of 35 Levantine caves were conducted to compare the assemblages of spiders between their different ecological zones. The diverse spider assemblages of these caves differed between the entrance, twilight, and dark zones, with troglophiles and accidental species occupying the cave entrance, endemic troglobites occupying the dark zones, and hybrid assemblages existing in the twilight zones. The progression of assemblage composition and divergence throughout cave zones is suggestive of processes of ecological specialisation, speciation, and adaptation of cave-endemic troglobites in the deepest zones of caves, while cave entrance assemblages are composed of relatively common species that can also be found in epigean habitats. Moreover, the cave entrance zone assemblages in our study were similar in the different caves, while the cave dark zone assemblages were relatively distinct between caves. Cave entrance assemblages are a subset of the regional species pool filtered by the cave conditions, while dark zone assemblages are likely a result of adaptations leading to local speciation events.

However, owing to the lack of quantitative research on the effects of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of aquatic food webs, there is a lack of quantitative basis for river management. Nonpoint source pollution is not only difficult to control effectively, but also the success rate of water ecological restoration projects is low. With the increasing proportion of nonpoint source pollution in water environmental problems, it is urgent to quantitatively assess and predict the impact of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of food webs. Therefore, this thesis presents a method for quantitatively assessing and predicting the impact of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of food webs through using fuzzy clustering to screen the typical points of the impact of nonpoint source pollution, then using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and partial least squares regression analysis to comprehensively filtrate the driving factors affect food web that results in nonpoint source pollution, and then determining the impact of each driving factor on the structure of food webs. Finally, the change trend of food web structure is predicted. The results show that (1) the driving factors that the nonpoint source pollution that affects the food web structure is NH3-N and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The increase in NH3-N and COD promotes the growth of phytoplankton, causing the change of the primary productivity of the ecosystem, and ultimately changes the entire food web structure; (2) NH3-N and COD affect the stability, maturity, connectivity and complexity of the aquatic food web structure. The increase of NH3-N increases the connectivity and maturity of the food web structure but reduces complexity and stability; the increase of COD increases the connection of the food web structure, while reducing the other three indicators; (3) in some areas with good water quality, aquatic species diversity is high, the relationship of interspecies dietary is complex, food web structure level index is high and the structure of food web is stable. The food web structure in the rainy season will be better than that in the dry season. In some areas with severe water pollution and poor food web structure, the ability of the food web to resist external interference is weak.

However, questions remain about the roles of land use and erosion intensity on the composition, source, and fate of soil C eroded from terrestrial to fluvial systems. In this study, chemical characteristics of eroded water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) in soils and sediments, as well as subsequent source identification, were inferred from UV-Visible absorption and fluorescence excitation emission matrix (EEM)-parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) in study sites that include land uses and gully banks, experiencing three levels of erosion intensity in a semi-arid region of China. C-13 and N-15 isotopic signatures along with elemental ratios were also successfully employed to explore the source of bulk soil organic matter (SOM) in sediments. We found a much greater contribution of condensed aromatic structures and hydrophobic fraction of soluble organic compounds in forest soils compared to croplands at eroding sites, where these variables were greater than those of depositional sites. The results from fluorescence analysis in soil materials showed that erosion intensity has a negligible influence on WEOM quality. The EEM-PARAFAC with fluorescence indices indicated that biological production of soil substrates can also play a key role in the dynamics of WEOM induced by soil erosion. Our results from an isotopic mixing model analysis showed that gully bank soil was the primary sources of sedimentary SOM in all regions with different erosion intensities (mean probability estimate (MPE) 100% for the region with light erosion intensity, 36.18% for the region with high erosion intensity, and 99.25% for the region with extremely high erosion intensity). However, orchard and grassland were also the main contributors for the SOM in sediments in regions with high erosion intensity, accounting for MPE 29.93% and 33.89%, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that land use and erosion intensity have significant effect on nature of eroded OM.					wang, dan/JEF-0836-2023; Berhe, Asmeret Asefaw/D-4179-2011; Liu, Jing/IQX-0664-2023; Li, Zhongwu/AAF-9530-2020	Berhe, Asmeret Asefaw/0000-0002-6986-7943; 													0009-2541	1872-6836				FEB 20	2019	506						97	112		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.12.040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.12.040													WOS:000456708100009

A case study of Hubei Province, China	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals are proposed by the Chinese government, which aims to reach the highest level of CO2 emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. It is of great significance to accelerate green production and lead high-quality development. Energy carbon emissions account for 88% of total CO2 emissions, while forest carbon sequestration account for 80% of China's terrestrial ecosystems. In this paper, we analyzed the spatial and temporal evolutions of industrial energy consumption carbon emissions and forest carbon sequestration of Hubei Province, then demonstrated the offsetting effect of forest carbon seques-tration on the industrial CO2 emissions. Our results documented energy carbon emissions and forest carbon sequestration in Hubei Province both increased from 2000 to 2020, with the growth rates of 4.9423 Mt/yr and 0.28015 Mt/yr. Forest carbon sequestration could offset energy carbon emissions before 2005, while the off-setting effect was weak due to the continuous increase in industrial energy consumption after 2005. Significant spatial heterogeneity was observed in both energy carbon emissions and forest carbon sequestration. Wuhan had the biggest carbon emission with annual average carbon emission of about 20.046 Mt, while Enshi had the biggest carbon sequestration with annual average forest carbon sequestration of about 14.411 Mt. Spatial autocorrelation between energy carbon emissions and forest carbon sequestration was significant in Hubei Province in the past two decades. Our findings provided evidence that local-scale forest carbon sequestration could offset carbon emissions caused by industrial energy consumption at a certain extent, helping to draw up the scientific energy-saving and emissions-reducing measures.

J	Wei, YH; Jiao, JY; Li, YJ				Wei, Yanhong; Jiao, Juying; Li, Yujin			Evolution of historical sediment yield using check-dam systems as carriers: A case study in a restored agricultural catchment on the Loess Plateau, China	CATENA												It is critical to determine soil erosion rates and sediment yields under ecological restoration conditions on the Loess Plateau. Sediments retained in check-dams document the soil erosion history in a small watershed. We selected the check-dam systems to reconstruct the long-term sediment yield in a restored agricultural catchment on the Loess Plateau. The storage capacity curve method was applied to estimate the total sediment deposition of check-dam systems, and 725.82 thousand tons of sediment was trapped in the check-dams systems from 1975 to 2013. Two abrupt change points were detected in 1987 and 2003 using the double mass curve method; the average catchment sediment yields were 5,273.63 t/(km2.a) in Stage-1 (1975-1987), 1,734.09 t/(km(2).a) in Stage-2 (1988-2003), and 2,653.10 t/(km(2).a) in Stage-3 (2004-2013), represented intense erosion, mild erosion, and moderate erosion, respectively. In Stage-2, the sediment yield variation in the Fangta catchment was mainly affected by human activities, and its contribution reached 97%. According to the hierarchical cluster analysis, the soil erosion intensity changed gradually from mild to moderate and then to intense when the average annual erosive rainfall reached approximately 300, 350, and 400 mm in the Fangta catchment of the loess hilly-gully region. Approximately 6.1-42.6 % of the sediment was deposited along the way since 2003 when the sediments generated by erosion in small watersheds were gradually transported to the downstream river network. Therefore, check-dam systems are important carriers for reconstructing the historical sediment yield in small and ungauged watersheds. The results of this study not only serve as a basis for obtaining reliable information on erosion and sediment yield in small dam-controlled catchments, but also provide a useful reference for implementing sustainable ecological restoration in the future.

However, current national-scale TVCD assessments show strong disparities, despite the good estimation method of their underlying models. Here, we attribute this contradiction to a flaw in the methods of using multimodel simulation results, which ignore the connections between results, leading to an overoptimistic evaluation of the multimodel ensemble mean (MMEM) method. Thus, using the state-of-the-art multimodel random forest ensemble (MMRFE) method to integrate the results of 10 models, we reproduced Chinese TVCD data during 1982-2010. Compared with the nationally averaged TVCD field investigation data (27 +/- 26 Mg C/ha), we found that the results of five models were overestimated by 7.4%-85.2%, and the remaining models were underestimated by 3.7%-77.8%. The MMEM TVCD method produced an overestimation of 2%, but the MMRFE method produced an underestimation of only 0.2%. Additionally, the summary Taylor diagrams of the TVCD at the national and ecosystem (forest, shrub, grass and crop ecosystems) scales all showed that the MMRFE TVCD produced the smallest standard deviations and root mean square deviations and the highest correlation coefficients. Furthermore, the MMRFE TVCDs were all significantly positively correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and they had the same increasing trend, but an opposite variation trend from the MMEM TVCD and NDVI. This result implied that the spatiotemporal variation modes of the MMRFE TVCD were consistent with those of the NDVI. The results suggested that compared with the traditional MMEM method, the MMRFE TVCD and its spatiotemporal variation modes were more similar to the real TVCD. In conclusion, the MMRFE method can effectively improve the accuracy of national-scale TVCD estimation, and effectively reduce the uncertainty of large-scale terrestrial vegetation carbon estimation processes. Notably, we provide a new method that uses a machine learning approach to mine multimodel terrestrial carbon information to reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of terrestrial ecosystem carbon components.					wang, zhaosheng/AAX-1350-2021	wang, zhaosheng/0000-0001-7307-2249													2041-210X	2041-2096				JAN	2023	14	1					117	132		10.1111/2041-210X.13729	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13729		OCT 2021											WOS:000712880800001

The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of soil bunds on key soil properties and to develop regression models based on the Vis-NIR-SWIR spectral reflectance of soils in Aba Gerima, Ethiopia. Soil samples were collected from the 0-30 cm soil layer in 48 experimental teff (Eragrostis tef) plots and analysed for soil texture, pH, organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (av. P), and potassium (av. K). We measured reflectance from air-dried, ground, and sieved soils with a FieldSpec 4 Spectroradiometer. We used regression models to identify and predict soil properties, as assessed by the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). The results showed high variability (CV >= 35%) and substantial variation (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001) in soil texture, OC, and av. P in the catchment. Soil reflectance was lower from bunded plots. The pre-processing techniques, including multiplicative scatter correction, median filter, and Gaussian filter for OC, clay, and sand, respectively were used to transform the soil reflectance. Statistical results were: R-2 = 0.71, RPD = 8.13 and bias = 0.12 for OC; R-2 = 0.93, RPD = 2.21, bias = 0.94 for clay; and R-2 = 0.85 with RPD = 7.54 and bias = 0.0.31 for sand with validation dataset. However, care is essential before applying the models to other regions. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest spectroradiometry can supplement classical soil analysis. However, more research is needed to increase the prediction performance of Vis-NIRSWIR reflectance spectroscopy to advance soil management interventions.

J	Jia, XX; Zhao, CL; Wang, YQ; Zhu, YJ; Wei, XR; Shao, MA				Jia, Xiaoxu; Zhao, Chunlei; Wang, Yunqiang; Zhu, Yuanjun; Wei, Xiaorong; Shao, Ming'an			Traditional dry soil layer index method overestimates soil desiccation severity following conversion of cropland into forest and grassland on China's Loess Plateau	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Due to severe soil erosion and low crop yield, sloping croplands have been converted into forests and grasslands during the past decades on China's Loess Plateau (CLP). The introduced exotic high-water consumption plants cause soil water deficit that leads to the formation of dry soil layer (DSL). The traditional index method used to determine the existence of DSL considers only soil hydraulic property of "stable field capacity" and fails to fully reflect the interactions between soil water and vegetation. A new index method that considers physiological response of vegetation to drought is needed for DSL research. Here, we proposed a new method to identify and quantify the severity of DSL and compared the proposed method with the traditional method using field data for the 5 m soil depth in typical tree (R. pseudoacacia, n = 85) and grass (M. sativa, n = 20) plantations on CLP. The number of sites detected with DSL through the new method was less than the traditional method for both species. Based on the traditional method, the level of DSL was even more severe; with mean DSL thickness of 3.2 for R. pseudoacacia and 3.9 m for M. sativa. Then for the new index method, it was only 2.4 m for both plantations. DSL formation depth was much deeper under the new method than the traditional method. Also mean plant available soil water (PASW) stored in the identified DSL by the traditional method was similar to 44.1 and 37.8 mm; accounting for 37.2 and 88.9% of total PASW in the 1-5 m soil profile under R. pseudoacacia and M. sativa, respectively. Thus, the traditional DSL index method overestimated DSL severity as it fails to account for plant soil water availability, especially in areas with coarser soil texture. The proposed new index method that is based on soil water potential is more suitable for characterization of DSL conditions under different soil types. This is critical for application in reclamation of DSLs and optimization of vegetation cover in the study area and beyond.

The biocrusts affect the hydrological process of sandy land by means of inhibiting soil water initial infiltration and exchange in the topsoil, and thus hinder vegetation recovery of sandy land. This study was conducted to explore the response of the soil infiltration performance and soil water content underneath the biocrusts (dominated by lichen and moss) in litter cover. The differences in soil infiltration rate and soil water content among five treatments (bare sandy land, physical crusts, biocrusts, litter covered biocrusts, and litter crusts) in the Mu Us Desert were investigated by the single-rings infiltrometer and the oven-drying method. Results showed that the initial soil infiltration rate of litter covered biocrusts and litter crusts were 215% and 280% higher than that of biocrusts. The average soil water content in litter crusts (11.7%) and litter covered biocrusts (10.2%) were 3.3 and 2.9 times greater than that in biocrusts, respectively. Our results indicated that litter cover could break the water repellency of biocrusts, increase the initial soil infiltration rates, and increase the soil surface water content. This criterion will help promote ecological restoration in sandy ecosystems.

Measurement of rill and ephemeral gully flow velocities and their model expression affected by flow rate and slope gradient	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Water flow velocities in rill and ephemeral gully are useful for estimating hydrodynamics in the study on soil erosion. Laboratory experiments were conducted to measure erosive rill and ephemeral gully flow velocities, including nine unit width flow rates of 0.17, 0.33, 0.67, 1.33, 2.67, 5.33, 10.67, 21.33, and 42.67x10(-3) m(2) s(-1), and five slope gradients of 8.7%, 17.6%, 26.8%, 36.4%, and 46.6%, on sandpaper slope glued with silt loam soil materials to imitate fixed rill and ephemeral gully beds, using an electrolyte tracer method. The flow velocities measured in this research ranged from 0.31 to 3.34 m s(-1) for sediment-free water flow. The flow velocity fitted well with unit width flow rate and slope gradient by a power function, yielding an improved model with higher coefficient of determination than that related flow velocity to flow rate alone. The improved model is applicable for flow velocity and soil erosion predictions.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				OCT	2020	589								125172	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125172													WOS:000568830400039

Persistent free radicals in humin under redox conditions and their impact in transforming polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												The role of humic substance-associated persistent free radicals (PFRs) in the fate of organic contaminants under various redox conditions remains unknown. This study examined the characterization of original metal-free peat humin (HM), and HM treated with varying concentrations of H(2)O(2)and L-ascorbic acid (VC) (assigned as H2O2-HM and VC-HM). The concentration of PFRs in HM increased with the addition of VC/H(2)O(2)at concentrations less than 0.08 mol/L. The evolution of PFRs in HM under different environmental conditions (e.g., oxic/anoxic and humidity) was investigated. Two types of PFRs were detected in HM: a relatively stable radical existed in the original sample, and the other type, which was generated by redox treatments, was relatively unstable. The spin densities of VC/H2O2-HM readily returned to the original value under relatively high humidity and oxic conditions. During this process, the HM-associated "unstable" free radicals released an electron to O-2, inducing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS, i.e.,(OH)-O-& x2981; and(& x2981;)O(2)(-)). The generated ROS promoted the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons based on the radical quenching measurements. The transformation rates followed the order naphthalene>phenanthrene>anthracene>benzo[a]pyrene. Our results provide valuable insight into the HM-induced transformation of organic contaminants under natural conditions.

Moreover, the accuracy of currently used instruments and techniques is undergoing constant improvement to yield better results. The effectiveness of the gun barrel for agro-forestry has been compromised by its low precision and high cost for many decades. This study aimed to develop a new method to increase the accuracy of the gun barrel by integrating the absolute fixed-point orientation and adjustable gun barrel calibration profile using a total station for precise determination. For this purpose, the reunification of the measurement of an absolute coordinate system by total station resection with the aid of two or more known control points was carried out. Then, through barrel calibration, a fixed measurement target was set on the barrel and a fixed spatial position relationship between the measurement target and the axis of the barrel was established. After that, the orientation of the barrel was adjusted, and the three-dimensional coordinates of the fixed target were measured using a total station instrument. The barrel simulation test results showed that the total station has a good accuracy in the calculation of azimuth angle and elevation angle, while the measurement error could be guaranteed within 0.2 mil. Our newly proposed method has satisfied the accuracy test requirements and shown higher accuracy than other related conventional methods. It will make the gun barrel more useful and will enhance its applicability in the field of agro-forestry.																			0263-2241	1873-412X				MAR	2021	173																							WOS:000620271700022

To understand the contribution of individual parasite species and their assemblages to spatial variation in parasite communities, we examined species contributions to beta diversity (SCBD) and local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD) of parasitic gastrointestinal helminths (nematodes and cestodes) in two closely related rodents, Rhabdomys dilectus and Rhabdomys pumilio, from 20 localities across South Africa. Although the two Rhabdomys spp. are morphologically similar, they differ substantially in body size, habitat preference, and sociality. We asked whether the variation in life history traits and infection parameters are associated with SCBD of helminths and whether variation in environmental factors, host population density, and species richness of host communities are associated with LCBD of component assemblages of helminths. We also considered spatial factors to test whether LCBD of helminth assemblages demonstrate geographic structure. We found that the contribution of helminth species parasitic in both hosts to beta diversity significantly increased with characteristic prevalence of these species, whereas mean abundance, type of life cycle, and location in the host's gut had no effect on SCBD. The LCBD of helminth assemblages showed a significant positive correlation with environmental factors in both host species. Our results suggest that predictors of variation in SCBD and LCBD may substantially differ between parasites with different infection parameters and/or parasite communities at different hierarchical scales.					van der Mescht, Luther/J-8349-2019; Krasnov, Boris R./ABG-8403-2021	van der Mescht, Luther/0000-0001-8813-9549; Krasnov, Boris R./0000-0002-0382-3331; Haukisalmi, Voitto/0000-0001-7660-9670; Matthee, Sonja/0000-0001-7289-6262													0932-0113	1432-1955				OCT	2019	118	10					2863	2875		10.1007/s00436-019-06411-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-019-06411-w								31399870					WOS:000487313500013

Biochar and polyacrylamide (PAM) have been widely used to improve this soil structure, but their effects on soil hydraulic properties remain unclear. In this study, field and indoor culture experiments were established with three straw biochar rates (0, 2 and 5%, w/w) and three anionic PAM rates (0, 0.4 and 1 parts per thousand, w/w) to study their short-term amendment effects on soil structure and soil hydraulic properties. The results based on X-ray micro-CT showed that soil porosity with a 5% biochar amendment was greater than those with 0% and 2% biochar treatments. The saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) significantly increased with increasing PAM content, and the Ks was greater with 2% and 5% biochar contents than that with 0% biochar content. The saturated water content (theta(s)) increased with the increase in PAM content, whereas the change in theta(s )was insignificant with the increase in biochar content. With the increase in biochar and PAM contents, the macroaggregate ( > 0.25 mm) content significantly increased, but the synergistic effects of biochar and PAM on the macroaggregate content were not significant (P > 0.05). theta(s) significantly increased (P < 0.05) with the increasing CT-identified porosity. The reciprocal of air entry value (alpha) significantly decreased with increase in mean pore diameter and 3D fractal dimension. The 5% biochar + 1 parts per thousand PAM addition was the best amendment in our study.

However, the responses of microbial metabolism characteristic to heavy metal contamination and the mechanisms through which microbial metabolism mediate nutrient cycling and C dynamics in contaminated soil remain elusive. Here, we performed an incubation experiment over 80 days to investigate the variations in microbial metabolic limitation under various Pb levels (0, 100, 500, 800, 1500, 2000, and 3000 mg Pb kg(- 1) dry soil) in cropland soil using extra -cellular enzymatic stoichiometry, and to reveal the impact of Pb stress on soil C storage by associating with microbial metabolic quotients (qCO(2)) and C use efficiency (CUE). The results showed microbial relative C lim-itation and phosphorus (P) limitation were observed in Pb-contaminated soils. Pb addition enhanced the mi-crobial relative C limitation by approximately 7.3%, while decreasing the P limitation by approximately 12.3%. Furthermore, Pb addition led to higher qCO(2) (from 8.75 to 108 mu g C kg(-1) MBC-1 d-1) duo to the increase of microbial relative C limitation, suggesting that the more CO2 was released of per unit of microbial biomass C. The increase of microbial relative C limitation reduced CUE (from 0.35 to 0.10) because of the change in microbial metabolism from growth to respiration maintenance under Pb stress. Consequently, the CUE and qCO(2) together determined the loss of soil C. Our study reveals that microbial relative C limitation is the dominant driver of soil C loss and provides important knowledge of microbial metabolic limitation regulating soil C turnover in PTEs-contaminated agricultural soils.

Estimation of sediment trapping behind check dams using high-density electrical resistivity tomography	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Check dams are very important structures for torrent control areas throughout the world. Measuring the sediment deposition behind check dams is thought to be an effective method of estimating the sediment yield of small catchments. In this study, we employed a high-density electrical resistivity system to detect sediment at six check dams distributed in the hilly and gully area of the Loess Plateau. A total of 11 lines were arranged, with 60 electrodes along each line. The resultant resistivity data were inverted into subsurface structures using least-squares inversion techniques. The results indicate that the sediment bottom can been identified using an electrical resistivity contour method. Using trenches, boreholes and drillings to calibrate the calculated values, the accuracy of the high-density electrical resistivity tomography method was found to be quite high (95.7%). The bulk density increases with the sediment deposit depth and can reach a maximum of 1.6 g cm(-3). Geometric methods considering three shapes (V-shaped, U-shaped and trapezoidal) were used to estimate the profile area of the check dams; the V-shaped geometric method showed high accuracy. This study provides a four-step approach based on high-density electrical resistivity tomography and a geometric method to estimate sediment yield for check dam-controlled catchments. This methodology enables the measurement of the total sediment yield, including both the suspended and bedload sediment transport, from an ungauged catchment.

Commonly-used methods for seasonal yield forecasting are based on process-based crop models or statistical regression-based models. Both have limitations, particularly in regard to accounting for growth stage-specific climate extremes (such as drought, heat, and frost). In this study, we firstly developed a hybrid yield forecasting approach by blending of multiple growth stage-specific indicators, i.e. APSIM (a process-based crop model)-simulated biomass, and climate extremes, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index) before forecasting dates, using a regression model (random forest or multiple linear regression). Plot-scale wheat yield (2008-2017) in the southeastern Australian wheat belt was dynamically forecasted at the end of several targeted growth stages as the growing season progressed to harvest. Results showed that the forecasting accuracy increased significantly for both systems as forecast time approached harvest time. The forecasting system based on random forest outperformed the forecasting system based on multiple linear regression at each forecasting event. Satisfactory yield forecasts occurred at one month (similar to 35 days) prior to harvest (r = 0.85, LCCC = 0.81, MAPE = 17.6%, RMSE = 0.70 t ha(-1), and ROC score = 0.90), and at two months before harvest (r = 0.62, LCCC = 0.53, MAPE = 27.1%, RMSE = 1.01 t ha(-1), and ROC score = 0.88). In addition, drought events throughout the growing season were identified as the main factor causing yield losses in the wheat belt during the past decade. With the increasing availability of farming-related data, we expect that the yield forecasting system proposed in our study may be widely extended to other comparable cropping regions to produce sufficiently accurate wheat yield forecasts for stakeholders to develop strategic decisions in their respective roles.

However, the long-term effects of grazing exclusion on the microbial communities and nutrient dynamics within soil aggregates remain unclear. We conducted a 36-year exclusion experiment to investigate how grazing exclusion affects the soil microbial community and the associated soil functions within soil aggregates in a semiarid grassland. Long-term (36 years) grazing exclusion induced a shift in microbial communities, especially in the <2 mm aggregates, from high to low diversity compared to the grazing control. The reduced microbial diversity was accompanied by instability of fungal communities, extended distribution of fungal pathogens to >2 mm aggregates, and reduced carbon (C) sequestration potential thus revealing a negative impact of long-term GE. In contrast, 11-26 years of grazing exclusion greatly increased C sequestration and promoted nutrient cycling in soil aggregates and associated microbial functional genes. Moreover, the environmental characteristics of microhabitats (e.g., soil pH) altered the soil microbiome and strongly contributed to C sequestration. Our findings reveal new evidence from soil microbiology for optimizing grazing exclusion duration to maintain multiple belowground ecosystem functions, providing promising suggestions for climate-smart and resource-efficient grasslands.

The objective of the article is to study on how land use change impacts on soil erosion by using Intensity of Erosion and Outflow (IntErO) as a process-oriented soil erosion model. The study has been conducted under land use changes within the period of 1991-2014 in the Talar watershed located in northern Iran. The GIS environment was used to prepare the required maps including Digital Elevation Model (DEM), geology, land use, soil, and drainage network. The climatology data including average annual precipitation and air temperature as well as the volume of torrential rain were extracted from the data of meteorological stations located inside and around the study watershed. The results indicates that, within the period of 1991-2014, the forest area decreased by 12,478.04 ha (6%), while the other land uses including rainfed agriculture, rangeland, irrigated agriculture, and residential area increased by 7248.25, 4481.05, 476.00, and 273.95 ha, respectively. The estimated outflow with 100 year return interval was 432.14 m(3) s(-1) in 1991, which increased to 446.91 m(3) s(-1) in 2014. It can be concluded that the probability of larger and/or more frequent floods waves in the Talar River is expected to increase. In addition, the amount of production of erosion material (gross erosion) in the watershed increased from 1,918,186 to 2,183,558 m(3) yr(-1), and the real soil losses per year (sediment yield) of the watershed increased from 440,482.4 to 501,421.3 m(3) yr(-1). The results clearly emphasized how the lack of appropriate land management and planning leads to increase the maximum flow discharge and sediment yield of the watershed.

J	Li, YP; Wang, J; Shao, MA				Li, Yanpei; Wang, Jiao; Shao, Ming'an			Earthworm inoculation and straw return decrease the phosphorus adsorption capacity of soils in the Loess region, China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Loess Plateau is important for maize production in China. Therefore, a good understanding of soil phosphorus (P) behavior in the Loess region is crucial for optimizing fertilization in its agriculture systems. To date, research on factors influencing P adsorption/desorption has mainly focused on fertilization. Widespread application of straw return and increasing soil fauna in agricultural croplands inevitably affect soil P behavior either directly or indirectly in this area. However, less attention has been focused on these effects and their interactions. Here, a field plot experiment was performed based on a completely randomized design to investigate the response of P adsorption-desorption characteristics to the presence/absence of earthworms and straw return. Treatments included: (1) control without earthworms and straw (E0S0); (2) treatment with only earthworms (E1S0); (3) treatment with only straw (E0S1); (4) treatment with both earthworms and straw. The Langmuir model was superior to the Freundlich model in interpreting the P adsorption data and allowed better evaluation of the maximum P adsorption values. The maximal P adsorption, P adsorption affinity constant, and maximum buffer capacity in the earthworm and straw treatments were 2.4-8.3%, 8.3-13.9%, and 2.2-26.3% lower than those in E0S0. The readily desorbable P, standard P requirement, and degree of P saturation increased by 15.6-44.3%, 13.1-23.1%, and 4.4-16.5%, respectively, in earthworm and straw treatments. Additionally, earthworm inoculation and straw return treatments significantly increased total soil P, Olsen P, soil organic carbon, free Fe2O3, and CaCO3 contents and specific surface area of the soil. Redundancy analysis showed that soil organic carbon explained most (14.7%) of the total variation in P adsorption and desorption. These results show that combining earthworm inoculation with straw return can effectively reduce soil P adsorption capacity, increase its P desorption capacity, and thus, increase its available P content. These results provide a scientific basis for improving the utilization efficiency of soil P.					wang, chen/JED-7289-2023; wu, yunhui/JGD-6838-2023; lin, qing/JED-5250-2023; Wang, lingyu/JLM-2013-2023														0301-4797	1095-8630				JUN 15	2022	312								114921	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114921	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114921		MAR 2022						35334401					WOS:000795141700003

The aim of this study was to gain insight into how the hypothalamus regulates energy homoeostasis in Tibetan sheep. We compared Tibetan and Small-tailed Han sheep (n 24 of each breed), which were each allocated randomly into four groups and offered one of four diets that differed in digestible energy densities: 8 center dot 21, 9 center dot 33, 10 center dot 45 and 11 center dot 57 MJ/kg DM. Sheep were weighed every 2 weeks, and it was assumed that the change in body weight (BW) reflected the change in energy balance. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus in Tibetan sheep had greater protein expressions of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) when in negative energy balance, but lesser protein expressions of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) when in positive energy balance than Small-tailed Han sheep. As a result, Tibetan sheep had a lesser BW loss when in negative energy balance and stored more energy and gained more BW when in positive energy balance than Small-tailed Han sheep with the same dietary intake. Moreover, in the hypothalamic adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulation pathway, Tibetan sheep had greater adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-alpha 2 protein expression than Small-tailed Han sheep, which supported the premise of a better ability to regulate energy homoeostasis and better growth performance. These differences in the hypothalamic NPY/AgRP, POMC/CART and AMPK pathways between breeds conferred an advantage to the Tibetan over Small-tailed Han sheep to cope with low energy intake on the harsh QTP.

Evaluation of increased feed supply and different fattening strategies for an Ethiopian sheep population by system dynamics modelling	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE												Context. The productivity of Ethiopian smallholder farms is considered to be low owing to different factors such as feed shortage, lack of breeding strategies, disease prevalence and missing marketing strategies. Aim. The main objective of the study was to develop a dynamic, stochastic herd model by adopting system dynamic modelling methodology for evaluation of the effect of increased feed availability (forage production) in combination with different fattening strategies on herd dynamics and profitability of an Ethiopian sheep population. Methods. Forage production utilising part of smallholder farmers' cropland was built into a dynamic simulation model. Two alternative feed-supply systems were evaluated: turning 25% and 50% of the current cropland into area used for forage production. The simulation period was 20 years, the first 10 years representing the baseline fattening scenario (culled rams fattened). For the last 10 years, genetic selection was introduced and two scenarios were evaluated: fattening of culled rams (Scenario I) and fattening of young rams (Scenario II). Key results. Increasing the feed supply resulted in an increase to the herd size when the model balanced dry matter supply and demand of the herd. Fattening of young rams (Scenario II) with genetic selection was significantly more profitable than the baseline and Scenario I in both of the simulated alternative feed-supply systems. This can be used for regular cash generation, which might reduce disposal of animals at lower price in cases of need for emergency cash. Conclusions. Overall, the simulation model demonstrates that production of improved forage crops should be combined with selective breeding and an appropriate finishing strategy. The competition for resources (land and labour) with crop production, forage seed shortage and extended family size are other challenges raised by smallholder farmers for the feasibility of the two alternative feed-supply systems.

Here we report the genome sequence of peanut and show that after its polyploid origin, the genome has evolved through mobile-element activity, deletions and by the flow of genetic information between corresponding ancestral chromosomes (that is, homeologous recombination). Uniformity of patterns of homeologous recombination at the ends of chromosomes favors a single origin for cultivated peanut and its wild counterpart A. monticola. However, through much of the genome, homeologous recombination has created diversity. Using new polyploid hybrids made from the ancestral species, we show how this can generate phenotypic changes such as spontaneous changes in the color of the flowers. We suggest that diversity generated by these genetic mechanisms helped to favor the domestication of the polyploid A. hypogaea over other diploid Arachis species cultivated by humans.

J	Zhang, Y; Dong, LB; Shangguan, ZP				Zhang, Yu; Dong, Lingbo; Shangguan, Zhouping			Appropriate N addition improves soil aggregate stability through AMF and glomalin-related soil proteins in a semiarid agroecosystem	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Soil aggregation and structural stability play a crucial role in soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration. However, the underlying mechanisms of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) responses to N addition and their impacts on soil aggregation and organic carbon stability remain unclear. Hence, a 16-year field N addition experiment on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was conducted to investigate the effects on the stability of soil structure and SOC fractions via AMF and GRSP. Overall, N addition increased the soil aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD), which exhibited an increase in the proportion of large macroaggregates and a decrease in the proportion of silt-clay fractions. Appropriate N (180 kg N ha(-1)) input increased SOC stability and total SOC stock, while excessive N (360 kg N ha(-1)) input increased labile organic carbon fractions, and active C index and decreased the C stock. The concentrations of SOC, total GRSP (T-GRSP), and easily extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) showed the largest increases in small macroaggregates, and GRSP was significantly correlated with SOC, recalcitrant organic carbon, and MWD (p < 0.05). These results indicated that appropriate N addition promoted AMF to secrete GRSP, which in turn favoured large macroaggregation and enhanced the physical protection of SOC. Meanwhile, the increased GRSP stimulated the accumulation of recalcitrant C, thus improving soil organic carbon stability and carbon sequestration capacity. The study suggested that appropriate N addition (180 kg N ha(-1)) should be used to improve the carbon sequestration potential of farmland on the Loess Plateau.						zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310													1085-3278	1099-145X				FEB 15	2023	34	3					710	722		10.1002/ldr.4488	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4488		OCT 2022											WOS:000875695900001

The results clearly indicated that water deficit significantly reduced the relative water content, chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents and increased malondialdehyde, electrolyte leakage, and antioxidant activities. The responses of tarragon accessions to water deficit, however, were inconsistent. The HPLC analysis revealed the presence of chlorogenic, syringic, ferulic, vanillic, chicoric, and p-coumaric acids as major phenolic acids, while quercetin and herniarin were detected as the predominant flavonoid and coumarin compounds in the extracts. Our findings revealed that the water deficit not only increased the amounts of herniarin, luteolin, apigenin, caffeic acid, and syringic acid, but also introduced quercetin that was not present under normal conditions in Estahbanat. Nevertheless, these results were highly impacted by the accession type. The results indicated that Hamadan, Varamin and Estahbanat accessions could be introduced as tolerant accessions. Given the very different responses of tarragon accessions to water deficit and the diversity between these accessions, the findings of the present study could be an effective step in identifying and achieving homogeneous, drought-tolerant and high-yield potential accessions, and may help tarragon breeding programs as well as development of cultivation.

Little is known about the responses of delta C-13 and delta N-15 to alpine grassland degradation on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which prevents a full understanding of degradation-induced changes in C and N cycling there. We investigated the vegetation delta C-13 and delta N-15, soil delta C-13 and delta N-15, soil properties, and plant community composition of alpine grassland on the QTP that were in different states of degradation. Our results show that the vegetation delta C-13 and delta N-15, and soil delta C-13 and delta N-15, increased with the severity of degradation, whereas soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N content decreased as degradation became more severe. The aboveground biomass percentage of forbs was positively correlated with the soil C/N ratio, vegetation delta C-13, and soil delta C-13, and accounted for the largest proportion of the variance for both vegetation delta C-13 and soil delta C-13 (17.25 and 23.65%, respectively). The vegetation delta N-15 and soil delta N-15 were negatively correlated with the soil C/N ratio, which explained the largest proportion of the variance (18.01 and 25.81%, respectively). Our results suggest that C cycling is strongly moderated by plant community composition, because forbs species and C-4 species, were more prevalent in degraded alpine grassland. Meanwhile, N cycling is indirectly regulated by changes in community composition via its effect on the soil C/N as the degradation became more severe for alpine grassland on the QTP.					xue, xue/JTV-1627-2023; Wang, Tao/AGJ-1581-2022	Wang, Tao/0000-0002-2892-1050; Li, Chengyang/0000-0001-7166-8313													1085-3278	1099-145X				APR 30	2021	32	7					2371	2382		10.1002/ldr.3912	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3912		MAR 2021											WOS:000626534700001

In this study, rumen inocula from Tibetan sheep (TBI) and from Small-tailed Han sheep (HSI) were incubated in in vitro batch cultures in five ratios (TBI: HSI): 0:100, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25 or 100:0 for 72 h. With an increasing proportion of TBI, there was a linear decrease (P < 0.001) in gas and CH4 production on a degraded dry matter (DM) basis at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. In addition, increasing the proportion of TBI increased the digestibility of DM (P < 0.05), neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber and total and individual volatile fatty acids (VFA) concentrations at almost all time points. An increase in the TBI: HSI ratio resulted in less metabolic hydrogen ([2H]) incorporated into CH4 and more into propionate. The recovery of [2H] consistently decreased with an increase in the TBI: HSI ratio, indicating the existence of unaccounted [2H] in TBI. It would be important to study the rumen microbiome in Tibetan sheep with the use of classical microbiology and modern -omics techniques to identify [2H] sinks alternative to CH4, which could perhaps be stimulated in other domestic ruminants.

Intense rainfall with long duration is frequently associated with lahar flow. In this study, estimation of a rainfall threshold likely to trigger lahar flow is presented in the first part. The second part discusses its implementation by assessing the growth of observed and predicted rainfall, including the uncertainties. The study area is Merapi Volcano, one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia, including rivers on the flank of Mount Merapi that are vulnerable to debris flow. The rainfall indices needed to describe the conditions that generate lahars or not were determined empirically by evaluating the hourly and working rainfall using X-band multiparameter (X-MP) weather radar. Using past records of lahar flow, the threshold lines separating rainfall that triggers lahars or not were analyzed for the Putih, Gendol, Pabelan, and Krasak Rivers. The performance of several critical lines was evaluated using Bayesian probability based on skill rates from a contingency matrix. The study shows that the line intercept of the critical lines after a significant eruption in 2010 was higher than those lines developed before 2010, indicating that the rivers are currently at lesser risk. Good representation was shown by the thresholds verified with actual rainfall progression and lahar event information on February 17, 2016, at the Gendol and Pabelan Rivers. These rainfall critical lines were the basis for judging the debris flow occurrence by an-alyzing the track record of predicted rainfall progression. The uncertainty of rainfall short-term prediction from the extrapolation model was evaluated by perturbing the advection vector of rain echo motion. This ensemble forecast product could provide a plausible range of prediction possibility as assistance in gaining the confidence with which a lahar could be predicted. The scheme presented herein could serve as a useful tool for a lahar early warning system in the area of the Merapi Volcano.

As one of the most populous areas in China's river basins, the surface water in the Huai River Basin has significant impacts on agricultural plants, ecological balance, and socioeconomic development. However, it is unclear how water areas responded to climate change and anthropogenic water exploitation in the past decades. To understand the changes in water surface areas in the Huai River Basin, this study used the available 16,760 scenes Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images in this region from 1989 to 2017 and processed the data on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The vegetation index and water index were used to quantify the spatiotemporal variability of the surface water area changes over the years. The major results include: (1) The maximum area, the average area, and the seasonal variation of surface water in the Huai River Basin showed a downward trend in the past 29 years, and the year-long surface water areas showed a slight upward trend; (2) the surface water area was positively correlated with precipitation (p < 0.05), but was negatively correlated with the temperature and evapotranspiration; (3) the changes of the total area of water bodies were mainly determined by the 216 larger water bodies (>10 km(2)). Understanding the variations in water body areas and the controlling factors could support the designation and implementation of sustainable water management practices in agricultural, industrial, and domestic usages.

Molecular and Physiological Alterations in Chickpea under Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations	PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY												The present study reports profiling of the elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration responsive global transcriptome in chickpea, along with a combinatorial approach for exploring interlinks between physiological and transcriptional changes, important for the climate change scenario. Various physiological parameters were recorded in two chickpea cultivars (JG 11 and KAK 2) grown in open top chambers under ambient [380parts per million (ppm)] and two stressed/elevated CO2 concentrations (550 and 700ppm), at different stages of plant growth. The elevated CO2 concentrations altered shoot and root length, nodulation (number of nodules), total chlorophyll content and nitrogen balance index, significantly. RNA-Seq from 12 tissues representing vegetative and reproductive growth stages of both cultivars under ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations identified 18,644 differentially expressed genes including 9,687 transcription factors (TF). The differential regulations in genes, gene networks and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) -derived expression dynamics of stress-responsive TFs were observed in both cultivars studied. A total of 138 pathways, mainly involved in sugar/starch metabolism, chlorophyll and secondary metabolites biosynthesis, deciphered the crosstalk operating behind the responses of chickpea to elevated CO2 concentration.

Here, we ask if these factors are involved in shaping temporal variations in scent emission. To that end, we coupled light/dark floral emission measurements of 17 desert Brassicaceae species with environmental and phylogenetic data to explore the individual/combined impacts of these predictors on diel emission patterns. We further investigated these patterns by conducting high-resolution emission measurements in a subset of genetically distant species with contrasting temporal dynamics. While diel shifts in magnitude and richness of emission were strongly affected by genetic relatedness, they also reflect the environmental conditions under which the species grow. Specifically, light/dark emission ratios were negatively affected by an increase in winter temperatures, known to impact both plant physiology and insect locomotion, and sandy soil fractions, previously shown to exert stress that tempers with diel metabolic rhythms. Additionally, the biosynthetic origins of the compounds were associated with their corresponding production patterns, possibly to maximize emission efficacy. Using a multidisciplinary chemical/ecological approach, we uncover and differentiate the main factors shaping floral scent diel fluctuations, highlighting their consequences under changing global climate.

Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis of 3883 paired observations from 220 studies. Overall, biochar application significantly increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (7.4%) and yield (9.4%) and decreased soil methane (CH4, -13.0%) and nitrous oxide (N2O, -26.8%) emissions, as well as GWP (-7.7%) and GHGI (-14.3%). CH4 uptake was, however, not observed to change. The responses of soil GHG fluxes to the biochar application were more sensitive in the incubation and pot experiments compared to the field studies. In addition, increased CO2 emissions were mainly derived from incubation and pot experiments, whereas the biochar application did not significantly change CO2 emissions in the field studies. The climate, soil, and experimental conditions also affected the responses of soil GHG fluxes to biochar application, and the biochar-induced change in soil pH was the most essential factor associated with the variations in soil GHG fluxes. Globally, biochar application boosted the soil carbon (C) pool (38.1% in upland and 33.4% in paddy) and decreased soil GHGI (-18.7% in upland and -14.5% in paddy). Our study highlights the role of the reduced CH4 and N2O emissions in the biochar-induced mitigation of soil GHG emissions while exploring the relative importance of the influencing factors and providing crucial insights for the development of individualized biochar management measures.

Little is known about the properties of river sediment that is transported by hyperconcentrated flows, particularly with respect to the mineral composition and size distribution. Samples of sediment and loess were collected in the northern, middle, and southern Loess Plateau and the mainstream and tributaries of the MLYR. A total of 18 loess samples and 24 river sediment samples were analyzed to determine their sediment size distribution and mineral composition. The bottom loess samples reflected the original sedimentary features of the Loess Plateau, and the median particle size reduced, and the clay content increased from the north to the south of the study region. The surface loess has been weathered under the action of wind and rainfall, and the clay particle content in the surface loess samples was higher than that in the undisturbed bottom loess. Erosion of the surface soil due to rainfall and surface runoff means that fine particles (mostly clay) have been washed away. The median diameter of surface loess particles was a little larger than that of the bottom loess particles where water erosion dominates. The particle size became coarser with increasing distance from the estuary in the MLYR, which reflects depositional sorting in the river channel. Significant logarithmic relations were found between the median diameter of the sediment particles and the i) non-clay mineral content and ii) clay mineral content. Thus, clay and non-clay mineral compositions can be conveniently estimated from the particle size distribution.

Quantification of carbon and water resource consumption and coupling be-tween plant organs is poorly understood but important for predicting carbon and water coupled processes in grassland ecosystem drought responses. We determined the correlations between water transport parameters and carbon allocation in leaves, stems, branches, and roots of the grass Bothriochloa ischaemum, sampled 0, 6, 24, 48, 216, and 360 h after 13C -18O pulse-labeling under three drought treatments: control (CK), mild stress (MS) and serious stress (SS). We found that: (1) The sum of 13C in roots, soil, and rhizosphere soil was higher than the amount of 13C respired by roots under all treatments. The ratio of stored to respired 13C in the SS had a significantly lower than CK, indicating that the underground grass-soil system was a carbon sink rather than a carbon source. (2) 216 h after the application of 18O-labeled water, the proportion of 18O-labeled water in the aboveground portion of plants was up to 60% under MS, significantly greater than under SS (36.5%) and under CK (45.9%). Root density was mainly distributed in the 0-15 cm soil layer under mild drought stress. Both results suggest that grasses respond to mild drought by increasing topsoil root density to absorb soil water and improve the water transfer ratio to the aboveground portion of the plants. (3) During the double-labeling experiment, the ratio of 13C accumulated to 18O consumed in roots under mild drought was significantly higher than in other treatments. In contrast, these ratios in old leaves and stems under drought were significantly lower than in the control treatment, indicating that B.ischaemum experiences a trade-off between increasing root carbon and water utilization and reducing old leaf and stem carbon and water utilization under mild drought stress.

However, the comprehensive evaluation of the water and sediment regimes and its potential attribution at the regional scale are limited. In this study, the hydrological characteristics and in-reach sediment budget in the Coarse Sandy Hilly Catchments (CSHC) region and their potential attribution were investigated by using data from hydrological stations in the mainstream and tributaries and data from soil and water conservation measures (SWCMs) in different river reaches. The results indicated that the runoff and sediment load of the mainstream showed obvious spatial heterogeneity, both of which revealed a very significant decreasing trend from 1956 to 2018 (P < 0.01). The spatial heterogeneity of sediment load along the mainstream was more obvious than that of streamflow, and the Toudaoguai and Fugu stations had the largest difference in sediment transport trends. During the P1 period (1956-1968), the streamflow of each reach was sufficient, and the riverbeds of the mainstream and channel on both banks were subject to serious scouring. In the P2-P3 period (1969-2018), in-reach water decreased continuously, and the mainstream began to show a process from slight scouring to no scouring and even sediment deposition. Except for climate change being the main factor in streamflow reduction during the P2 period (1969-1999) at the Fugu and Wubao stations, anthropogenic activities were the primary factors leading to the reduction in streamflow and sediment load in the CSHC region. Under the influence of the same measures, the sediment reduction rate in this region was greater than the runoff reduction rate. Furthermore, the SWCMs in different reaches indicated great diversity in the benefits of water and sediment reduction. Therefore, zoning regulation of the CSHC region should be carried out in the future, and the sustainable development of the regional vegetation ecosystem should be maintained.

A new exponential model for predicting soil gas diffusivity with varying degree of saturation	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Soil gas diffusivity (D-p/D-o, gas diffusion coefficients in soil and in free air, respectively) and its relation to soil moisture is of great importance for describing and quantifying essential provisional and regulatory functions associated with terrestrial ecosystems such as soil aeration and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Because gas migration in terrestrial soil systems is predominantly diffusion controlled, soil gas diffusivity becomes a fundamental prerequisite to quantify diffusive gas fluxes. Descriptive-predictive models are often used to estimate D-p/D-o from easily measurable soil physical properties. Most of the available models take the form of power-law functions and often tend to mischaracterize soil moisture effects at high moisture regimes. Based on a wide range D-p/D-o data available in literature representing both intact and repacked soils, this study developed a novel air-saturation-dependent exponential (ASEX) gas diffusivity model to model D-p/D-o in relation to soil air saturation. The model variable alpha, which represents the diffusivity at half air saturation normalized by the same in complete soil air saturation, could potentially differentiate moisture effects on different soil structural states. For specific applications in intact soils, we propose corresponding alpha values for upper-limit (alpha = .6) and lower-limit (alpha = .05) estimates of diffusivity, while an average value (alpha = .3) for general applications in both intact and repacked soils. As expected, our model based on a few a priori measured supportive data showed a better performance over the classical predictive models that do not use such measurements. The new model was further used to derive useful implications to showcase soil density effects on D-p/D-o.

To this end, for a better understanding of the eco-physiology of wild animals, the adrenocortical activity can be non-invasively evaluated by measuring glucocorticoid metabolites excreted in feces. However, to ensure that the endocrine information is reliable, the experimental assays should be first validated and the causes for the major variability among individuals should be considered. Here we validated an enzyme immunoassay for measuring fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) in three wild gerbil species and emphasized the differences among them. These are endangered species, which play a key role in psammophilic communities, and provide a model system for various aspects in ecology. Thus, this work constitutes the first step toward using the FCMs of these species as indicators for individual and community stress. The study of the endocrine status can be useful to understand wildlife responses to the changing environment. Here, we validated an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to non-invasively monitor adrenocortical activity by measuring fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) in three sympatric gerbil species (Gerbillus andersoni, G. gerbillus and G. pyramidum) from the Northwestern Negev Desert's sands (Israel). Animals included into treatment groups were injected with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) to stimulate adrenocortical activity, while control groups received a saline solution. Feces were collected at different intervals and FCM were quantified by an EIA. Basal FCM levels were similar in the three species. The ACTH effect was evidenced, but the time of FCM peak concentrations appearance differed between the species (6-24 h post-injection). Furthermore, FCM peak values were observed sooner in G. andersoni females than in males (6 h and 18 h post-injection, respectively). G. andersoni and G. gerbillus males in control groups also increased FCM levels (18 h and 48 h post-injection, respectively). Despite the small sample sizes, our results confirmed the EIA suitability for analyzing FCM in these species as a reliable indicator of the adrenocortical activity. This study also revealed that close species, and individuals within a species, can respond differently to the same stressor.

Conventional tillage is still widely used in sloping land, which leads to serious soil erosion and land degradation. The effect of tillage on soil erosion is defined by Tillage factor (T) in the model. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of conventional tillage on soil erosion and to calculate the value of the conventional tillage Factor T. The values of the con-ventional tillage factor (T value) were calculated for different soil and water conservation zones in China by collecting published literature and plot measurements from unpublished monitoring sites. The results showed that (1) the tillage factors of conventional tillage in China ranged from 0.27 to 0.55, with the largest being the North earth-stony region, the smallest being the Qinghai-Tibet plateau region, and the other six regions, namely, the Northeastern mollisol, the Northern wind erosion, the Northwest Loess Plateau, the South red soil, the Southwestern purple soil and the Southwestern karst region, were 0.34, 0.28, 0.53, 0.37, 0.35 and 0.29, respectively. In the regional soil erosion evaluation, the values can be taken by each of the eight main erosion type regions. (2) In the water erosion area except for the northeast, there is an obvious north-south difference in the distribution of the T value, showing a decreasing trend from north to south. In practical use, the T value of the corresponding latitude area can be determined according to the Equation T = 0.2351f- 0.02225, where f is the latitude (?). (3) The T values of contour tillage, no-till, and monopoly tillage measures are significantly lower than the T values of conventional tillage, which have significant soil and water conservation benefits. The study initially determined the conventional tillage T values for each water conservation subzone, which can provide basic parameters for soil loss prediction on sloping land.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				JUN 1	2023	348								108407	10.1016/j.agee.2023.108407	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2023.108407		FEB 2023											WOS:001007723100001

The event provided a chance to explore the resilience of vegetation growth and productivity to the extreme drought. Here, we used the self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI) to describe the characteristics of the extreme drought. Vegetation growth and productivity indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), and gross primary productivity (GPP), were applied to analyze the resilience of different vegetation types to the extreme drought. Our results showed that the extreme drought event occurred mainly in Yunnan Province, Guizhou Province, central and northern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and northwestern Sichuan Province. The spatial heterogeneity of the extreme drought was related to the temperature increase and water deficit. During the extreme drought, the vegetation growth and productivity of evergreen broadleaf forest were the least suppressed, whereas cropland was greatly suppressed. The recovery of cropland was higher than that of evergreen broadleaf forest. NDVI and LAI were recovered in more than 80% of the drought-affected area within 5 months, whereas GPP required a longer time to recover. Moreover, the results of multiple linear regression showed that an increase in surface soil moisture was able to significantly improve the resistance of vegetation NDVI and LAI in evergreen broadleaf forest, evergreen needleleaf forest, evergreen broadleaf shrubland, deciduous broadleaf shrubland, and grassland. Our study highlights the differences in the resilience of different vegetation types to extreme drought and indicates that surface soil moisture is an important factor affecting vegetation resistance in SWC.						yu, zhen/0000-0002-7729-249X; Zhang, Yuandong/0000-0002-0413-1775														1999-4907				JUN	2022	13	6							851	10.3390/f13060851	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13060851													WOS:000816155200001

It has become increasingly important to fully exploit yield gaps (the difference between potential and actual yields) of all staple grains and to identify priority areas in order to achieve the UN sustainable development goal of zero hunger by 2030. The objective of this study was to calculate the production and yield gaps for rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and corn (Zea mays L.) across 31 provinces of mainland China, and then to propose sustainable ways to exploit the production and yield gaps in relation to the availability of natural resources and the ecological conditions of the various regions. The yield potential was estimated by assuming that certificated cultivars were adopted in each agricultural ecological zone (AEZ) and that state-of-the-art technologies and best management practices were used. The results suggested that the gross potential productivity of the three staple grains of mainland China in 2016 was 8.86 x 108 tons, with a production gap of 2.99 x 108 tons. Corn exhibited the greatest yield gap. The highest potential productivity was observed in the Northeast Plain and the Huang-Huai-Hai/North China Plain, accounting for 26.35% and 35.91% of the country's total potential productivity, respectively. The greatest yield gaps were also found in these two plains. To narrow yield gaps, farmland infrastructure, especially irrigation facilities, should be improved, and field management should be strengthened for the provinces with the greatest gaps. However, in view of natural resource constraints (e.g., water shortages in Northern China), water-saving measures and techniques have been encouraged throughout mainland China and the planting of high water-consuming crops such as rice has been discouraged and should be reduced and replaced by other crops in the North China Plain and Northwest China. Using presently available cultivars and field management technologies, China still has great potential to increase grain production and improve food security by closing exploitable yield gaps through the use of suitable production methods based on existing natural resource capacity and ecological status.																			0264-8377	1873-5754				JUN	2022	117								106080	10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.106080		MAR 2022											WOS:000780383300002

Research suggests that long-term monocropping may lead to soil ecological disorders. In this study, we aimed to understand the reasons for the decrease in plant productivity stemming from long-term monoculture cropping. Greenhouse studies were conducted to determine the cause of continuous cropping (CC) obstacles in soils under 12 years of continuous strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) production. The data suggested that CC led to three phases of changes in abiotic and biotic soil factors. In phase I (CC for 2-6 years), significant changes were observed only in soil physicochemical properties, such as the pH, total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK) and soil organic matter (SOM), which obviously changed from the second year to the sixth year. In phase II (CC for 6-8 years), two biotic factors, key fungi such as Fusarium, Humicola and Arthrobotrys and soil nematodes, i.e., populations and communities of nematodes, started to change significantly in terms of their abundance. In phase III (CC for 8 years), the accumulation of phenolic acids, i.e., p-hydroxybenzoic acid (p-HBA), ferulic acid (FA), p-coumaric acid (p-CA) and cinnamic acid (CA), significantly inhibited crop growth, and the abundance of key bacteria, including Bacillus, Sphingomonas and Sphingopyxis, started to change significantly from the eighth CC year. The results in this study provide useful information for solving CC obstacles in strawberry production.					li, heqin/AAN-9429-2020; li, weihua/AAR-6652-2020	li, weihua/0000-0003-0861-0092													0929-1393	1873-0272				NOV	2020	155								103626	10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.103626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2020.103626													WOS:000560743700003

Yaks do not receive supplementary feed whereas cattle require supplementary feed during harsh winter. We hypothesized that yaks would cope with the severe conditions of the QTP better than cattle and utilize the pasture more efficiently. We also hypothesized that differences between species would be pronounced in winter, when conditions are particularly harsh. To test these hypotheses, seasonal rumen fluid parameters of yaks, C x Y and cattle (n = 3 for each) were examined. Rumen fluid was collected in summer and winter from each genotype 2, 5 and 12 hr after a day of grazing. Concentrations of total volatile fatty acid (VFA), acetate, propionate, isobutyrate and isovalerate were greater in yaks than in cattle in summer (p < 0.05), while propionate concentration was lower in yaks than in cattle in winter (p < 0.05). Concentrations of ammonia and urea were greater (p < 0.001) in yaks than in cattle (p < 0.001) in summer, whereas, concentrations of free amino acids ( AA) were greater in cattle than in yaks in summer and winter (p < 0.001). Concentrations of total VFA, acetate, propionate and butyrate decreased linearly ( p < 0.05), whereas concentrations of isobutyrate and isovalerate increased linearly for yak and C x Y with sampling time (p < 0.05) in summer. In summer, concentrations of isobutyrate and isovalerate were greater in yaks than in cattle ( p < 0.05). In conclusion, rumen fermentation characteristics of yaks showed that they coped better than cattle or C x Y in the harsh climate as we hypothesized. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, this emerged only in summer, when pasture was plentiful and not in winter, when pasture was scarce.

Construction of a high-density genetic map and QTL analysis for yield, yield components and agronomic traits in chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i> L.)	PLOS ONE												Unravelling the genetic architecture underlying yield components and agronomic traits is important for enhancing crop productivity. Here, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, developed from ICC 4958 and DCP 92-3 cross, was used for constructing linkage map and QTL mapping analysis. The RIL population was genotyped using a high-throughput Axiom((R))CicerSNP array, which enabled the development of a high-density genetic map consisting of 3,818 SNP markers and spanning a distance of 1064.14 cM. Analysis of phenotyping data for yield, yield components and agronomic traits measured across three years together with genetic mapping data led to the identification of 10 major-effect QTLs and six minor-effect QTLs explaining up to 59.70% phenotypic variance. The major-effect QTLs identified for 100-seed weight, and plant height possessed key genes, such as C3HC4 RING finger protein, pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, sugar transporter, leucine zipper protein and NADH dehydrogenase, amongst others. The gene ontology studies highlighted the role of these genes in regulating seed weight and plant height in crop plants. The identified genomic regions for yield, yield components, and agronomic traits, and the closely linked markers will help advance genetics research and breeding programs in chickpea.

We first examined the power relationship between the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor f and the Reynolds number Re to obtain the values of the K coefficient and b exponent. These results confirmed the applicability of the values of b suggested in literature, while K required a specific calibration for laminar open-channel flows. The analysis revealed that transition from a laminar to turbulent flow regime for water only flows occurred at a threshold value of Re equal to 500 as described historically. The estimate of f by the power relationship and the calibrated b and K values were reliable for water only runs when Re >= 500. The measurements were also used to test a theoretical flow resistance law based on a power-velocity distribution. The calibrated theoretical relationship between the velocity profile parameter gamma(v), bed slope, flow Froude number and Re enabled a good estimate off for water flows. For mixed fluid flows, the effect of the velocity profile shape was considered calibrating this relationship by two datasets obtained setting a threshold Reynolds number equal to 7. For flows with Re < 7, the shape of the velocity profile can be linear or convex while for flows at Re >= 7 the shape of the velocity distribution is always concave. The theoretical flow resistance allowed an accurate estimate also for mixed fluid flows, even at Re < 7. The different shape of the power-velocity distribution highlighted that mixed flows behave differently as compared to water only flows.					wang, jie/HTQ-4920-2023; wang, jiajun/JRW-6032-2023; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022; ZHOU, YUE/IZE-6277-2023; wang, jing/HJA-5384-2022; Nicosia, Alessio/AAD-9145-2021; wang, juan/IUO-6218-2023; wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; Wang, Jing/IQW-3496-2023; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; wang, dan/JEF-0836-2023; wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023; wang, jian/HRB-9588-2023; wang, xu/IAN-4886-2023	Nicosia, Alessio/0000-0003-0540-8788; Wang, Jing/0000-0002-8296-2961; Ferro, Vito/0000-0003-3020-3119													0022-1694	1879-2707				APR	2022	607								127555	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127555	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.127555		FEB 2022											WOS:000790501300003

However, inoculation effects vary, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Two maize genotypes (JD52, salt-tolerant with large root system, and FSY1, salt-sensitive with small root system) inoculated with or without AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae were grown in pots containing soil amended with 0 or 100 mM NaCl (incrementally added 32 days after sowing, DAS) in a greenhouse. Plants were assessed 59 DAS for plant growth, tissue Na+ and K+ contents, the expression of plant transporter genes responsible for Na+ and/or K+ uptake, translocation or compartmentation, and chloroplast ultrastructure alterations. Results Under 100 mM NaCl, AM plants of both genotypes grew better with denser root systems than non-AM plants. Relative to non-AM plants, the accumulation of Na+ and K+ was decreased in AM plant shoots but increased in AM roots with a decrease in the shoot: root Na+ ratio particularly in FSY1, accompanied by differential regulation of ion transporter genes (i.e., ZmSOS1, ZmHKT1, and ZmNHX). This induced a relatively higher Na+ efflux (recirculating) rate than K+ in AM shoots while the converse outcoming (higher Na+ influx rate than K+) in AM roots. The higher K+: Na+ ratio in AM shoots contributed to the maintenance of structural and functional integrity of chloroplasts in mesophyll cells.

The aim of our research is study of the effect of soil moisture regime on the species richness and biomass of the herb layer for old-growth coniferous forests in the Ural Mountains (Russia). The research has been carried out between 57 degrees 00'N; 60 degrees 15"E and 57 degrees 05'N; 60 degrees 25'E. The studied area is part of the Zauralsky hilly piedmont province, the Southern boreal forest region. Sample plots (0.25 hectares) were laid in pine forests growing in habitats with different moisture regimes: insufficient, optimal (stable), and excessive. The research was conducted in 2010. To determine the herb layer productivity, 10-20 subplots 1x1 m in size were laid on each sample plot. Data analysis is based on the One-way ANOVA and species abundance distributions. It has been established that species richness in extreme (insufficient and excessive soil moisture regime (Cowberry pine forest and Pine forest with shrubs and sphagnum) and optimal (stable) soil moisture regime (Multi-herb pine forest) were found to vary significantly, with soil moisture regime being a statistically significant factor. By contrast, herb layer biomass is maintained fairly stable regardless of the soil moisture regimes. ANOVA showed no significant differences between pine forests growing under different soil moisture regimes. It has been found that biomass is maintained by increasing of the dominant species contribution to the overall biomass and increasing of the approximation function graph slope. At the same time, the parameter beta of exponential and power approximating functions is increased and can be considered as an indicator of influencing on forest ecosystems and a measure of their adaptation to insufficient and excessive soil moisture. Thus, species abundance distributions can be used as method to measure the effects of factors that determine forest ecosystem composition and functioning.

Along a sampling transect running from northeast to southwest through 10 climbing dunes and two falling dunes in the Langsailing area, the surface sediments were sampled to analyse the grain-size characteristics, to clarify the transport pattern of particles with different grain sizes, and to discuss the effects of terrain factors including dune slope, mountain slope, elevation and transport distance to sand transport. Sand dunes on both sides of the ridge are mainly transverse dunes. Fine and medium sands were the main particles, with few very fine and coarse particles in the surface sediments. Particles > 4.00 Phi were blown upslope by suspension, particles 1.00-4.00 Phi were mainly transported upslope by saltation with opposite change tendency, and particles <1.00 Phi mainly moved by creep were found almost exclusively at the bottom of the slopes. As terrain factors, elevation and transport distance were more important factors influencing the distribution of grain size and particle fraction on dunes. Local winds observation might be helpful for the transport mechanism study of particles on climbing and falling dunes, while the wind data from nearby weather station was hardly helpful.																			2347-4327	0973-774X				FEB	2019	128	1							11	10.1007/s12040-018-1030-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-018-1030-4													WOS:000451759900003

Here, we analysed Posidonia oceanica from six sites within and around the Stagnone di Marsala, a semi-enclosed coastal lagoon where salinity and temperature exceed the generally described tolerance thresholds of the species. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were measured and plant samples were collected for the assessment of morphology, flowering rate and for screening genome-wide polymorphisms using double digest restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing. Results demonstrated more extreme SSTs and salinity levels inside the lagoon than the outer lagoon regions. Morphological results showed significantly fewer and shorter leaves and reduced rhizome growth of P. oceanica from the inner lagoon and past flowering events were recorded only for a meadow farthest away from the lagoon. Using an array of 51,329 single nucleotide polymorphisms, we revealed a clear genetic structure among the study sites and confirmed the genetic isolation and high clonality of the innermost site. In all, 14 outlier loci were identified and annotated with several proteins including those relate to plant stress response, protein transport and regulators of plant-specific developmental events. Especially, five outlier loci showed maximum allele frequency at the innermost site, likely reflecting adaptation to the extreme temperature and salinity regimes, possibly due to the selection of more resistant genotypes and the progressive restriction of gene flow. Overall, this study helps us to disentangle the genetic basis of seagrass adaptation to local environmental conditions and may support future works on assisted evolution in seagrasses.

Simulated rainfall experiments were conducted on plots of biocrust to simultaneously measure the rates of splash detachment and sheet erosion with 0%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 80% of coverage at 90 mm h-1 rainfall intensity and 15 degrees slope. The splash detachment rate decreased rapidly during the first 5 min of rainfall and stabilised as rainfall continued, while the sheet erosion rate increased gradually and eventually became relatively stable. The rates of splash detachment and sheet erosion decreased substantially as biocrusts coverage increased and average values of them can be effectively weakened when bio-crusts coverage increased from 20% to 40%. Transport-limited processes, dynamic equi-libria between detachment-and transport-limited processes, and detachment-limited processes all occurred on biocrustal slope within the same rainfall event. The mean duration of transport-limited processes was longer (16.3 min vs. 9.1 min) when bare slopes were covered by biocrusts, and the latest change in the time from transport-limited to detachment-limited processes appeared at 40% biocrusts coverage. The existence of bio-crusts could effectively affect the sheet erosion and its detachment-and transport-limited processes, especially when the coverage was close to 40%. These results can improve our understanding of impacts of biocrusts on sheet erosion processes, and aid an effective way of reducing sheet erosion in arid and semiarid regions.(c) 2022 IAgrE.

Here, 79 lines from Tunisian Brachypodium hybridum populations were cultivated in two contrasting phosphorus (P) availability levels, and their genetic variation was investigated using forage quality traits to identify the mechanisms governing their genetic variation. Results revealed large variation among populations for most traits and separation between coastal and inland populations in both P levels. All traits revealed high heritability, and the response of most traits to P deficiency was influenced by the population effect which accounted 52.38% of the variation, indicating strong population differentiation. Although significant for most traits, only 18.13% of variation was attributed to P treatment, suggesting little plastic response to P deficiency. However, the lack of population x treatment effect for most traits suggested a common plastic response in populations. Moreover, 56.99% of variation was attributed to environmental factors with distance to coastline, precipitation seasonality, and annual precipitation being the major factors, suggesting that the strong population differentiation reflects local adaptation to specific environments. Contrary to coastal populations characterized by high levels of fiber-related traits, the inland ones displayed high values of most energy-related traits, suggesting that these latter were characterized by higher forage quality. Overall, our results suggested that the effect of local adaptation overrides the effect of phenotypic plasticity regarding the variation of forage quality traits, indicating a broad adaptive genetic differentiation among the populations of B. hybridum in response to P deficiency.

In this study, the relationship between extreme rainfall indices (ERIs) and rainfall erosivity was examined across the Alpine region in New South Wales (NSW) and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the surrounding areas including Murray and Murrumbidgee and South East and Tablelands (SET). Rainfall erosivity, hillslope erosion, and their changes were estimated in the future periods using the revised universal soil loss equation and the NSW/ACT Regional Climate Modeling (NARCliM) projections. Results from the study demonstrate a good relationship between ERIs (especially Rx5Day) and rainfall erosivity. The rainfall erosivity and hillslope erosion are projected to increase about 2 and 8% for the near future (2020-2039), further increase to 8 and 18% for the far future (2060-2079) in the Alpine region assuming the groundcover is maintained at the current condition. The change in rainfall erosivity and erosion risk is highly uneven in space and in season with the highest erosion risk in summer with an increase about 33% in the next 50 years. The highest erosion risk area is predicted within SET (maximum rate 19.95 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), but on average, the ACT has the highest erosion rate, which is above 1.36 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) in all periods. The snowmelt in spring in the Alpine region is estimated to increase the rainfall erosivity by 13% in the baseline period, up to 24% in the near future, but far less (about 1%) in the far future due to predicted temperature rise and less snow available in the Alpine region in the next 50 years.					yang, xihua/AAD-9855-2022; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009	Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Ji, Fei/0000-0002-0230-9189; Zhu, Qinggaozi/0000-0002-2371-4626; Yang, Xihua/0000-0002-5990-2186; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908													0899-8418	1097-0088				FEB	2020	40	2					1213	1227		10.1002/joc.6266	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.6266		SEP 2019											WOS:000483668400001

However, the socio-economic effects are not considered due to the lack of detailed information about this. Here we used a well-validated remote sensing model and multiple socio-economic factors to investigate the driving factors of ET changes over the Loess Plateau during 1982-2012. Results showed that the modeled annual ET significantly increased by similar to 2 mm yr(-2) during this period (p < 0.001), caused by increased transpiration (2.16 mm yr(-2)) and interception (0.27 mm yr(-2)), which was partly offset by decreased soil evaporation (-0.47 mm yr(-2)). Meanwhile, although the average ET of the forest was larger (480.4 +/- 14.8 mm yr(-1)), it was found that the change in total ET of the region was dominated by that in grassland and cropland (1.1 km(3) yr(-2), 90% altogether). Factorial simulations indicated that the intensifying ET over 79.4% and 9.1% of the study area can be explained by vegetation greening and climate change, respectively. Further analysis suggested that the vegetation greening and the increased ET were primarily associated with the rapid urbanization and agricultural intensification. Our findings highlight the potential unfavorable effects of socio-economic activities on water resources management on this coupled natural-human system that is already facing water scarcity issues.

REMOTE SENSING												Precipitation serves as a crucial factor in the study of hydrometeorology, ecology, and the atmosphere. Gridded precipitation data are available from a multitude of sources including precipitation retrieved by satellites, radar, the output of numerical weather prediction models, and extrapolation by ground rain gauge data. Evaluating different types of products in ungauged regions with complex terrain will not only help researchers in applying scientific data, but also provide useful information that can be used to improve gridded precipitation products. The present study aims to evaluate comprehensively 12 precipitation datasets made by raw retrieved products, blended with rain gauge data, and blended multiple source datasets in multi-temporal scales in order to develop a suitable method for creating gridded precipitation data in regions with snow-dominated regions with complex terrain. The results show that the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation with Gauge Adjusted (GSMaP_GAUGE), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM_3B42), Climate Prediction Center Morphing Technique blended with Chinese observations (CMORPH_SUN), and Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) can represent the spatial pattern of precipitation in arid/semi-arid and humid/semi-humid areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau on a climatological spatial pattern. On interannual, seasonal, and monthly scales, the TRMM_3B42, GSMaP_GAUGE, CMORPH_SUN, and MSWEP outperformed the other products. In general, the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN_CCS) has poor performance in basins of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Most products overestimated the extreme indices of the 99(th) percentile of precipitation (R-99), the maximal of daily precipitation in a year (Rmax), and the maximal of pentad accumulation of precipitation in a year (R(5d)max). They were underestimated by the extreme index of the total number of days with daily precipitation less than 1 mm (dry day, DD). Compared to products blended with rain gauge data only, MSWEP blended with more data sources, and outperformed the other products. Therefore, multi-sources of blended precipitation should be the hotspot of regional and global precipitation research in the future.

Despite this, limited research attention was given to the nutritional and antinutritional profiling of sorghum. Thus, this research was initiated to profile and evaluate the variabilities in protein, starch, minerals, flavonoid, tannin, and antioxidant activities among sorghum landraces of Tigray, northern Ethiopia. Protein and starch were analyzed using an infrared spectrophotometer, whereas mineral elements were estimated using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Antioxidant activity was analyzed using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging, ferric-reducing antioxidant power, and phosphomolybdenum assays. The result revealed significant variation among the landraces for all the evaluated parameters. Protein and starch contents ranged from 6.21 to 18% and 33.42 to 78.30%, respectively. Wider variations were observed for Fe (32-101), Zn (16.9-42.98), Cu (1.48-5.25), Mn (9.21-20.23), and Cr (0-1.5) as measured in mg/100 g. The variabilities were high for total flavonoid (0-665 mg CE/g) and tannin (0.18-7.5 mgCE/100 g). DPPH (EC50 = 29.09-818.37 mu g/mL), ferric reducing antioxidant power (17.85-334.81 mgAAE/g), and total antioxidant activity (1.71-63.88 mgBHTE/g) were also highly variable among the samples. The relationship between seed color and phenolics, as well as antioxidant activities, are discussed. Multivariate analysis revealed that the landraces were clustered into four distinct groups. The rich genetic diversity in the nutritional and antinutritional attributes may be an opportunity for breeding for grain quality improvements of sorghum that, in turn, helps in addressing malnutrition.

Previous research mainly focused on quantifying soil detachment, while few studies have analyzed the soil detachment variation mechanism and its dominant factors under different land uses. The objective of this study was to investigate the response mechanism of the soil detachment capacity (SDC) to hydrodynamic parameters and root-soil composite properties across different land uses. Undisturbed soil samples were collected from four different land uses (cropland, orchard, grassland and woodland). The samples were subjected to flow scouring through hydraulic flume experiments under six different stream powers. The results showed that the SDC of cropland and orchard, with a mean value of 0.46 kg.m(-2).s(-1), was significantly higher than that of grassland and woodland, with a mean value of 0.10 kg.m? 2.s(-1). The dominant factors affecting the SDC differed among different land uses. For cropland, the dominant factor was hydrodynamic parameters, while it was root and soil properties for orchards, grassland and woodland. The SDC variation with root length density (RLD) was greatly influenced by hydro-dynamic conditions in farmland. There was a clear zoning phenomenon for SDC variation with RLD in grassland and woodland. The critical conditions of different zones were also quantified. Different dominant factors affected the SDC within different zones: the dominant factor was roots when the RLD in root-soil composites was higher; the dominant factor was soil properties when there was lower RLD and better soil structure; and the dominant factor included both hydrodynamic parameters and roots under other conditions. Based on stream power, RLD, root mass density, clay content and organic matter, SDC prediction models suitable for different land uses were developed (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.92, Decision coefficient = 0.92). This study provides a scientific basis for analyzing the varying mechanisms of soil erosion involved in the land use transfer process.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				OCT	2022	224								105501	10.1016/j.still.2022.105501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2022.105501		AUG 2022											WOS:000861295300001

Meat from grazing yaks is considered very healthy; however, feedlot fattening, which includes concentrate, has been introduced. We questioned whether this change in management and diet would have an impact on the rumen and meat quality of yaks. This study examined the morphology, fermentation, and microbiota of the rumen and the quality of meat of three groups of bovines: (1) grazing yaks (GYs, 4-year olds), without dietary supplements; (2) yaks (FYs, 2.5-year olds) feedlot-fattened for 5 months after grazing natural pasture; and (3) feedlot-fattened cattle (FC, Simmental, 2-year olds). This design allowed us to determine the role of diet (with and without concentrate) and genotype (yaks vs. cattle) on variables measured. Ruminal papillae surface area was greater in the FYs than in the GYs (P = 0.02), and ruminal microbial diversity was greater but richness was lesser in the GYs than in the FC and FYs. Concentrations of ruminal volatile fatty acids were greater in the yaks than in the cattle. In addition, both yak groups had higher protein and lower fat contents in meat than the FC. Meat of GY had a lower n6:n3 ratio than FY and FC, and was the only group with a ratio below r, which is recommended for healthy food. Essential amino acids (EAA), as a proportion of total AA and of non-essential AA of yak meat, met WHO criteria for healthy food; whereas FC did not.

Correlation Studies among Nutritional Quality Parameters of Baby Corn	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC & INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH												Correlation studies made with nineteen diverse genotypes of baby corn (Zea mays L.) for seven nutritional quality parameters, viz., sugar, protein, potassium, ascorbic acid, phosphorus, iron and calcium contents revealed the positive association of protein content with ascorbic acid, sugar and calcium and negative with potassium and phosphorus. Ascorbic acid got a positive correlation with all the quality parameters under experiment except iron. Calcium showed a negative trend with sugar, phosphorous and potassium and positive with remaining parkuneters. Mae existed a positive and highly significant correlation between phosphorous and potassium. Iron content showed a positive correlation with potassium and calcium and negative with other parameters. This suggests that breeding for high protein content will lead to simultaneous improvement in ascorbic acid, sugar, and calcium. Similarly, selection for high iron content will simultaneously enhance potassium and calcium.

However, how the tandem working of H2S and rhizobia affects the adaptation of soybean to water deficiency is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the adaptation mechanism of H2S and rhizobia in soybean to water deficiency. Our results revealed that H2S and rhizobia jointly enhanced the leaf chlorophyll content and relative water content in plants, and caused an increase in the biomass of soybean seedlings under water deficiency. Besides, in the absence of water, H2S enhanced the biomass by affecting the number of nodules and nitrogenase activity during vegetative growth. The expression of nodulation marker genes including early nodulin 40 (GmENOD40), ERF required for nodulation (GmERN) and nodulation inception genes (GmNIN1a, GmNIN2a and GmNIN2b) were upregulated by H2S and rhizobia in the nodules. Moreover, the combined effect of H2S and rhizobia was proved to affect the enzyme activities and gene expression level of antioxidants, as well as osmotic protective substance content and related gene expression levels under water deficiency in soybean seedlings. In addition, the metabolomic results suggested that the combined effect of H2S and rhizobia remarkably promoted the contents of lipids and lipid-like molecules. Our results indicated that H2S and rhizobia synergistically reduced the oxidative damage caused by water deficiency through increasing the accumulation of metabolites and strengthening the plant antioxidant capacity.

We hypothesized here that Rn-GH in naturally ventilated greenhouses can be accurately predicted using global solar radiation in the vicinity of the greenhouse (Rs-out) as the only measured parameter, together with the calculated position of the sun, defined by the solar elevation angle and solar azimuth. To test this hypothesis, we performed experiments in two adjacent greenhouses in the Southern Negev, Israel (30.96 degrees N, 34.69 degrees E) under arid climate. In one of the greenhouses, tomato was grown during winter 2017-2018, while in the other, melon was grown during winter and spring 2018-2019. Our analyses demonstrated that Rn-GH can be accurately predicted (r2 = 0.982) using Rs-out as the only measured parameter, while the global solar radiation inside the greenhouse (Rs-GH), and the ratio between Rn-GH and Rs-GH are predominantly dependent on solar elevation angle and solar azimuth, as well as the greenhouse structure and cloud cover. This paper shows that the impact of these properties on the association between Rs-out and Rn-GH can be accurately resolved using multivariate regression by the k-nearest neighbors approach. This suggests that computerized modeling of the greenhouse structure and light transmission can potentially enable precise evaluation of Rn-GH and therefore also reference evapotranspiration in naturally ventilated greenhouses, using Rs-out as the only measured parameter. A calculation-based factor for the cloud effect on Rs-out transmittance into the greenhouse significantly improved the Rn-GH prediction under cloudy conditions.					ripert, marion/HHN-5115-2022														0378-3774	1873-2283				NOV 1	2021	257								107102	10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107102		AUG 2021											WOS:000703159300002

Many types of nanoparticles possess high antibacterial activity and thus are being investigated to combat environmental microbial contamination, limit bacterial deposition, and inhibit or destroy biofilms. In addition to finding nanoparticles with high and broad antibacterial activity, the synthesis of nanoparticles must also be sustainable and the nanoparticles should have low toxicity and low environmental impact. In this study, we developed a simple one-step probe sonication method to synthesize a ZnO nanoparticle functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO-ZnO) nanocomposite by exfoliating oxidized graphite in the presence of Zn2+. The antibacterial activity of the nanocomposite was higher than that of graphene oxide (GO) and rGO against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens) and Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis) bacteria. Direct intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Zn2+ leaching measurements indicated that the high antibacterial activity against different bacteria of the nanocomposite arises from the formation of ROS, whereas the effect of Zn2+ is negligible. Furthermore, incorporating rGO-ZnO nanocomposite into a polyethersulfone (PES) membrane inhibited biofilm growth compared with a pristine PES membrane. Leaching experiments of Zn2+ from the incorporated rGO-ZnO membrane during synthetic wastewater filtration revealed that Zn2+ concentration in the effluent was below the environmental standards for potable and non-potable uses. Our research presents an effective, fast, and low-cost preparation method for developing nanocomposites with high antimicrobial activities. Also, it shows that a nanocomposite incorporated polymeric membrane can be safely applied for water and wastewater treatment with minimum environmental impact.

Hence, the MPs abundance of soil aggregates and analyzed aggregates' stability, composition, and OC content from two soil layers of four land-use types in Gansu Province were investigated in this study. The total MPs abundances in woodland, farmland (wheat, maize, and potato), orchard, and intercropping (potato + apple orchard) of top and deep soils were 1383.3 and 1477.9, 1324.6 and 931.1, 1757.1 and 1930.9, 2127.2 and 1998.0, 1335.9 and 886.7, and 1777.5 and 1683.3 items kg(-1), respectively. The largest MPs abundance was detected in the >5 mm fractions of topsoil in potato (3077.3 items kg(-1)), followed by maize (3044.7 items kg(-1)) and intercropping (2718.4 items kg(-1)). In the topsoil, the total MPs abundance increased significantly with decreasing aggregate stability, and also was positively correlated with bulk density, microbial biomass, and total nitrogen contents of bulk soil. Summarizing, the abundance distribution of MPs correlates with the soil aggregate characteristics of the different land-use types.					haohao, li/HLG-9330-2023														0269-7491	1873-6424				OCT 1	2022	310								119880	10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119880	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119880		AUG 2022						35932900					WOS:000858937500006

We hypothesized that fertilizers affect soil microbial communities through soil properties and plant leaf C:N:P stoichiometry. To test this hypothesis in a sandy farmland ecosystem on the Mongolian Plateau, soil microbial diversity and composition, soil properties and plant leaf C:N:P stoichiometry were examined following 4 years of one of six fertilizer treatments (no fertilizer; returning straw; chemical fertilizer; manure; half quantity of chemical fertilizer and manure; and half quantity of chemical fertilizer). The soil bacterial Shannon index was lowest with chemical fertilizer and half quantity of chemical fertilizer, while fungal Chao richness and phylo-genetic diversity (PD) index were lowest with chemical fertilizer. However, chemical fertilizer combined with manure increased the soil bacterial Shannon and PD indices, while manure alone improved fungal Chao richness and the PD index. Fertilizers had a greater impact on the soil bacterial community than on the fungal community and the fungal community was more stable than the bacterial community. Based on redundancy analysis (RDA), total soil carbon, soil nitrogen, leaf carbon, leaf N:P, pH and 16S rRNA gene copy numbers affected the soil microbial community. Structural equation models (SEM) demonstrated that soil pH was a strong driving indi-cator of soil microbial community under fertilization in a sandy farmland ecosystem. Chemical fertilizer com-bined with manure out-performed other fertilizers in structuring soil bacterial communities, while chemical fertilizer alone was the worst in maintaining soil microbial communities. Results from this study provide a basis for fertilization management strategies in maintaining below-ground microbial diversity and in ensuring sus-tainable land development of sandy agroecosystems.

This study used leaf reflectance from a spectroradiometer to model grain yield (GY) and aboveground biomass yield (ABY) of maize (Zea mays L.) at Aba Gerima catchment, Ethiopia. A FieldSpec IV (350-2,500 nm wavelengths) spectroradiometer was used to estimate the spectral reflectance of crop leaves during the grain-filling phase. The spectral vegetation indices, such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference VI (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), soil adjusted VI, red NDVI, and simple ratio were deduced from the spectral reflectance. We used regression analyses to identify and predict GY and ABY at the catchment level. The coefficient of determination (R-2), the root mean square error (RMSE), and relative importance (RI) were used for evaluating model performance. The findings revealed that the best-fitting curve was obtained between GY and NDVI (R-2 = 0.70; RMSE = 0.065; P < 0.0001; RI = 0.19), followed by EVI (R-2 = 0.65; RMSE = 0.024; RI = 0.61; P < 0.0001). While the best-fitting curve was obtained between ABY and GNDVI (R-2 = 0.71; RI = 0.24; P < 0.0001), followed by NDVI (R-2 = 0.77; RI = 0.17; P < 0.0001). The highest GY (7.18 ton/ha) and ABY (18.71 ton/ha) of maize were recorded at a soil bunded plot on a gentle slope. Combined spectral indices were also employed to predict GY with R-2 (0.83) and RMSE (0.24) and ABY with R-2 (0.78) and RMSE (0.12). Thus, the maize's GY and ABY can be predicted with acceptable accuracy using spectral reflectance indices derived from spectroradiometer in an area like the Aba Gerima catchment. An estimation model of crop yields could help policy-makers in identifying yield-limiting factors and achieve decisive actions to get better crop yields and food security for Ethiopia.

However, the impact of land-use patterns (i.e., the spatial combinations of different land-use types) on soil C and N variations following revegetation remains unclear. In this study, we measured soil organic carbon (SOC), total carbon (TC), and total nitrogen (TN) stocks to a depth of 200 cm in grassland (GL), shrubland (SL), young forestland (YF), and mature forestland (MF) under four land-use patterns in a catchment located in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The highest SOC, TC and TN stocks occurred in MF and the lowest was found in GL. Compared to every single land-use type, soil C and N stocks significantly increased under different land-use patterns. The highest SOC stock (6.51 kg m(-2)) was found in the GL-YF-SL pattern, and the highest TC stock (47.25 kg m(-2)) and TN stock (0.70 kg m(-2)) were both observed in the MF-YF pattern. SOC stocks showed significantly positive correlations with TC and TN stocks under different land-use patterns (p < 0.05), except for the GL-MF. The soil C-N interactions were stronger in the MF-SL and GL-YF-SL patterns compared to the GL-MF and MF-SL. Redundancy analysis indicated that the SOC, TC, and TN variations were well explained by aboveground biomass and land-use patterns, with accumulated variance of 41.6% and 54.2% in Axis 1 and Axis 2, respectively. The differences of soil C and N accumulation among land-use patterns were mostly related to different vegetation coverage and the intensity of soil erosion. This study indicates that creating proper spatial distribution of land-use types on hillslopes could benefit soil C and N sequestrations and ecosystem restoration in semi-arid environments.

Evaluation of cultivation methods, surface, and deep soil water use of maize in a semi-arid environment in China	ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE												Whether continuous ridge-furrow plastic film mulch (PM) and flat planting with PM is sustainable for soil water status and yield remain unknown. The study investigated effects of ridge-furrow PM applied in spring (RFMS) or autumn (RFMA), flat planting with no mulch (CK), flat planting with 60% mulch in spring (M-S) or autumn (M-A) on soil water and maize yield from 2016 to 2019. High yields in RFMA resulted from high soil water storage (SWS) consumption in 0-220 cm soil layer during the growing season, with main water supply for early plant growth coming from 0 to 80 cm layer and can be recovered from rainfall during later in the growing season. From 80 to 220 cm, SWS declined during growing season but recovered during next fallow season. The 2016 growing season had the lowest precipitation, and RFMA and M-A had significantly more deep soil water consumption, which was replenished to normal levels in the following fallow season of 2016-2017. After four growing seasons, all PM treatments did not reduce deep soil water, compared to CK, or follow a declining trend over time, i.e., continuous cultivation with PM on Loess Plateau did not reduce soil water status.					wei, li/ISB-3361-2023; Chen, Yinglong/D-2104-2011; Siddique, Kadambot H.M./B-3462-2011	Chen, Yinglong/0000-0003-0798-8683; Siddique, Kadambot H.M./0000-0001-6097-4235													0365-0340	1476-3567				JAN 28	2022	68	2					226	241		10.1080/03650340.2020.1830070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2020.1830070		OCT 2020											WOS:000581156700001

Although investigating how mining activities such as open cut and/or underground mining change catchment baseflow is critical for understanding mining-related hydrological mechanisms and for helping water resource management, published data on these changes have not been well documented. This study uses data-driven approaches to examine how baseflow changes in four sets of paired catchments in the Hunter River Basin in Australia, which is one of the most intensive mining regions across the globe. The difference of cumulative anomaly percentage and double mass curves are used to detect the changes in baseflow and to identify the potential mining impacts. Our results show that underground mining has led to a decline in baseflow, while open cut mining has tended to increase baseflow, and significantly changed the baseflow trend for catchments where underground and open cut mining coexist. The mining impact signal, however, is on the top of regional climate change impacts that dominate baseflow annual variability. The data-driven investigation cannot separate impacts due to multiple and overlapping disturbances of mining activities but provides insight and guidance for hydrological modeling to simulate mining impacts on hydrological regimes.

The use of alternative practices is a way to reduce soil erosion. Our objectives were to assess the long-term impacts of different soil tillage systems on soil physical and hydraulic characteristics, emphasizing management practices to improve the soil physical qualities (reduce bulk density and increase stability of aggregate) under the conservation tillage system in the Loess Plateau of China. Conventional tillage (CT), no tillage (NT), and sub-soiling (SS) were applied in this experiment. Soil wet aggregates distribution and stability, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, soil water retention curves and pore size distributions were measured. The results showed that in the 010 cm and 1020 cm depth soil layers, NT and SS treatments showed a significantly higher proportion of wet aggregates>250 mu m (macroaggregates) compared to CT. In these two layers, the proportion of wet aggregates<53 mu m (microaggregates) was significantly higher in CT with respect to NT and SS. SOC content increased as the aggregate fraction size increased, and was higher within wet aggregates>250 mu m than within the 25053 mu m and < 53 mu m(silt+clay) fractions at both depths. In addition, the conservation tillage (NT and SS) can result in improved total porosity and reduced soil bulk density compared with CT in the surface layer. Pore size distribution in CT soil was unimodal, with the maximum in the 1030 mu m matrix pores of the surface layer. However, in the surface layer the pore size distributions from NT and SS showed a dual porosity curve, with two peaks in the matrix and structural pore areas. The 1020 cm layer showed similar pore size distributions in each treatment. After scanning the soils by micro-computed tomography, we visualized the pore characteristics. The images showed that CT reduced the long and connected macropores compared with conservation tillage. Overall, soil aggregate stability and soil macropores are most improved under conservation tillage. Conservation tillage with crop residues should be adopted instead of conventional tillage, as an effort to improve crop yield and control soil erosion in the Loess Plateau of China.

Despite recent advances in understanding organic carbon deposition in aquatic ecosystems, the burial of organic carbon in dry depositional environments remains unclear. Here, combining large-scale field surveys and remote sensing techniques, we provide a robust estimate for sediment retention and organic carbon burial of check dams on the Chinese Loess Plateau. We find that the 50,226 active check dams have intercepted 10.2 +/- 0.6 Pg eroded sediment during 1970-2020, which equals to 46% of the sediment load of Yellow River. Based on 86 deep sediment cores, we estimate that 21.6 +/- 9.9 Tg of organic carbon was buried over the past 50 years by check dams with a burial rate of 468 +/- 204 g C m(-2) yr(-1), approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of global lakes/reservoirs. We also find that the organic carbon burial efficiency of check dams (similar to 80%) is significantly higher than in other depositional environments. We argue that organic carbon burial by check dams represents a significant terrestrial carbon sink and must be accounted for in global carbon budget.

This study investigated the effects of soil bunds on the monthly and diurnal dynamics of soil respiration rates in the highlands of the Upper Blue Nile basin in Ethiopia. Six plots (with and without soil bunds, three replicates) were used for measurement of seasonal soil respiration, and 18 plots were used for measurement of diurnal soil respiration. We collected seasonal variation data on a monthly basis from September 2020 to August 2021. Diurnal soil respiration data were collected four times daily (5 a.m., 11 a.m., 5 p.m., and 11 p.m.) for 2 weeks from 16 to 29 September 2021. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that seasonal soil respiration rates differed significantly (p < 0.05) between soil bund and control plots in all seasons. In plots with soil bunds, seasonal soil respiration rates were lowest in February (1.89 +/- 0.3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), mean +/- SE) and highest in October (14.54 +/- 0.5 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). The diurnal soil respiration rate was significantly (p < 0.05) higher at 11 a.m. than at other times, and was lowest at 5 a.m. Seasonal variation in soil respiration was influenced by soil temperature negatively and moisture positively. Diurnal soil respiration was significantly affected by soil temperature but not by soil moisture. Further study is required to explore how differences in soil microorganisms between different land management practices affect soil respiration rates.

The yak is a unique animal on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, and plays important roles in local livelihoods and ecology. Because of the harsh climate conditions, early weaned yak calves often face environmental and nutritional stress. The herbal active ingredients of some herbs improve the antioxidant capacity and immunity of animals. In the current study, early-weaned yak calves were supplemented with three widely used Chinese traditional herbal root extracts to examine whether they can improve the immune response and antioxidant capacity. The results demonstrated that the supplementary herbs increased the serum antioxidant capacity, and improved the energy and nitrogen metabolism of the yak calves. Chinese traditional herbs are used widely as feed supplements to improve the immune response and antioxidant capacity of livestock. Twenty early-weaned 4-month-old yak calves (72.3 +/- 3.65 kg) were divided randomly into four groups (n = 5 per group); three groups were provided with supplementary 80 mL/kg DMI of the root water extracts of either Angelica sinensis, Codonopsis pilosula or Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and one group (control) was not provided with a supplement. Compared to control calves, calves consuming the three herbal extracts increased serum concentrations of albumin (ALB) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), but decreased serum concentrations of free fatty acids (FFAs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (p < 0.05). Calves consuming A. sinensis decreased (p < 0.05) serum concentration of total cholesterol (TC), and increased (p < 0.05) serum concentration of total proteins (TP). Serum FFA concentrations increased (p = 0.004) linearly with time in the control group, but not in the groups consuming herbs. Serum metabolomic data demonstrated that A. sinensis and C. pilosula regulate mainly amino acid metabolism, while G. uralensis regulates mainly carbon and amino acid metabolism. It was concluded that the three herbal root extracts, as dietary supplements, improved energy and nitrogen metabolism, and enhanced the antioxidant capacity of yak calves.

Soil aggregation can help protect soil organic matter from biodegradation; it affects soil physical (aeration), chemical (water infiltration), and biological (microbial) activities. The integrated plant nutrition system (IPNS) and organic farming (OF) options have been contemplated as a sustainable strategy to sustain soil aggregate stability under adverse climatic conditions and a possible tool to restore degraded soil systems. Results suggested that the application of plant nutrients based on IPNS and soil test crop response (STCR) including mineral fertilizers and organic manure (farmyard manure: FYM) improved soil aggregate stability and mean weight diameter (MWD) under rice-wheat cropping systems. A long-term (19 year) cropping system (rice-wheat) experiment was examined to identify best nutrient management practices. Seven nutrient supply options were applied: organic, mineral fertilizer in combination with IPNS, IPNS + B/IPNS + C to improve soil aggregate stability and MWD after completing 19 cropping cycles of rice-wheat cropping systems. Results showed that significantly higher (+31%) macroaggregates were dominant in the surface soil layer than in the subsurface soil. The significantly highest macroaggregates were observed under OF (60.12 g 100 g(-1) dry soil) management practices followed by IPNS options. The MWD was significantly increased (+17%) between surface and subsurface soil. Maximum MWD was reported with OF (0.93 mm) management practices followed by the IPNS + C (0.78 mm), IPNS + B (0.77 mm), IPNS (0.70 mm), STCR (0.69 mm), NPK (0.67 mm), and unfertilized control (0.66 mm) plots. Overall, results suggest that the adoption of IPNS options, such as organic farming (OF), RDF, STCR, and inclusion of pulses (berseem and cowpea), significantly improved all soil aggregation fractions in the soil system and also offered an additional benefit in terms of soil sustainability.

Converting multi-trait breeding objectives into operative selection indexes to ensure genetic gains in low-input sheep and goat breeding programmes	ANIMAL												Small ruminant breeding programmes in low-input production systems are best organised at the community level. Participant farmers have to agree on goal traits and their relative importance. When BLUP breeding values of goal traits are not available in time, appropriate selection indexes can be used to aid visual selection. Taking Ethiopian Abergelle goat and Bonga sheep community-based breeding programmes (CBBPs) as an example, breeding objective functions were defined and selection indexes were constructed and evaluated. Breeding goals for Abergelle goats included early sale weight, survival and milk production. Breeding goals for Bonga included the number of offspring born, sale weight and survival. Economic weights of objective traits can be used in several ways depending on measured traits and the reliability of their genetic parameters. Selection indexes included combinations of objective traits measured on candidates and their dams and situations when Abergelle communities prefer to restrict genetic changes in number of offspring born or adult weight and when Bonga communities prefer to restrict changes in adult weight. Genetic and economic gains were evaluated as well as sensitivity to feed cost assumptions and to repeated dam records. After independent culling on preponderant traits such as coat colour and horn/tail type, sires in Abergelle goat community breeding programmes should be selected on indexes including at least own early live weight and their dams average milk production records. Sires for Bonga sheep programmes should be selected on own early live weight and desirably also on their dam's number of offspring born. Sensitivity to feed cost assumptions was negligible but repeated measurements of dam records improved index accuracies considerably. Restricting genetic changes in number of offspring born or adult weight is not recommended. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of The Animal Consortium.

Understanding the effectiveness of distinct re-vegetation types under different physiographic conditions (slope gradient, percentage of vegetation cover and rainfall depth) is essential for better policy formulation. This study examines the benefits of soil erosion control in forests and grasslands using published data. This analysis proves that the benefits of vegetation restoration increase with increasing the vegetation cover and tend to be stable when the coverage exceeds 60%. The benefits on sediment yield reduction are more sensitive (vs. runoff reduction benefit) to rainfall intensity. Regarding slopes and soil erosion control, the highest efficiencies appear in forests on 20-25 degrees slopes and in grasslands on 15-20 degrees slopes. Grasslands can effectively reduce soil erosion, as well as forests with understory grasses. For long-term restoration, a 60% vegetation cover maximizes the benefits of reducing soil erosion and maintaining enough soil water supply that prevents possible soil drought. We propose that future afforestation policies should evaluate in advance the appropriate re-vegetation type; meanwhile, suitable vegetation coverage and local physiographic conditions should be considered. Importantly, promotion of grassland and preservation of forest understory grasses must be enforced in land use policies when considering afforestation to minimize soil erosion. We suggest further research to quantify the efficiency of understory vegetation on soil erosion control, which might provide scientific and practical guidance for afforestation policy in semi-arid areas.

Response of soil water, temperature, and maize productivity to different irrigation practices in an arid region	SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH												Irrigation combined with plastic film mulch (IPFM) is widely used in arid areas to alleviate water shortages and increase crop yields. However, the mechanisms by which IPFM affected soil water content (SWC) and soil temperature (ST) to promote crop photosynthesis and resources (water, nitrogen and radiation) utilization are unclear. A field experiment was conducted in northwestern China in 2019 and 2020 to evaluate the effects of different irrigation methods combined with transparent film mulching (70% cover) on soil hydrothermal conditions and maize growth, photosynthetic characteristics, yield, and resource use efficiency. The four treatments included border irrigation with no mulching (CK), border irrigation under film mulching (TM), ridge irrigation under film mulching (RM), and drip irrigation under film mulching (DM). Our results showed that TM and RM significantly improved SWC, enhanced photosynthetic rate (Pn), and lowered non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) in maize relative to CK. The DM treatment had wetter soil and lower soil surface temperatures from the V12 to R3 stage, further accelerating maize photosynthesis and resource use relative to the other treatments and thus producing the higher leaf area index and biomass accumulation. The results suggest that DM is an efficient farming strategy, increasing yield by 3.7 - 61.3%, radiation use efficiency for maize grain yield (RUEGY) by 2.8-44.3%, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) by 29.7-96.5%, partial factor productivity of nitrogen (PFPN) by 3.7-61.3%, and economic benefit by 12.4-100.0% relative to the other treatments. In addition, the regression function revealed that the increased soil water storage and decreased ST from VT to R3 stages helped increase maize yield. Thus, we recommended DM practice for increasing maize production in arid areas and proposed soil water storage in 0-120 cm profile ranging 342-389 mm and ST ranging from 18.9 degrees to 22.1 degrees C as reference management indicators.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				MAR	2024	237								105962	10.1016/j.still.2023.105962	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2023.105962		NOV 2023											WOS:001128139600001

This research aims to find high -yield-ing and stable chickpea genotypes to rainfed condition. Fourteen advanced chickpea genotypes with two control cultivars were cultivated in a randomized complete block design in four regions of Iran during 2017-2020 growing sea-sons. The first two principal components of AMMI explained 84.6 and 10.0 % of genotype by environment interactions, respectively. Superior genotypes based on simultaneous selection index of ASV (ssiASV), ssiZA, ssiDi and ssiWAAS were G14, G5, G9 and G10; those based on ssiEV and ssiSIPC were G14, G5, G10 and G15 and those based on ssiMASD were G14, G5, G10 and G15. The AMMI1 biplot identified G5, G12, G10 and G9 as stable and high-yielding genotypes. Geno-types G6, G5, G10, G15, G14, G9 and G3 were the most stable genotypes in the AMMI2 biplot. Based on the harmonic mean and relative performance of genotypic values, G11, G14, G9 and G13 were the top four superior genotypes. Factorial regression indicated that rainfall is very important at the beginning and end of the growing seasons. Geno-type G14, in many environments and all analytical and experimental approaches, has good performance and stability. Partial least squares regression identified genotype G5 as a suitable genotype for moisture and temperature stresses conditions. Therefore, G14 and G5 could be candidates for introduction of new cultivars.																			2500-0462	2500-3259					2023	27	2					135	145		10.18699/VJGB-23-19	http://dx.doi.org/10.18699/VJGB-23-19								37303937					WOS:000976318500006
J	Wang, ZS; Li, Z; Jia, SM				Wang, Zhengshi; Li, Zhi; Jia, Shuming			The transformation between different modes of motion of particles in steady aeolian transport	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Aeolian sediment transport is an important morphodynamic process that drives geomorphological evolution, affects the climate system, and induces various natural disasters. The creep load involves both particles of a sufficiently large size that cannot be easily lifted to the upper air, as well as smaller particles that can transition between different modes of motion, although the contribution of the latter has rarely been investigated. In this study, we investigate the features of the saltation cycle, namely the time period from the moment a particle is entrained into the air to when the particle is again trapped in the bed, and the transformation mechanism be-tween creep, reptation, and saltation by directly simulating the steady-state sand transport of particles within the saltation regime. The results indicate that a saltation cycle generally contains one to tens of individual hop processes, with the mean and standard deviation of the hop times decreasing with the increasing friction velocity, owing to the presence of more energetic particles at the bed surface. Over half of the transported particles move in creep or reptation model because a moving particle generally experiences frequent transition between creep, reptation, and saltation. Furthermore, the fundamental reason for the change in the mode of motion is the strong impact velocity dependence of the total coefficient of restitution during the rebound process. Current rebound models predict a reasonable coefficient of restitution only if the particle impacts the bed at a moderate velocity; however, their predictions deviate from the actual situation at relatively low or high impact velocities. These findings enhance our understanding of the motion dynamics of particles within wind-blown sand movements, and further reduce the uncertainty in predicting their mass flux in different modes of motion.																			0169-555X	1872-695X				NOV 1	2023	440								108892	10.1016/j.geomorph.2023.108892	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2023.108892		SEP 2023											WOS:001070702800001

In this study, we aimed to fill this gap by assessing the effect of seven-year grazing exclusion on vegetation and soil seed bank along an altitudinal gradient in northern Tibet, China. Species richness, Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's diversity index of vegetation and soil seed bank, seed density, and the Sorensen index all displayed a mid-domain (hump-shaped) pattern with increasing altitude, except for the Shannon-Wiener and Pielou indices of soil seed bank in fenced grasslands. These results demonstrated that the impact of grazing exclusion on the patterns of vegetation and soil seed bank change with altitude but are not synchronous. Grazing exclusion increased vegetation coverage but decreased soil seed bank density, and species diversity of vegetation and soil seed bank. The Sorensen index (0.03-0.2) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis indicated that the species composition differed between vegetation and soil seed bank, but no difference was found between fenced and grazed grasslands. The low similarity suggests that the soil seed bank contributes little to vegetation recovery in alpine grassland. Seven-year grazing exclusion had no effect on either vegetation succession or species composition of soil seed bank in alpine grassland. Overall, our findings suggest reconsidering the use of long-term grazing exclusion to restore degraded grassland at high altitudes (above 4400 m above sea level) on the Tibetan Plateau.

Labile organic N pools are crucial for N mineralization but are less investigated because of their fast dynamics. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of winter wheat straw N (N-15-labelled) on soil labile organic N transformations under long-term (27 years) no-tillage and conventional tillage. Four treatments were established under controlled conditions: no-tillage without straw (NoTill); no-tillage with N-15-labelled wheat straw (NoTill+Straw); conventional tillage without straw (ConvTill); and conventional tillage with N-15-labelled straw (ConvTill +Straw). Straw application increased the particulate organic matter N (POMN) and microbial biomass N (MBN) contents, especially in NoTill +Straw, but decreased the dissolved organic N (DON) content. This reflects intensive microbial DON immobilization at the background of plant residues with a high C/N ratio. The 40% to 80% increase in the NH4+ content after straw addition reflects fast straw and soil organic matter (SOM) mineralization, while NO3- declined by 60% to 93% over 56 days, especially in ConvTill soil. N-15 recovered in POMN after 14 d was greatest in NoTill +Straw and ConvTill +Straw, reaching 20 and 18 mg N-15 kg(-1), respectively. Overall, the straw N recovered as NO3- was 72% and 48% greater than that in NH4+ in ConvTill +Straw and NoTill +Straw, respectively, reflecting ac-celerated SOM mineralization and N mining in the presence of straw. The straw N recovered as POMN was greater through the incubation period (56 days) than that in DON and MBN, especially in NoTill +Straw, indicat-ing that the no-tillage practice reduced straw mineralization. N-15 in DON and N-15 in NO3- were higher in NoTill +Straw than in ConvTill+Straw, implying that N limitation was alleviated to a certain extent under no-tillage conditions. In conclusion, wheat straw N remained mainly in POMN after 56 days, especially under no-till condi-tions. and only a minor part was incorporated into DON and microbial biomass. This provides a theoretical basis for straw N use efficiency in agroecosystems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In particular, the response of alpine grasslands in the TRHR to changing climate and ecological compensations is still poorly understood. Here, we present data on vegetation trends of the TRHR from 1982 to 2015 by employing multiple high-resolution satellite data to determine the mean annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In addition, spatio-temporal changes in climate were monitored by long-term climate data collection and by using the distributed modeling system. It emerged that: 1) there was a weak increasing trend, albeit not significant, in overall TRHR NDVI, ranging between 0.23 and 0.27; whereas, grassland NDVI ranged between 0.43 and 0.50, and displayed a significant (r(adj)(2) = 0.46; P - 0.004) linear increase with year; 2) annual average temperature was below 0 degrees C and increased linearly (r(adj)(2) = 0.60; P - 0.01) at a rate of 0.06 degrees Clyr from 2000 to 2015, which was almost four times faster than the rate of global warming; and 3) average rainfall was 493 mm/yr, with no significant yearly trend. In conclusion, climate warming enhanced vegetation growth and recovery in the TRHR since 2000; whereas, rainfall did not show a trend. However, vegetation changes on the spatial scale demonstrated zoning and segmentation effects. Consequently, for restoration of degraded lands in the TRHR, effective one-to-one ecological conservation projects, which are particular to an eco-fragile area, should be implemented. In addition, these results are important for regional planning of livestock stocking rates and animal husbandry systems, which can have great impact on the livelihood of the people in the area.

However, the changes in deep (>100 cm depth) SOC stock following land-use conversion have not been fully elucidated. In this study, to determine the changes in deep SOC stock (to a depth of 400 cm) resulting from conversion of cropland to woodland, shrubland and grassland on the Chinese Loess Plateau, 469 observations from peer-reviewed publications and original measured data were synthesised. The results were as follows: (a) SOC stock increased significantly at 0-100 and 100-200 cm layers regardless of land-use conversion types. (b) Carbon loss occurred in the 200-400 cm layers due to land-use conversion. (c) Changes in SOC stock varied with restoration age, except for conversion of cropland to grassland. Specifically, SOC stock increased with restoration age in the upper 200 cm layers, whereas that in the 200-400 cm layers first increased and then decreased in the middle to later stages under conversion to woodland and shrubland. (d) Initial SOC stock and rainfall zones had significant effects on the changes of deep SOC stock. (e) Furthermore, an accumulation of 1 Mg ha(-1)in the upper 100 cm was associated with an approximately 0.45 Mg ha(-1)increase in the 100-400 cm soil layers. These results indicate that land-use conversion, particularly conversion of cropland to woodland, changes deep (>100 cm) SOC stock, and restoration age should be taken into consideration when assessing deep carbon sequestration.

However, the characteristics of the spatiotemporal EP responsible for such hazardous situations remain poorly understood. We integrate universal multifractals with a segmentation algorithm to characterize a physically meaningful threshold for EP (EPT). Using daily data from 1961 to 2015, we investigate the spatiotemporal variation of EP over the LP. Our results indicate that (with precipitation increasing) EPTs range from 17.3 to 50.3 mm d(-1), while the mean annual EP increases from 35 to 138 mm from the northwestern to the southeastern LP. Further, historically, the EP frequency (EPF) has spatially varied from 54 to 116 d, with the highest EPF occurring in the mid-southern and southeastern LP where precipitation is much more abundant. However, EP intensities tend to be strongest in the central LP, where precipitation also tends to be scarce, and get progressively weaker as we move towards the margins (similarly to EP severity). An examination of atmospheric circulation patterns indicates that the central LP is the inland boundary with respect to the reach and impact of tropical cyclones in China, resulting in the highest EP intensities and EP severities being observed in this area. Under the control of the East Asian monsoon, precipitation from June to September accounts for 72% of the total amount, and 91% of the total EP events are concentrated between June and August. Further, EP events occur, on average, 11 d earlier than the wettest part of the season. These phenomena are responsible for the most serious natural hazards in the LP, especially in the central LP region. Spatiotemporally, 91.4% of the LP has experienced a downward trend in precipitation, whereas 62.1% of the area has experienced upward trends in the EP indices, indicating the potential risk of more serious hazardous situations. The universal multifractal approach considers the physical processes and probability distribution of precipitation, thereby providing a formal framework for spatiotemporal EP assessment at the regional scale.

The accurate measurement of rill flow velocity when impacted by the thawing process is critical to simulate runoff and sediment transport processes. In this study, an electrolyte tracer modelling method was used to measure rill flow velocity along a meadow soil slope at different thaw depths under simulated rainfall. Rill flow velocity was measured using four thawed soil depths (0, 1, 2 and 10 cm), four slope gradients (5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees and 20 degrees) and four rainfall intensities (30, 60, 90 and 120 mm center dot h(-1)). The results showed that the increase in thawed soil depth caused a decrease in rill flow velocity, whereby the rate of this decrease was also diminishing. Whilst the rill flow velocity was positively correlated with slope gradient and rainfall intensity, the response of rill flow velocity to these influencing factors varied with thawed soil depth. The mechanism by which thawed soil depth influenced rill flow velocity was attributed to the consumption of runoff energy, slope surface roughness, and the headcut effect. Rill flow velocity was modelled by thawed soil depth, slope gradient and rainfall intensity using an empirical function. This function predicted values that were in good agreement with the measured data. These results provide the foundation for a better understanding of the effect of thawed soil depth on slope hydrology, erosion and the parameterization scheme for hydrological and soil erosion models.

The release of bulk biochar into biochar nanoparticles (NPs) may bring risks because of their potential flowing into downstream water bodies with nutrients/containments attached. Low-temperature pyrolyzed biochars, namely fruit tree branch biochar of 350/450/550 degrees C (FB350, FB450 and FB550), corn straw biochar of 350 degrees C (CB350) and peanut straw biochar of 350 degrees C (PB350), were produced, and their NPs were extracted. The yield, elemental composition, mineral composition, surface functional groups and zeta potential of biochar NPs were characterized. Subsequently their suspension stability was evaluated in NaCl and CaCl2 solutions by dynamic light scattering technique. The Hamaker constants and particle interaction energy of the biochar NPs were calculated by adopting Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory. For biochar NPs of same feedstock, the stability of FB350/450/550-NPs could be predicted well by their zeta potential values. The types of their surface functional groups were the same while their adsorption intensity differed. The scenarios for biochar NPs of different feedstock sources were different, that is, inconsistent variation was observed between their zeta potential and suspension stability, which were rooted in the variable type and quantity of surface functional groups. In conclusion, feedstock was the most significant factor that influenced the suspension stability of biochar NPs, followed by the pyrolysis temperature and solution chemistry, which were highly dependent on surface potential. The findings provide references for the environmental risk evaluation of biochar NPs and reasonable application of biochar in field. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Multi-environment yield trials of twenty durum wheat genotypes were conducted at five locations of Iran (Gachsaran, Gonbad, Moghan, Ilam and Khorram abad) over four years (2009-2013). Combined ANOVA of yield data of the twenty environments (year/location combined) revealed highly significant differences among genotypes and environments as well as significant genotype-environment interaction indicated differential performance of genotypes over test environments. The GE interaction was examined using multivariate analysis technique as principal coordinate analysis (PCOA). According to grand means and total mean yield, test environments were grouped into two main groups as high mean yield (H) and low mean yield (L). There were eleven H test environments and nine L test environments which analyzed in the sequential cycles. For each cycle, both scatter point diagram and minimum spanning tree plot were drawn. The identified most stable genotypes with dynamic stability concept and based on the minimum spanning tree plots and centroid distances were G12 (3342 kg ha(-1)), G10 (3470.3 kg ha(-1)), G5 (3203.0 kg ha(-1)), and G1 (3263.5 kg ha(-1)), and therefore could be recommended for unfavorable or poor conditions. Genotypes G10 (3470.3 kg ha(-1)) and G9 (3404.2 kg ha(-1)) were located several times in the vertex positions of high cycles according to the principal coordinates analysis (PCOA) and therefore could be recommended for favorable or rich conditions. Finally, the results of principal coordinates analysis in general confirmed the breeding value of the genotypes, obtained on the basis of the yield stability evaluation.

Little or no evidence is available for the comparative performance of existing agronomic practices of teff. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of different tillage, sowing, and soil compaction practices on productivity and economic attributes of teff. The study was conducted in the 2018 and 2019, in the highland agro-ecological zone of the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia. Treatments included combinations of two tillage practices (reduced and conventional), two sowing methods (row and broadcast), and two compaction options (with and without trampling). Tillage practice did not significantly influence grain yield in either year, but broadcast sowing gave higher grain and straw yields than row sowing in both years. Trampling gave higher grain and straw yields than no trampling. Reduced tillage, row sowing, and no trampling resulted in a significantly higher weed density than the corresponding farmer practices of conventional tillage, broadcast sowing, and trampling. Tillage and trampling methods did not significantly affect lodging, but lodging was significantly lower in row sowing than in broadcast sowing. The partial-budget analysis showed that most treatments incorporating conventional tillage were generally less profitable, as they gave less net benefit and more total variable cost. Therefore, reduced tillage + broadcast sowing-trampling, reduced tillage + broadcast sowing + trampling, reduced tillage + row sowing + trampling, and reduced tillage + row sowing-trampling were profitable, with net benefit values of 5983, 5367, 4913, and 4361 USD ha-1, respectively. The trampling was less important as it requires more labor or draft power. Therefore, we recommend the combined use of reduced tillage + row sowing without trampling as the best management practices for teff production. Row sowing is more appropriate for easy farm operation in mechanized teff production and farmers with adequate family labor. We conclude that reduced tillage and row sowing without trampling are promising practices to achieve reasonable yields at minimum cost, provided they are integrated with appropriate weed control.

J	Wu, L; Yen, H; Ma, XY				Wu, Lei; Yen, Haw; Ma, Xiaoyi			Effects of particulate fractions on critical slope and critical rainfall intensity for runoff phosphorus from bare loessial soil	CATENA												Slope and rainfall intensity are important factors affecting runoff phosphorus (P), but the dynamic mechanism of their coupled influence on P fractions in loessial bare sloping lands is not completely understood. The critical slope and critical rainfall intensity are thresholds associated with significant changes in runoff, erosion, and/or nutrient loss. In this study, 30 rainfall events (45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 mm/h; 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees) were simulated to estimate the contribution of particulate P (PP) and soluble P (SP) fractions to P loss from bare loessial soils and identify the critical slope and critical rainfall intensity for different P forms and TP fluxes. The results indicate that: (i) total phosphorus (TP) and PP loss concentrations are significantly correlated to sediment yield and slope gradient, although there were close relationships between the average TP loss concentration and rainfall intensity at slopes of 20 degrees and 25 degrees; (ii) P in runoff from bare loessial soil consists almost entirely of the reactive PP form (96.6%), regardless of rainfall intensity and slope. The average PP fraction for different rainfall intensities increases with increasing slope, from 94.6% at a 5 degrees slope to 98.0% at a 25 degrees slope; and (iii) PP and TP have the same critical slope and critical rainfall intensity for bare loessial soil because of the dominance of PP in runoff P. The critical slope for the sharp increases in PP and TP was found to be in the range of 15-20 degrees because the average losses at 20-25 degrees increased about 1.67 times compared to 5-15 degrees, and the critical rainfall intensity for significant increases in PP and TP was found to be in the range of 90-105 mm/h. The hydrological pathways transporting the various P fractions under storms may help to provide new insights needed to guide sloping farmland management in rainfed land agroecosystems of loess hilly regions.

For mixed life-form biomes such as savannas, plant function is very difficult to parameterise due to the distinct physiological characteristics of tree and grass plant functional types (PFTs) that vary dramatically across space and time. The partitioning of their fractional contributions to ecosystem gross primary production (GPP) remains to be achieved at regional scale using remote sensing. The objective of this study was to partition savanna gross primary production (GPP) into tree and grass functional components based on their distinctive phenological characteristics. Comparison of the remote sensing partitioned GPP(tree) and GPP(grass) against field measurements from eddy covariance (EC) towers showed an overall good agreement in terms of both GPP seasonality and magnitude. We found total GPP, as well as its tree and grass components, decreased dramatically with rainfall over the North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT), from the Eucalyptus forest and woodland in the northern humid coast to the grasslands, Acacia woodlands and shrublands in the southern xeric interior. Spatially, GPP(tree) showed a steeper decrease with precipitation along the NATT compared to GPP(grass), thus tree/grass GPP ratios also decreased from the northern mesic region to the arid south region of the NATT. However, results also showed a second trend at the southern part of the transect, where tree-grass ratios and total GPP increased with decreasing mean annual precipitation, and this occurred in the physiognomic transition from hummock grasslands to Acacia woodland savannas. Total GPP and tree-grass GPP ratios across climate extremes were found to be primarily driven by grass layer response to rainfall dynamics. The grass-containing xeric savannas exhibited a higher hydroclimatic sensitivity, whereas GPP in the northern mesic savannas was fairly stable across years despite large variations in rainfall amount. The pronounced spatiotemporal variations in savanna vegetation productivity encountered along the NATT study area suggests that the savanna biome is particularly sensitive and vulnerable to predicted future climate change and hydroclimatic variability.

Photoluminescence kinetics for monitoring photoinduced processes in perovskite solar cells	SOLAR ENERGY												The research on halide perovskites is in its peak activity at the moment due to the materials potential application in photovoltaics. It is well known that slow processes, from seconds to minutes, are very significant in perovskite films and devices as compared to conventional photovoltaic materials. The kinetics of photoluminescence (PL) is informative data for studying such processes. In particular, tracing the change in PL intensity under continuous laser excitation provides information on charge carriers recombination and the efficiency of their extraction from the absorber layer. Although widely available, this method was applied mainly for the research on thin films. However, monitoring PL kinetics on complete solar cells as well as on incomplete device stacks at each fabrication and lifespan stage can provide an important information on the device optimization and determination of the layers and interfaces that limit device efficiency and stability. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of the method by tracing the evolution of PL kinetics at seconds-to-minutes timescale upon: (1) varying perovskite composition (MAPbI(3), Cs(0.15)FA(0.85)PbI(2.7)Br(0.3), Cs-0.05(MA(0.15)FA(0.85))(0.95)PbI2.55Br0.45); (2) layer-by-layer stack construction of Cs(0.15)FA(0.85)PbI(2.7)Br(0.3)-based solar cell and (3) the device on-shelf degradation. In this way, information on charge carrier recombination, diffusion and extraction is revealed purely by optical, contactless and non-destructive means.

However, variation in soil properties and its influence on the dynamic change of soil erosion resistance to overland flow in the WLFZ of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) still unclear and need to be further quantified. Therefore, soil samples from different elevations were collected along a slope profile at different times in the WLFZ of the TGR, then the soil properties and plant biomass were measured and the soil detachment capacity (Dc) were estimated by conducting a scouring experiment. Then the K-r and 'r(c) were obtained according to the linear relationship between D-c and shear stress. The results indicated that most measured soil properties suffered low variability but organic matter content showed the moderate variability. K-r varied from 0.10 to 0.17 s m(-1) and 'r(c) varied in the range of 1.56-2.24 Pa for all sampling points, and both showed spatial and temporal variations. K-r decreased with increasing elevation until reaching a minimum value and then increased spatially, while it showed a decreasing trend or a decreasing trend followed by an increasing trend over time for different elevation segments temporally. tic increased with increasing elevation spatially and increased or showed an increase followed by a decrease over time for different elevation segments temporally.

Study focus: Stable isotopes of water (Oxygen-18 and Deuterium) were used as tracers to estimate the contribution of groundwater in shallow hillslope aquifers to streamflow in the Robit-Bata watershed. To assess the spatiotemporal variability of shallow groundwater and develop a hydrograph separation technique, we collected rainfall, shallow groundwater, and streamflow samples and analyzed their delta O-18 and delta(2H) isotopic compositions. The local meteoric water line (LMWL) and local evaporative line (LEL) of the study area were determined and compared with the global meteoric water line (GMWL). A standard unweighted two-component isotope-based hydrograph separation model was used to determine the percentage contribution of shallow groundwater to streamflow. New hydrological insights for the region: The LMWL (delta H-2 = 8.63.delta O-18 + 18.2) mostly showed heavy isotopic enrichment relative to GMWL, and the LEL (delta H-2 = 5.45.delta O-18 + 6.96) indicated isotopic enrichment compared to Ethiopian lakes. Shallow groundwater responded rapidly to rainfall, with good spatial correlation depending on topographic positions of wells. Pre-event water contributed <50% to peak discharge in July, but >90% when the watershed reached maximum storage. This finding gives insight towards the predominant runoff generation process and has significant implications for sustainable dry season irrigation expansion in the area as the subsurface flow drains out of the watershed from October onwards reducing water tables in the shallow wells.

In this study, multiple experimentally simulated rainfalls were applied on a flat and smooth flume with variable slopes. To identify the RDI effect, one half of the data was collected with the flume covered by a gauze screen near runoff surface. Comparisons of results indicated that RDI increased the flow resistance, reduced flow velocity and increased flow depth. Darcy-Weisbach resistance and Manning coefficient decreased in the slope range 2-12%, and kept almost constant in higher slope range. Corresponding approximately to 12% slope, Reynolds number, Re = 800 appears to be a critical value separating the laminar and turbulent flow regime under rainfall conditions. Empirical equations relating Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient and Manning coefficient to Reynolds number and rainfall intensity were obtained. In addition, empirical equations of the incremental resistance, due to RDI were established for laminar flows. This study revealed some aspects of RDI in the rainfall-runoff hydrologic processes.

The efficient, the intensive, and the productive: Insights from urban Kaya scaling	APPLIED ENERGY												Urban areas play an unprecedented role in potentially mitigating climate change and supporting sustainable development. In light of the rapid urbanisation in many parts on the globe, it is crucial to understand the relationship between settlement size and CO2 emission efficiency of cities. Recent literature on urban scaling properties of emissions as a function of population size has led to contradictory results and more importantly, lacked an in-depth investigation of the essential factors and causes explaining such scaling properties. Therefore, in analogy to the well-established Kaya Identity, we develop a relation combining the involved exponents. We demonstrate that application of this Urban Kaya Relation will enable a comprehensive understanding about the intrinsic factors determining emission efficiencies in large cities by applying it to a global dataset of 61 cities. Contrary to traditional urban scaling studies which use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, we show that the Reduced Major Axis (RMA) is necessary when complex relations among scaling exponents are to be investigated. RMA is given by the geometric mean of the two OLS slopes obtained by interchanging the dependent and independent variable. We discuss the potential of the Urban Kaya Relation in mainstreaming local actions for climate change mitigation.

Due to the opposite transformations of Cd and As, their simultaneous immobilization poses numerous concerns. Thus, there is an urgent need to simultaneously reduce Cd and As mobility and plant uptake in co-contaminated soil. Our previous work found that goethite-modified biochar amendments effectively reduced Cd and As uptake by Chinese cabbage; however, their residual impact on subsequent crops must be investigated. In the current work, the following maize (Zea mays L.) was grown after Chinese cabbage in Cd and As co-contaminated soil amended by biochar (BC), goethite (G), and goethite-modified biochar (GBC) at a 1% application rate. The synthesis of GBCs involved two different initial mass ratios of iron/biochar (Fe/BC), with GBC1 having a Fe/BC ratio of 1:1 and GBC2 having a Fe/BC ratio of 2:1. The current study assessed the residual impacts of BC, G, and GBC amendments on Cd and As mobility, uptake by maize, and their impacts on maize growth. The results revealed that GBC amendments enhanced maize growth, chlorophyll content, and gas exchange parameters compared to raw BC and G. Moreover, the GBC1 amendment lowered Cd and As uptake by maize shoots (29.48% and 61.56%) and roots (33.07% and 37.32%), respectively, compared to unamended soil (CK). The GBC1 amendment decreased the bioaccessibility of Cd and As by 24.37% and 37.44%, respectively, compared with CK. In general, the results demonstrated that GBC has a significant residual impact on maize growth and Cd and As uptake in co-contaminated soil.																			1532-0383	1549-7887				2023 MAY 4	2023										10.1080/15320383.2023.2208673	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2023.2208673		MAY 2023											WOS:000980861000001

However, the response of different soil C pools to litter and nutrient addition during the long-term secondary succession process remains unclear. We conducted a mesocosm study to reveal the dynamics of different soil C pools. Soil was incubated with litter and nutrient addition collected from five successional stages in the Ziwuling forest region in China. We then used the three-transfer-pool model to simulate C pool dynamics with C emissions data. Litter addition promoted slow C pool emissions during the early stages of secondary succession but inhibited active C pool and passive C pool emissions. Nutrient addition had positive effects on the emissions of C pools, with the exception of passive C pool; nitrogen addition had stronger effects on active C pool, and phosphorus addition had stronger effects on slow C pool. The effects of all addition treatments on the C emissions gradually decreased as succession progressed. The soil C emission sources differed under litter and nutrient addition during secondary succession. The priming effect and nutrient limitation contribute to changes in the soil C cycle.

However, the variation pattern and its key influencing factorsremain unclear. Taking a silt loam soil as the research object, this study used the orthogonal table of L-9 (3(4)) to arrange four influencing factors at three levels: straw length (2, 5, 8 cm), straw returning amount (2000, 4000, 8000 kg h m(-2)), nitrogen amount (100, 140, 180 kg hm(-2)), and polyphenol amount (0, 40, 80 kg hm(-2)). Rill erodibility (k(d)) and soil critical shear stress (z(c)), representing the soil resistance to rill erosion, were measured twice by submerged jet equipment in August 2020 and 2021. The results presented significant temporal variations in k(d) and z(c) with changes in straw decomposition and soil properties after straw incorporation. Compared with the results on day 60 following straw incorporation, k(d) and z(c) decreased by 57.07% and 25.11% on day 425, respectively. On day 425, the straw length, straw returning amount, and nitrogen amount had significant effects on k(d) (P < 0.05), with the contributions of 7.97%, 42.06%, and 7.62%. Conversely, the straw returning amount and polyphenol amount had significant effects on z(c), with respective contributions of 50.88% and 11.24%. The variation of k(d) and z(c) could be linearly fitted by the soil aggregate greater than 0.25 mm, with R-2 values of 0.71 and 0.87, respectively, which could be used to estimate rill channel scour depth in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool in the absence of measured data on soil resistance to rill erosion.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				OCT	2022	217								106502	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106502	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106502		JUN 2022											WOS:000822948300002

Changes in grazing management can, therefore, affect the carbon stock potential of rangelands. Despite rangeland ecosystems being important global sinks for carbon, we know relatively little about the effect of traditional grazing management practices on their potential to store carbon. In this study, we evaluated the carbon stock and change rate of rangelands using three traditional grazing management practices in the semiarid pastoral ecosystem of eastern Ethiopia. By comparing data on vegetation and soil carbon stocks, we found that there was a strong significant difference (p < 0.001) between these different management practices. In particular, the establishment of enclosures was associated with an annual increase in carbon stocks of soil (3%) and woody (11.9%) and herbaceous (57.6%) biomass, when compared to communal open lands. Both enclosure and browsing management practices were found to have the highest levels of soil organic carbon stocks, differing only in terms of the amount of woody and herbaceous biomass. Thus, modest changes in traditional grazing management practices can play an important role in carbon storage and sequestration. Further research is required on a wider range of traditional pastoral management practices across space and time, as understanding these processes is key to combating global climate change.

We tested the hypotheses that (1) mobilized 'calcium-bound inorganic P' (Ca-P-i) is a major source of plant-available P in alpine meadows with alkaline soils after long-term warming, (2) mobilization of Ca-P-i is linked to effective plant carboxylate-releasing P-acquisition strategies under warming, and (3) the mobilization is also related to plant nitrogen (N)-acquisition. We conducted an 8-year warming experiment in an alpine meadow (4635 m above sea level) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. A significant increase in P concentration in both aboveground and belowground biomass indicates an increased mobilization and assimilation of P by plants under warming. We observed a significant decrease in Ca-P-i, no change in moderately-labile organic P, and an increase in highly resistant organic P after warming. There was no increase in phosphatase activities. Our results indicate that Ca-P-i, rather than organic P was the major source of plant-available P for alpine meadows under warming. Higher leaf manganese concentrations of sedges and forbs after warming indicate that carboxylates released by these plants are a key mechanism of Ca-P-i mobilization. The insignificant increase in Rhizobiales after warming and the very small cover of legumes show a minor role of N-acquisition strategies in solubilizing phosphate. The insignificant change in relative abundance of mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria related to P cycling after warming shows a small contribution of microorganisms to Ca-P-i mobilization. The significant increase in leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratio of grasses and no change in sedge leaf N:P ratio reflect distinct responses of plant nutrient status to warming due to differences in P-acquisition strategies. We highlight the important effects of belowground P-acquisition strategies, especially plant carboxylate-releasing P-acquisition strategies on responses of plants to global changes in alpine meadows.

The transition from 'well-marked varieties' of a single species into 'well-defined species'-especially in the absence of geographic barriers to gene flow (sympatric speciation)-has puzzled evolutionary biologists ever since Darwin(1,2). Gene flow counteracts the buildup of genome-wide differentiation, which is a hallmark of speciation and increases the likelihood of the evolution of irreversible reproductive barriers (incompatibilities) that complete the speciation process(3). Theory predicts that the genetic architecture of divergently selected traits can influence whether sympatric speciation occurs(4), but empirical tests of this theory are scant because comprehensive data are difficult to collect and synthesize across species, owing to their unique biologies and evolutionary histories(5). Here, within a young species complex of neotropical cichlid fishes (Amphilophus spp.), we analysed genomic divergence among populations and species. By generating a new genome assembly and re-sequencing 453 genomes, we uncovered the genetic architecture of traits that have been suggested to be important for divergence. Species that differ in monogenic or oligogenic traits that affect ecological performance and/or mate choice show remarkably localized genomic differentiation. By contrast, differentiation among species that have diverged in polygenic traits is genomically widespread and much higher overall, consistent with the evolution of effective and stable genome-wide barriers to gene flow. Thus, we conclude that simple trait architectures are not always as conducive to speciation with gene flow as previously suggested, whereas polygenic architectures can promote rapid and stable speciation in sympatry.

The effects of grass combined with BSCs on slope hydrology and soil erosion during rainfall are still unclear. In this study, simulated rainfall experiments were applied to a soil flume with four different slope cover treatments, namely, bare soil (CK), grass cover (GC), BSC, and GC + BSC, to observe the processes of runoff and sediment yield. Additionally, the soil moisture at different depths during infiltration was observed. The results showed that the runoff generated by rainfall for all treatments was in the following order: BSC > GC + BSC > CK > GC. Compared with CK, GC promoted infiltration, and BSC inhibited infiltration. The BSCs obviously inhibited infiltration at a depth of 8 cm. When the rainfall continued to infiltrate down to 16 and 24 cm, the effects of grass on promoting infiltration were stronger than those of BSCs on inhibiting infiltration. Compared with CK, the flow velocity of the BSC, GC and GC + BSC treatments was reduced by 62.8%, 32.3% and 68.3%, respectively. The BSCs and grass increased the critical shear stress by increasing the resistance. Additionally, the average sediment yield of GC and both treatments with BSCs was reduced by 80.8% and >99%, respectively, compared with CK. The soil erosion process was dominated by the soil detachment capacity in the CK, BSC and GC + BSC treatments, while the GC treatment showed a transport-limited process. This study provides a scientific basis for the reasonable spatial allocation of vegetation in arid and semiarid areas and the correction of vegetation cover factors in soil erosion prediction models.

J	Hao, WL; Xia, B; Li, J; Xu, MX				Hao, Wanglin; Xia, Bin; Li, Jun; Xu, Mingxiang			Deep soil CO2 flux with strong temperature dependence contributes considerably to soil-atmosphere carbon flux	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The diffusion of CO2 produced by carbon mineralization in vertical profiles is an important CO2 emission process. However, because of the relatively slow rate of change in the subsoil environment compared with the surface soil, carbon mineralization and diffusion are often ignored, and the mechanisms that transfer deep carbon to the soil-atmosphere interface are still unclear. We studied vertical differences in CO2 flux and its driving mechanism in layers situated from 0 to 200 cm in Robinia pseudoacacia plantations with different stand ages on the Loess Plateau under a typical temperate continental semi-arid monsoon climate. The results showed that (1) in the 0-200 cm layer, CO2 flux showed a bimodal seasonal trend, and total CO2 flux of Robinia pseudoacacia forests with a 10 years stand age fluctuated more actively among the months (Standard Deviation: 3.28%-9.57%). (2) Dynamic evaluation of contribution rate showed a stable (21.81-24.42%) contribution of deep CO2 flux to soil atmosphere interface. (3) Temperature sensitivity of CO2 flux (expressed as Q10) significantly increased with soil depth, moisture and soil CO2 flux presented stronger quadratic function relation in deep layers than shallow layers. There was a significant positive correlation between deep CO2 flux and soil organic carbon (SOC), but there was a weak negative correlation in the shallow layers. The CO2 flux in the shallow layers was mainly regulated by soil organic carbon, whereas that in the deep layers was more regulated by soil temperature.(4) Compared with the traditional hydrothermal two-factor model, the new T&M&C (temperature & moisture & organic carbon) model can improve the model precision by 20-25%, especially in the prediction of CO2 flux in deep layers. Overall, this study is significant for understanding the stability and dynamic changes in the soil carbon pool, and the mechanism of deep organic carbon diffusion to the soil-atmosphere interface in the Loess Plateau.					qi, li/JFE-7167-2023; Wang, Tianqi/JJD-7473-2023; Zhang, Lijun/JEZ-7925-2023; liu, jiaming/IWE-3196-2023; yuan, liping/JPK-7584-2023; zhang, chen/JES-0371-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1201-2023; Zhang, Yunyi/JHS-3626-2023; Xu, Ming/IWM-0504-2023; liu, junyang/IXD-1252-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023; Liu, Yujie/IWU-6535-2023; liu, lin/JFK-3401-2023; Zhang, Xiaofeng/JMC-6060-2023; Li, Jiawei/JOJ-9277-2023; wang, wei/JBS-7400-2023; wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023; lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023; Wang, Luyao/JLL-2001-2023; Yang, Mei/JNS-2225-2023; Ding, Yang/JUV-4842-2023; .., What/IXW-6776-2023; zhou, han/JUV-0193-2023; zhang, yimeng/JLL-7337-2023; peng, yan/JCO-1763-2023; LI, XIAO/JCE-6169-2023	Liu, Yujie/0000-0002-1153-6156; Zhang, Xiaofeng/0000-0003-2738-3286; 													1574-9541	1878-0512				MAY	2023	74								101957	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101957	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101957		DEC 2022											WOS:000916617400001

However, government policy is to reduce the number of livestock due to the large quantities of greenhouse gasses (GHG), in particular methane, produced by ruminants and the degradation of the grasslands. For this policy to be effective, with little effect on livelihoods, there should be a decoupling of GHG emissions from economic growth of livestock products. This study examined the synergetic effects of policies, extreme climate events and GHG emissions from livestock at the headwater region of the Yellow River since 1980. Optimization models of GHG emissions efficiency and drivers were developed and parameterized. Trade-offs between GHG emissions from livestock and economic growth from livestock, determined by the decoupling model, showed that from 1980 to 2015: 1) the GHG emissions decreased by 39%; (2) CH4 emissions from livestock decreased by 33%, and yaks emitted the most (accounted for 99.6%) among livestock; (3) N2O emissions decreased by 34%; (4) trade-offs between livestock GHG emissions and grassland uptake indicated that the grazing livestock system functioned as a net carbon sink; (5) the efficiency factor, especially technical efficiency, was the main driver of GHG emissions; and (6) GHG emissions from livestock were in a decoupling state from economic growth from livestock. However, decoupling has not been stable as inter-annual fluctuations have been large mainly due to extreme climatic events, such as snowstorm disasters, which indicates that the grazing system was still relatively fragile. The GHG emissions can be reduced further by mitigating CH4 emissions, and enhancing CO2 sequestration on grazed pastureland. The ongoing transformation of livestock industry development on the Tibetan plateau is associated with uncertainty under the background of global GHG mitigation.

J	Wang, L; Zheng, FL; Hu, W; Zhang, XCJ; Shi, HQ				Wang, Lun; Zheng, Fenli; Hu, Wei; Zhang, Xunchang J.; Shi, Hongqiang			Interactive effects of rainfall intensity, kinetic energy and antecedent soil moisture regime on splash erosion in the Ultisol region of South China	CATENA												Splash erosion has been acknowledged as a key process of water erosion, depending on multiple factors including rainfall and soil properties, antecedent soil moisture, and surface runoff. Previous studies mostly focused on the effect of simple factors on splash erosion, but the interactive effects of multiple factors on splash erosion are still obscure. Therefore, we investigated the characteristics of splash erosion under simulated rainfall and quantified the interactive effects of multiple factors on splash erosion using a modified splash pan for measuring directional splash erosion. The results showed that total splash erosion (summation of four directional splash erosion) and net splash erosion (downslope minus upslope splash erosion) ranged from 14.4 to 804.8 g m- 2 and 2.0 to 186.5 g m- 2, respectively, and both increased with rainfall intensity and rainfall kinetic energy. The splash erosion rates in the dry run were greater than those in the wet run at the earlier stage, whereas after runoff occurred, the splash erosion rates in the dry run were lower than those in the wet run. Furthermore, the calculated variance contributions indicated that before runoff occurrence, rainfall kinetic energy (KE) and antecedent soil moisture (theta a) were the dominant factors affecting splash erosion, accounting for 25.3 % and 15.0 % of variance contributions, respectively. After runoff occurrence, the main factors affecting splash erosion were rainfall intensity (RI), rainfall kinetic energy (KE) and their interactions, explaining 98.2 % of the total splash and 95.7 % of the net splash for all variance contributions. In addition, the effect of shallow flow on splash erosion was dependent on the ratio of flow depth and raindrop diameter (h/D). The thresholds of h/D seemingly ranged from 0.63 to 0.86 and 0.77 to 1.02 for the dry and wet runs under 100 mm h-1 rainfall intensity. This study provides a basis for understanding splash erosion mechanisms and improving process-based erosion models.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				MAR	2023	222								106863	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106863		DEC 2022											WOS:000912461500001

Yet the coupled effects of film mulching with different optical properties and deficit irrigation on water and temperature variation within the soil-crop system and on plant growth in arid areas have not been well-investigated. A two-year field experiment was conducted with five treatments: 1) full irrigation without mulching (FN), 2) full irrigation with transparent plastic film mulching (FT), 3) full irrigation with black plastic film mulching (FB), 4) deficit irrigation with transparent plastic film mulching (DT), and 5) deficit irrigation without mulching (DN). The results showed that plastic film mulching significantly increased soil water in the 80-120 cm soil layer and canopy air humidity. The alternating wet-dry behavior of soil water caused by plastic film mulching was an effective water utilization strategy that increased crop water productivity. DT stimulated the alternating wet-dry behavior of soil water in the 0-80 cm layer more than the FN. This alternating behavior was characterized by relatively wet soil at the 12-leaf growth stage (V12), relatively dry soil from V12 to the grain-filling growth stage (R3), and relatively wet soil again after R3. Alternating wet-dry behavior changed from wet to dry at V12 in 2019 and was earlier than V12 in 2020. Plastic film mulching significantly increased soil temperature at the six-leaf growth stage (V6) and decreased canopy air temperature during the whole maize growing seasons. The higher net photosynthesis rate was observed at the canopy air relative humidity of 78.6%. Net photosynthesis rate decreased with increasing canopy air temperature. FT, FB, DT, and FN significantly increased grain yields over DN by 39.7-45.8%, 25.5-41.8%, 18.2-33.4%, and 9.0-17.0%, respectively, and increased net income over DN by 894-1127, 436-979, 343-844, and 166-429 USD ha-1, respectively. DT decreased net income and output/input ratio by 28.1% and 10.9% in 2019, respectively, compared with FT. However, these values were 12.3% and 4.0% in the relatively wet growing season in 2020. Deficit irrigation combined with transparent plastic film mulching can ensure an acceptable maize grain yield and net income in arid areas with limited water resources, especially in growing seasons with greater rainfall.					wu, wenjie/IUN-9258-2023; wu, wenjie/HKM-3623-2023	Li, Yue/0000-0002-9358-8178													0378-3774	1873-2283				MAY 1	2022	265								107536	10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107536	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2022.107536		FEB 2022											WOS:000792812000001

Improved crop management practices are needed to increase teff productivity and decrease production costs. Here, we used a split-split plot design to evaluate the impacts of different tillage, sowing, and soil compaction practices, and their combinations, on agronomic performance, weed population, lodging, and cost in teff production at the Aba Gerima watershed in northwestern Ethiopia in 2018-2020. Reduced tillage (RT) improved soil moisture, resulting in increased agronomic performance and decreased production costs compared with conventional tillage (CT); however, the weed population was substantially larger with RT than with CT. Row planting (RP) reduced seed cost and lodging but increased sowing and weeding costs compared with broadcast planting (BP). Plant population and leaf area index were substantially greater with BP than with RP during early-stage growth, but this reversed during late-stage growth. Despite labor costs being significantly greater with (WC) compaction than without (NC), little to no differences were observed in the weed population or in agronomic performance. Partial cost-benefit analysis revealed that RT-RP-WC followed by RT-RP-NC was the most economical treatment combination, suggesting that RT-RP-NC could be a labor-effective means of increasing teff production by smallholder farms in Ethiopia.

Despite the significant amount of research on this topic, quantifying these processes at large- or regional-scale remains difficult. Furthermore, very few studies provide integrated assessments of land susceptibility to both water and wind erosion. Therefore, this study investigated the spatial patterns of water and wind erosion risks, first separately and then combined, in the drought-prone region of East Africa using the best available datasets. As to water erosion, we adopted the spatially distributed version of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation and compared our estimates with plot-scale measurements and watershed sediment yield (SY) data. The order of magnitude of our soil loss estimates by water erosion is within the range of measured plot-scale data. Moreover, despite the fact that SY integrates different soil erosion and sediment deposition processes within watersheds, we observed a strong correlation of SY with our estimated soil loss rates (r(2) = 0.4). For wind erosion, we developed a wind erosion index by integrating five relevant factors using fuzzy logic technique. We compared this index with estimates of the frequency of dust storms, derived from long-term Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor Level-3 daily data. This comparison revealed an overall accuracy of 70%. According to our estimates, mean annual gross soil loss by water erosion amounts to 4 billion t, with a mean soil loss rate of 6.3 t ha(-1) yr(-1), of which ca. 50% was found to originate in Ethiopia. In terms of land cover, ca. 50% of the soil loss by water erosion originates from crop-land (with a mean soil loss rate of 18.4 t ha(-1) yr(-1)), which covers ca. 15% of the total area in the study region. Model results showed that nearly 10% of the East Africa region is subject to moderate or elevated water erosion risks (>10 t ha(-1) yr(-1)). With respect to wind erosion, we estimated that around 25% of the study area is experiencing moderate or elevated wind erosion risks (equivalent to a frequency of dust storms >45 days yr(-1)), of which Sudan and Somalia (which are dominated by bare/sparse vegetation cover) have the largest share (ca. 90%). In total, an estimated 8 million ha is exposed to moderate or elevated risks of soil erosion by both water and wind. The results of this study provide new insights on the spatial patterns of water and wind erosion risks in East Africa and can be used to prioritize areas where further investigations are needed and where remedial actions should be implemented.

We quantify the direct and indirect effects of vegetation restoration on runoff and sediment yield on hillslopes in the field to improve environmental governance. Methods An artificial rainfall experiment at a rainfall intensity of 120 mm h(-1) and a slope gradient of 22 degrees were used to distinguish the effects of vegetation restoration on runoff and sediment yield. Results Compared to the farmland slopes, vegetation restoration directly prolonged the time-to-runoff by 140%, reduced the runoff rate by 20%, and increased the soil infiltration capacity by 15%. Vegetation restoration indirectly delayed the time-to-runoff by 120%, reduced the runoff rate and sediment yield rate by 50% and 94%, respectively, and increased the soil infiltration capacity by 58% on the hillslopes with vegetation restoration. Conclusions The direct effects of vegetation restoration on runoff and sediment yield were lower than its indirect impacts. Vegetation cover, decreases in soil bulk density, and increases in belowground root biomasses and > 0.25 mm aggregate stability were the primary causes of runoff and sediment yield reduction on the slopes with vegetation restoration.

To quantify interrill and rill erosion and their spatial development, four 30-min rainfalls at 90 mm h(-1) intensity were consecutively simulated on runoff plots packed with a loess at six slopes of 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees, 25 degrees, 30 degrees and 35 degrees. The soil surface was measured using the structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry upon each simulation run, and the runoff and sediment samples were collected and measured at every 10 min. Rills did not develop until the third simulation run. During the initial two runs, the lower third section was more severely eroded than the upper and middle thirds along the slope direction, yet the interrill erosion was statistically uniform from left to right. Rills tended to emerge by both sidewalls and in the lower portion in the third run. The corresponding rill erosion increased with slope from 10 degrees to 20 degrees and then decreased for the slopes steeper, which was consistent with the slope trend of the sediment yield directly measured. The rills expanded substantially primarily via head retreat and to a lesser extent via sideward erosion after receiving another 30-min rainfall. Rill erosion contributed 69.3% of the total erosion loss, and shifted the critical slope corresponding to the maximum loss from 20 degrees to 25 degrees. These findings demonstrate the significance of rill erosion not only in total soil loss but also in its relation to slope, as well as the effectiveness of SfM photogrammetry in quantifying interrill and rill erosion.

Therefore, the microplastic contamination in agricultural areas requires being investigated urgently. In addition, the occurrence characteristics of microplastics are also different in agricultural areas with various land use modes. In this study, the main agricultural areas in Xinjiang are taken as the research object. The abundance of microplastics in the main agricultural areas in Xinjiang ranges from 288 to 1452 items/kg. The shape of microplastics is mainly bulks, and white microplastics account for the highest proportion, and the majority of their sizes are less than 0.5 mm. The risk assessment results show that the contamination risk index of microplastics in this area is 108.92 and the risk level is grade III. The research shows that there is little difference in the abundance of microplastics between paddy field and garden land, which may be because there are few sources of microplastics in the land of these two utilization modes, and the potential pollution sources are similar, such as the atmospheric deposition of microplastics, the falling of fibers on people's clothes during farming, and the agricultural use of sludge. This study can provide a reference for further study on the existing circumstances of microplastics in agricultural areas.

J	Zeng, Y; Yang, XK; Fang, NF; Shi, ZH				Zeng, Yi; Yang, Xiankun; Fang, Nufang; Shi, Zhihua			Large-scale afforestation significantly increases permanent surface water in China's vegetation restoration regions	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												China is facing the challenge of the uncertain impacts of large-scale afforestation on regional water resources. However, the effects of vegetation cover changes on the variation in surface water at the regional scale are still controversial. Here, we focused on the 0.9 million km(2) vegetation restoration region in China, where the highest significant vegetation cover changes on the earth. Multi-source remote sensing data were used to describe the characteristics of seasonality and transition of surface water and to analyse the causes of surface water changes from climate, vegetation cover and other human factors. Our results show that the annual maximum NDVI of Northeast region (NE) and Loess Plateau region (LP) increased significantly from 0.74 to 0.85 and 0.49 to 0.62 from 2000 to 2015, respectively. Meanwhile, permanent water, as a vital component of surface water, exhibited net increases of 695.6 km(2) and 119.4 km(2) in NE and LP from 2000 to 2015, respectively. The extension in permanent water and the implementation of ecological projects exhibited highly consistent spatiotemporal patterns. Statistical analysis indicated that vegetation cover is an important factor in controlling permanent water changes. Human activities such as building dams and reservoirs are also an important explanatory variable for permanent water increases. The newly built dams contributed 43% in NE and 25% in LP to the increase in permanent water. In addition, although climatic factors were not the main factor influencing permanent water, precipitation significantly affected the total surface water in NE. These findings have potential implications for understanding surface water and forest dynamics and formulating regional development plans in the vegetation restoration region in China.

J	Fan, MH; Li, JJ; Tang, ZS; Shangguan, ZP				Fan, Miaochun; Li, Jiajia; Tang, Zhuangsheng; Shangguan, Zhouping			Soil bacterial community succession during desertification in a desert steppe ecosystem	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Desertification often occurs in fragile steppe ecosystems, which may lead to severe soil degradation. Understanding how soil microbial communities respond to desertification is critical for ecological restoration of degraded desert steppes. We used an Ion S5 (TM) XL sequencing platform to explore the soil bacterial community succession across four desertification stages in a desert steppe in Ningxia, China. The results showed that soils from potential to light desertification stage had similar physicochemical properties, whereas significantly lower macronutrients, silt, and clay contents and higher pH, moisture, and sand contents were observed in the severe and very severe stages . Due to change in soil conditions, bacterial communities shifted drastically across the four stages. Variation in bacterial community composition was driven mainly by the deterministic processes (i.e., habitat filtering based on resource availability and space limitations), but their effects decreased toward the very severe desertification stage. More potential indicator species including members of the genera Nitrosomonas, Pirellula, and Methylobacterium were selected to predict very severe desertification relative to the other three stages. These potential indicators could survive in a wide range of habitats with low availability of carbon and nitrogen sources. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that most of soil microorganisms might form symbiotic relationships in response to the habitat heterogeneity caused by desertification. In conclusion, as desertification intensified, distinct shifts in soil bacterial communities were driven primarily by the deterministic processes, which provide new insights for the restoration of degraded habitats and sustainable development of land resources.

PEERJ												Information on the homogeneity and distribution of (13)carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) labeling in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is limited. We conducted a dual labeling experiment to evaluate the variability of C-13 and N-15 enrichment in aboveground parts of labeled winter wheat plants. Labeling with C-13 and N-15 was performed on nonnitrogen fertilized (-N) and nitrogen fertilized (+N, 250 kg N ha(-1)) plants at the elongation and grain filling stages. Aboveground parts of wheat were destructively sampled at 28 days after labeling. As winter wheat growth progressed, delta C-13 values of wheat ears increased significantly, whereas those of leaves and stems decreased significantly. At the elongation stage, N addition tended to reduce the aboveground delta C-13 values through dilution of C uptake. At the two stages, upper (newly developed) leaves were more highly enriched with C-13 compared with that of lower (aged) leaves. Variability between individual wheat plants and among pots at the grain filling stage was smaller than that at the elongation stage, especially for the N treatment. Compared with those of C-13 labeling, differences in N-15 excess between aboveground components (leaves and stems) under N-15 labeling conditions were much smaller. We conclude that non-N fertilization and labeling at the grain filling stage may produce more uniformly C-13-labeled wheat materials, whereas the materials were more highly C-13-enriched at the elongation stage, although the delta C-13 values were more variable. The N-15-enriched straw tissues via urea fertilization were more uniformly labeled at the grain filling stage compared with that at the elongation stage.

From November 2019 to March 2020 (dry season), we studied autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic (Rh) soil respiration. At highlands, grazing land (1.18 +/- 0.13 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and teff croplands (1.36 +/- 0.14 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) had the lowest Rh, while acacia decurrens plantations (1.94 +/- 0.19 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were the largest. When compared to teff (2.08 +/- 0.20 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and khat (1.73 +/- 0.24 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), grazing land in the midland had a lower Rh (1.18 +/- 0.13 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Ra on teff (1.51 +/- 0.27 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was substantially (P < 0.05) greater than on grazing land (1.08 +/- 0.32 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) in the highlands. Grazing lands (1.54 +/- 0.21 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) have a considerably (P < 0.05) greater Ra than farmlands (teff, 0.20 +/- 0.07 mu mol m(-2) s(-1); groundnut, 0.09 +/- 0.03 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) in lowlands. Growing teff in the highlands and midlands will result in higher CO2 fluxes into the atmosphere. However, in-depth research is needed to implement effective land management that reduces CO2 emissions.

The hydraulic resistance to overland flow under disturbed vegetation is critical in the study of water and soil conservation. A series of experiments on runoff hydraulics was conducted on exposed slopes and surfaces with grass cover. Wheatgrass patches with vegetation density ranging from 0.58% to 5.76% and inflows ranging from 5 to 40 L/ min, incorporating slopes ranging from 4 degrees to 12 degrees were used in this study. A total of 264 groups of hydraulic runoff tests were conducted. The test results showed that, with increasing vegetation density, the flow pattern evolved from transient to turbulent flow. Both vegetation density and slope affected the Froude number (Fr). Vegetation density is an essential factor affecting flow resistance. On the premise of variation in vegetation density, the Kendall coefficient of Re and flow resistance exceeded 0.727, and the Spearman correlation coefficient exceeded 0.872. The total resistance of overland flow under vegetation cover can be divided into form resistance and grain resistance. With increased vegetation density, the proportion of form resistance of the total resistance increased from 95% to 99%. Vegetation was the main factor that constitutes flow resistance and controls soil erosion. These results are helpful for understanding the influence of vegetation community distribution on mechanisms of slope runoff and soil erosion.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2020	591								125594	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125594	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125594													WOS:000599757800098

Due to the amplifying effect of climate change, the QTP has experienced rapid warming and shifting precipitation in recent decades, profoundly impacting the local ecosystem. However, the specific details of how vegetation responds to these changes were unclear, and the corresponding contributions were poorly quantified. Here, we employed an elastic net regression model to investigate the sensitivity of vegetation to climate factors across multiple time scales and various seasons. The vegetation activity was represented by the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), while climate change was represented by temperature, precipitation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and soil moisture fraction (SMF). During 2000-2020, approximately 50 % of the QTP area showed greening, mainly concentrated in the northern region. Climate change explained approximately 70 % of the variation in vegetation during the growing season, 39 % in spring and 66 % in autumn. Grasslands exhibited the highest sensitive to climate change, with a relative contribution of 83 %, followed by mixed forests (70 %), forests (53 %) and deserts (52 %). Both temperature and precipitation significantly affected vegetation, with relative contributions of 29 % and 22 %, respectively, during the growing season. PAR and SMF had less impact on vegetation, with relative contributions of 8 % and 12 %, respectively. In the greening region, precipitation (26 %) was more important for vegetation growth compared to temperature (25 %). These findings emphasize the importance of precipitation on vegetation on the QTP, providing valuable insights for improving regional ecosystem assessment model and promoting the restoration of fragile ecosystems.					; /J-8497-2013; , Ping/ACH-8897-2022	shi, shi shang yu/0000-0001-5606-5127; /0000-0002-5213-4399; , Ping/0000-0003-2481-9953													0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2023	233								107483	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107483		SEP 2023											WOS:001074366400001

However, these studies equivalently stacked multimodal data and underused canopy spatial information. In this study, multimodal imagery fusion (MIF) attention was proposed to dynamically fuse UAV-based RGB, hyperspectral near-infrared (HNIR), and thermal imagery. Based on the MIF attention, a novel model termed MultimodalNet was proposed for field-scale yield prediction of winter wheat. To compare multimodal imagery-based and multimodal features-based methods, a stacking-based ensemble learning model was built using UAV-based canopy spectral, thermal, and texture features. The results showed that the MultimodalNet achieved accurate results at the reproductive stage and performed better than any single modality in the fusion. The MultimodalNet performed best at the flowering stage, with a coefficient of determination of 0.7411 and a mean absolute percentage error of 6.05%. The HNIR and thermal imagery were essential in yield prediction of winter wheat at the reproductive stage. Compared to equivalent stacking fusion, dynamic fusion through adaptively adjusting modality attention improved the model accuracy and adaptability across winter wheat cultivars and water treatments. Equivalently stacking more modalities did not necessarily yield improved performance than dynamically fusing fewer modalities. Methods using multimodal UAV imagery with rich spatial information were more applicable than methods using multi -modal features to field-scale yield prediction. This study indicates that the MultimodalNet makes a powerful tool for field-scale yield prediction of winter wheat.					yang, rui/JHI-3328-2023; liu, huan/JKI-3764-2023; liu, huan/JEO-4705-2023; li, wenjing/JMP-7498-2023; wang, yixuan/JGM-3893-2023; WANG, Bin/JGM-2639-2023; Wang, Minghao/JMD-0670-2023; wang, hao/JKH-5890-2023; wang, wenxin/JOZ-3291-2023; luo, yuan/JLS-6416-2023; wang, hang/JND-8481-2023; Chen, Xin/JDN-2017-2023; Li, jiaqi/JOZ-6395-2023; wang, jiaqi/JSL-7112-2023; Liu, yujing/JQI-7225-2023; Zhang, Can/JUU-9511-2023; WANG, HUI/JFA-9683-2023; LIU, HUI/JPX-8014-2023; Wang, Hao/ABB-8923-2020	Wang, Hao/0000-0001-9109-6017; Ma, Juncheng/0000-0001-5750-9295													1569-8432	1872-826X				APR	2023	118								103292	10.1016/j.jag.2023.103292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2023.103292		APR 2023											WOS:000979516600001

To better understand how land-use conversion and agricultural erosion separately affect aggregateassociated nitrogen (N) and organic carbon (OC), we examined the responses of aggregate-associated N and OC to both the converting forest to agricultural land and erosion in the agricultural region of Northeast China. Non-erosion sites in forest and agricultural land converted from forestland 60 years ago were selected to address the effects of land-use change. The sites with various erosion intensities in an eroding area of sloping cropland (i. e., non-erosion, light erosion, moderate erosion and heavy erosion) were selected to compare the effects of the erosion intensity. The measured soil metrics included the soil bulk density, water-stable aggregates, and aggregate-associated OC and N along 0-70 cm soil profiles. Converting forest to agricultural land did not significantly influence the OC and N concentrations in each aggregate, while the land-use change significantly reduced the OC and N stocks in macroaggregates but increased them in microaggregates and silt+clay fraction. However, erosion significantly decreased the OC and N concentrations and stocks in each aggregate. The changes in the OC and N stocks in aggregates were mainly due to the depletion of soil aggregates in responding to the conversion of forest to agricultural land but due to decreases in OC and N concentrations in aggregates in responding to soil erosion. Our results indicated that the effects of erosion on aggregate-associated OC and N were greater compared with the effects of converting forest to agricultural land in this Mollisol region.

Ecological stoichiometry, which indicates the balance of elements and the flow of energy, plays a vital role in exploring biogeochemical cycling in ecosystems. To investigate the carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balance and flow of energy, the stoichiometry characteristics and stoichiometry homeostasis for introduced and natural forests on the Loess Plateau, four typical forests were selected, including three introduced forests composed of Robinta pseudoacacia (R. pseudoacacia), Pinus tabuliforrnis (P. tabuliforinis) and Platycladus orientalis (P. orientalis) and a natural forest composed of Quercus wutaishansea (Q. wutaishansea) and the C, N and P in the plant-litter-soil system were measured. The results showed that the C, N and P contents and C:N:P in leaves, branches, fruits, litters and soils varied widely and were influenced strongly by forest species. The N content in R. pseudoacacia leaves, branches, fruits and litters and the soil C, N and P contents in Quercus wutaishansea were higher than those in other forest species. The soil C:N:P stoichiometry in Quercus wutaishansea was higher than that in introduced forest species, while the reverse was found for plant tissues and litter C:N:P. According to the leaf N:P, with the exception of R. pseudoacacia, growth of the other three forest species was limited by N. The N, P and N:P homeostasis exist in trees, especially in Quercus wutaishansea, forest species and plant tissues had significant effects on the strength of homeostasis. Overall, the results of C, N and P content and stoichiometric homeostasis revealed that the natural forest was more adaptable to the arid environment in the Loess Plateau compared to the introduced forests.

Analyses of trends in the turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity can be informative of the processes response to N addition and desertification in desert steppe ecosystems. Our investigation of the changes in beta diversity under desertification and N addition in a desert steppe ecosystem in northern China showed desertification to significantly decrease beta diversity among communities, which leads to species homogenization. Further, decreases to the turnover component of beta diversity was likely an important factor causing homogenization under desertification. Although nitrogen addition did not fundamentally influence beta diversity, dissimilarity caused by nestedness significantly increased with nitrogen addition. The contrasting effects of desertification and N addition on the turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity suggest that the ordered loss of plant species with desertification improvement. Overall, our findings provide strong evidence that the effects of desertification and N addition on beta diversity change with ecological processes. We recommend that conservation strategies that focus management practices on prevention of desertification will be most effective in maintaining species diversity.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014	zhouping, shangguan/0000-0002-5815-6310													0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2019	138						54	60		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.07.013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2019.07.013													WOS:000485660800008

Allan			Behavioural characteristics of yaks grazing summer and winter pastures on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE												The yak is the primary herbivore grazing on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, an area characterized by extremely harsh conditions and a very short vegetation growing season. Herbage quantity and quality peak in summer when it is lush and green, but is dry and withered in winter when it is scarce and of poor quality. Traditionally, yaks graze only natural pasture all year without supplements and have adapted well to the extreme winter conditions. Grazing behaviour has been used as an indicator for grazing management decisions and, in this study, was measured in five 4 to 8 years old yak cows suckling calves during summer and winter on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. The diurnal behavioural patterns were similar in the two seasons. Grazing time and jaw movements per hour increased at dawn (07:00), remained relatively steady and then decreased at dusk (19:00), whereas ruminations, mastications and boluses per hour exhibited an opposite trend and decreased at dawn, and then increased after dusk. Seasonally, with a decrease in herbage quality from summer to winter, yaks decreased grazing and ruminating times and walking distance (P < 0.05) and increased drinking and idling times (P < 0.05). Air temperature was the primary meteorological variable affecting yak behaviour and was correlated positively with grazing time, ruminating time, the rate of mastications while ruminating, boluses formed and mastications per bolus (P < 0.05). In addition, wind velocity and precipitation significantly influenced the grazing behaviour of yaks (P < 0.05). We concluded that both meteorological and forage conditions affected the grazing behaviour of yaks and that the general reduction in grazing activities in winter could have been a strategy to reduce exposure to the harsh conditions and, consequently, reduce energy expenditure for foraging and for thermoregulation.

However, accurate quantification of rainfall erosivity remains a challenge due to the limitations of high-precision and long-time series precipitation data. Here, compared with the rainfall erosivity of 291 meteorological stations on the Chinese Loess Plateau, we evaluated the distribution characteristics and accuracy of rainfall erosivity on different temporal and spatial scales calculated by the ERA5 precipitation dataset. A random forest model was constructed to generate a bias dataset to correct the annual rainfall erosivity. Besides, the relationship between erosivity density (ED) and rainfall patterns was quantified to clarify the characteristics of rainfall erosivity. Conducted analysis suggested that the rainfall erosivity calculated from the ERA5 precipitation dataset has high accuracy on average annual, seasonal and monthly scales, and the R2 were 0.62, 0.86, and 0.85, respectively. The addition of the random forest model further optimized the result of average annual rainfall erosivity of ERA5, with root mean square error (RMSE) and absolute value of relative bias (BIAS) decreasing to 185.7 MJ mm ha- 1h- 1 a-1 and 2.17%, respectively. Meanwhile, ERA5 can well capture the average annual rainfall erosivity in different spaces of the study area. The high correlation between erosivity density and rainstorms (R2 = 0.87) indicated that a larger proportion of rainstorms in erosive rainfall will lead to a greater potential risk of soil erosion. These findings provide a reliable approach to accurately obtain the variable rainfall erosivity in areas with complex terrain and sparse stations, and have important implications for soil sustainability.

Methods A pot experiment was performed to grow alfalfa in a loess soil with different doses of P (0, 25, 50, and 100 mg kg(-1)) and OTC (0, 25, 50, and 100 mg kg(-1)). Plant dry mass, shoot and root P concentrations, bulk soil and rhizosheath pH, rhizosheath carboxylates, and bulk soil alkaline phosphatase activity were determined. Results Shoot dry mass and root dry mass increased with increasing P dose, while shoot dry mass decreased with increasing OTC dose, especially at lower P doses (0 and 25 mg kg(-1)). Addition of OTC slightly reduced P concentrations in shoots and roots, but did not reduce plant P content consistently. Increasing OTC dose significantly reduced bulk soil alkaline phosphatase activity at 0P and strongly reduced rhizosheath tartrate amount at all P doses. Conclusions The effects of OTC on plant growth and P uptake depended on both OTC and P doses in soil. High OTC dose had negative effects on shoot P uptake and growth, especially at lower P doses, while it had a positive effect on root growth at higher P doses.

Especially important are 1) decisions about which food security indicators and cut-offs are chosen, and 2) whether analysis focuses on food security status at a given point in time or food security resilience over time. We define resilience as the probability that a household is truly above a chosen food security cut-off, given its underlying assets, demographic characteristics, and past food security status. Our study finds that different factors determine food security status and food security resilience. We also find that the drivers of resilience vary depending on whether food security is measured by Food Consumption Score (FCS) or the reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI). Literacy and livestock holdings are associated with both FCS status and FCS resilience, and the latter is also predicted by access to safe water and sanitation, the dependency ratio, and debt. In contrast, only previous rCSI scores predict current rCSI status, while marital status, literacy, livestock, and other forces matter for determining rCSI resilience. We also find that conclusions about food security resilience are sensitive to the cut-offs chosen to signify a food secure state.

We analyzed the impact of landscape pattern change on ecosystem service value (ESV) of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA). The CA-Markov model was used to map three future (ecological, economic, and eco-economic) scenarios of the TGRA in 2030, then we predicted and compared ESV changes among three scenarios. Our results documented that the total forestland area increased significantly in the ecological scenario, but decreased in the economic scenario. Meanwhile, the construction land area increased in the economic scenario. For the eco-economic scenario, the forestland area change was consistent with the ecological scenario, while the construction land area change was similar to the economic scenario. The ESV of TGRA in 2030 is the highest in the ecological scenario, followed by the eco-economic scenario. Compared to 2015, the total ESV increased in 2030 for both the ecological and eco-economic scenarios, while decreased in the economic scenario. Eco-economic scenario focuses on the coordinated development of ecological protection and economic construction, meeting the needs of economic construction in ecologically fragile areas. This development model will be greatly welcomed by policy makers and effectively promotes sustainable land use in the region. So, we proposed a landscape planning scheme for ecological restoration and economic construction of the TGRA, providing valuable information for decision and policy making and minimizing negative impacts through targeted management measures. Our findings can provide a scientific basis and theoretical practice for environmentally friendly land management.					deng, lei/M-1340-2014														0195-9255	1873-6432				JUL	2022	95								106798	10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106798	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106798		MAY 2022											WOS:000831189500005

Results revealed that rice equivalent yield of intercropping with finger millet+horse grain (7.4 t/ha) was recorded significantly higher compared to finger millet+black grain (6.7 t/ha), rice+black grain (5.55 t/ha), rice+horse gram (5.83 t/ha) and sole rice cropping (1.54 t/ha). Higher gross return ((sic)285441/ha), net return ((sic)217159/ha), B:C ratio (4.18), economic efficiency ((sic)595/ha/day), crop productivity (20.3 kg/ha/day) were recorded with finger millet+horse gram, which was significantly higher as compared to finger millet+black gram, rice+black grain, rice+horse grain and sole rice cropping. Significantly higher land equivalent ratio (2.42) was noted with rice+black gram over rice+horse gram, finger millet+blackgram and finger millet+horse gram. Higher positive aggresivity index (0.22) was recorded with rice+blackgram. Diversified production systems with finger millet+ horse gram had more monetary advantage index ((sic)153100/ha) over finger millet+black gram, rice+black gram and rice+horsegram. Thus, finger millet+horsegram was noted the most productive, resource-use efficient and remunerative cropping system under minted production system of hill and plateau region of eastern India.

These inputs have profoundly affected soil microbial C and N cycles. Changes in the microbial environment are directly caused by changes in soil N and P availability and also indirectly through changes in vegetation in response to increased fertilization. The mechanisms involved in both the direct and indirect changes are not mutually exclusive and are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the responses of vegetation and soil microbes to a 9-year fertilization (N and P) experiment in an alpine grassland in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in China. We found that N addition altered soil microbial community composition and processes regardless of P addition. To maintain stoichiometric homeostasis, soil microbes adjusted metabolic processes in response to changes in nutrient availability. High N availability enhanced microbial investment in C acquisition as indicated by beta-1,4-Glucosidase activity. The abundance of microbial taxa that degrade labile C also increased. High N inputs also induced a proliferation of denitrifiers and increased the gaseous N loss potential. Partial least squares path modelling indicated that soil parameters (e.g., soil organic C and total N) and changes in the plant community played a key role in shaping soil microbial community structure and C and N cycling. Our results suggest that vegetation and stoichiometric differences between resource availability and soil microbial nutrient requirements collectively regulate the responses of soil microbial processes to N enrichment, which provides novel experimental insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of nutrient inputs on microbial C and N cycles. Ultimately, our findings highlight the importance of plant traits in regulating microbial nutrient cycles, further promoting our comprehension about the mechanism of variation in the microbial nutrient cycles in an alpine grassland soils.

Although some recommendations on the optimal spacings exist, they focused on the simulated random fields. We collected surface soil (0-20 cm) samples from 689 sites based on a regular grid of 100 x 100 m in the Liudaogou watershed (6.89 km(2)) on the Loess Plateau, China. We grouped the samples by re-sampling at six sampling spacings (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 m) to determine the characteristic changes in the spatial variability. The mean and CV values varied little among the different spacings (p< 0.05). The sampling spacing can be increased to 300 m if we want to know the possible relationships between OC, TN, and TP with the environmental factors. OC and TN were fitted best by the spherical model whereas TP was fitted best with an exponential model. The optimal model type unchanged as the spacing increased. The apparent parameters of semi-variogram did not differ from their true values when the spacing was less than 200 m for most cases (p< 0.05). Therefore, the spacing should not be greater than 200 m in order to clarify their spatial structures.

Field experiments were conducted in 2009 and 2010 to investigate dynamic zinc (Zn) accumulation and the pre-silking and post-silking Zn uptake and their contributions to grain Zn accumulation of maize with different N supply under field conditions. Results showed that only 1.2% to 39.4% of grain Zn accumulation derived from pre-silking Zn uptake, with Zn remobilization being negatively affected by increasing N supply. However, post-silking Zn uptake (0.8-2.3 mg plant(-1)) and its substantial contribution to grain Zn accumulation (60.6%-98.8%) were progressively enhanced with the increasing N supply. Furthermore, grain Zn concentration was positively associated with grain N concentration (r = 0.752***), post-silking N uptake (r = 0.695***), and post-silking Zn uptake (r = 738***). A significant positive relationship was also found between post-silking uptake of N and Zn (r = 0.775***). These results suggest that N nutrition is a critical factor for shoot Zn uptake and its allocation to maize grain. Dry weight, and N and Zn concentration of grain and straw were significantly enhanced with the increasing N from "no N" to "optimal N" supply (150 kg N ha(-1) in 2009 and 105 kg N ha(-1) in 2010), but further increasing N supply (250 kg N ha(-1)) generally resulted in a nonsignificant increase in both cropping seasons. During the grain development, N supply also generally tended to improve grain N and Zn concentrations, but decrease phosphorus (P) concentration and the molar ratio of P to Zn compared with null N application. These results suggest that grain Zn accumulation mainly originates from post-silking Zn uptake. Applying N at optimal rates ensures better shoot Zn nutrition and contributes to post-silking Zn uptake, maintaining higher grain Zn availability by decreasing the molar ratio of P to Zn, and resulting in benefits to human nutrition.

Although numerous studies have examined the food web response to species loss, their response (e.g. in network topology and interaction frequency) to changes in species abundance has received little attention. We experimentally reduced the abundance (by c. 60%) of one host plant species (Saussurea nigrescens) in a tri-trophic micro-food web consisting of two common Asteraceae species (S. nigrescens and Anaphalis flavescens), their pre-dispersal seed predators (tephritid flies) and the parasitoid wasps that feed on these seed predators. The neutral process hypothesis posits that network topology and interaction frequency are determined by the relative abundances of the participating species. Accordingly, we hypothesized that interaction frequency (indicated by the rate of flies infesting plants and of parasitoid wasps parasitizing flies) would decrease with decreasing abundance of host plant abundance. Consistent with the neutral process hypothesis, abundance reduction significantly decreased the rate of generalist flies infesting the manipulated plant host species, but increased the rate on unmanipulated plant species. In contrast, abundance reduction significantly increased the rate of specialist flies infesting the manipulated species, but it had no demonstrable effect on the specialists on the unmanipulated plant host. Moreover, abundance reduction significantly increased the rate of parasitoid wasps (as a species group) parasitizing flies in the manipulated species, but decreased the rate of the unmanipulated species. These results were not attributable to neutral processes, but can be explained by adaptive foraging theory. In addition, experimental manipulation did not shift the qualitative presence-absence of the linkages in the micro-food web, and the change in the abundance of both fly and wasp species was smaller than the abundance changes of the manipulated plant species. Synthesis. Our results indicate that both neutral processes and/or adaptive foraging likely contributed to food web stability in responses to changes in species abundance. Because species abundance is vulnerable to abiotic and biotic environmental changes, we suggest more research should be conducted to understand how food webs respond to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance.

Compositional and phylogenetic nestedness of host assemblages exploited by generalist ectoparasites across their geographic ranges: drivers and associations with ectoparasite traits	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												We investigated compositional and phylogenetic nestedness in the host assemblages of 26 host-generalist fleas across regions within the Palearctic. We asked the following questions: (i) are host assemblages exploited by a flea species compositionally or phylogenetically nested (=C-nested and P-nested, respectively) across regions?; (ii) if yes, what are the processes that generate nestedness, and does phy-logenetic nestedness follow the same processes as compositional nestedness?; and (iii) are the biological traits of a flea species associated with its host assemblages' degree of nestedness? Nestedness was calcu-lated for matrices with rows ordered either by decreasing region area (=a-matrices) or increasing distance from the centre of a flea's geographic range (d-matrices). Significant C-nestedness was found in either a-(three fleas) or d-matrices (three fleas) or both (10 fleas). Significant P-nestedness was detected in either a-(three fleas) or d-matrices (four fleas) or both (two fleas). In some but not other species, P-nestedness followed C-nestedness. The probability of C-nestedness to be significant, as well as its degree for d-matrices, was associated with a flea's morphoecological traits, whereas this was not the case for either a-matrices or the P-nestedness for either type of ordered matrices. We conclude that compositional, but not phylogenetic, nestedness is (i) generated by similar mechanisms in many flea species and (ii) may be simultaneously driven by different mechanisms in the same flea. In contrast, mechanisms pro-moting phylogenetic nestedness differ between flea species and seem to act separately.(c) 2023 Australian Society for Parasitology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effects of global change factors vary based on the climate gradient. Here, we established a global database of leaf traits from 192 experiments on elevated CO2 concentrations (eCO2), drought, N deposition, and warming. The results showed that the leaf mass per area (LMA) significantly increased under eCO2 and drought conditions but decreased with N deposition, whereas eCO2 levels and drought conditions reduced stomatal conductance and increased and decreased photosynthetic rates, respectively. Leaf dark respiration (Rd) increased in response to global change, excluding N deposition. Leaf N concentrations declined with eCO2 but increased with N deposition. Leaf area increased with eCO2, N deposition, and warming but decreased with drought. Leaf thickness increased with eCO2 but decreased with warming. eCO2 and N deposition enhanced plant water-use efficiency (WUE), eCO2 and warming increased photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE), while N fertilization reduced PNUE significantly. eCO2 produced a positive relationship between WUE and PNUE, which were limited under drought but increased in areas with high humidity and high temperature. Trade-offs were observed between WUE and PNUE under drought, N deposition, and warming. These findings suggest that the effects of global change factors on plants can be altered by complex environmental changes; moreover, diverse plant water and nutrient strategy responses can be interpreted against the background of their functional traits.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 10	2023	898								165572	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165572		JUL 2023						37454860					WOS:001046906800001

Genetically-determined variations in photosynthesis indicate roles for specific fatty acid species in chilling responses	PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT												Using a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) cowpea (Vigna unguiculata. L. Walp), we tested for co-linkages between lipid contents and chilling responses of photosynthesis. Under low-temperature conditions (19 degrees C/13 degrees C, day/night), we observed co-linkages between quantitative trait loci intervals for photosynthetic light reactions and specific fatty acids, most strikingly, the thylakoid-specific fatty acid 16:1(Delta 3trans) found exclusively in phosphatidylglycerol (PG 16:1t). By contrast, we did not observe co-associations with bulk polyunsaturated fatty acids or highmelting-point-PG (sum of PG 16:0, PG 18:0 and PG 16:1t) previously thought to be involved in chilling sensitivity. These results suggest that in cowpea, chilling sensitivity is modulated by specific lipid interactions rather than bulk properties. We were able to recapitulate the predicted impact of PG 16:1t levels on photosynthetic responses at low temperature using mutants and transgenic Arabidopsis lines. Because PG 16:1t synthesis requires the activity of peroxiredoxin-Q, which is activated by H2O2 and known to be involved in redox signalling, we hypothesise that the accumulation of PG 16:1t occurs as a result of upstream effects on photosynthesis that alter redox status and production of reactive oxygen species.

Here, we investigated how the microbial characteristics of a Pinus tabulaeformis plantation responded to different management practices to identify the role of microbial characteristics in influencing the stability of soil organic carbon (SOC). We chose a Pinus tabulaeformis plantation on the Loess Plateau where forest management practices had been conducted since 1999. Five forest management practices were implemented: two at the forest level (P. tabulaeformis with and without ground litter), and three using different vegetation restoration approaches after dear-cutting (P. tabulaeformis seedlings, abandoned grassland, and natural shrub regeneration). Microbial biomass, soil respiration, microbial community structure, microbial metabolic function, and soil oxidizable organic carbon (OC) fractions were evaluated. Forest management practices changed SOC stability by adjusting the microbial characteristics (e.g. soil microbial community diversity and microbial metabolic function diversity). The result of path analysis was that the direct path coefficient of microbial biomass on soil oxidizable OC fractions was the largest, which was 1,499. Path analysis and redundancy analysis showed that microbial biomass had the largest direct influence on soil oxidizable OC fractions. Compared with other forest management practices, natural shrub regeneration increased the nonlabile carbon fraction by increasing soil microbial characteristics, and contributed the most towards stabilizing SOC, which enhanced the stability of the soil ecosystem on the plateau. In conclusion, microbial biomass was the biggest influence factor of SOC stability. In contrast, the stability of SOC may be most stable in the area of natural shrub regeneration.

The interaction effects of plantation age and climate gradient on SOC and STN changes following afforestation are not well understood. In this study, five sites were selected along a precipitation gradient (410-600 mm yr(-1)) in the Loess Plateau. The SOC and STN stocks at a depth of 0-200 cm were measured in cropland and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) forests with different plantation ages, that is, young forest (<15 years), middle-aged forest (15-25 years), and old forest (>25 years). The SOC and STN stocks in the 0- to 200-cm profiles of young forest, middle-aged forest, and cropland increased significantly with mean annual precipitation (p < .05), whereas the increasing trend of the SOC stocks of old forest was not significant, indicating an age-dependent change in the SOC and STN stocks across the precipitation gradient. The SOC stock change ( increment SOC) following afforestation increased with mean annual precipitation in young forest, but it had a decreasing trend in middle-aged and old forests. The STN stock changes ( increment STN) in the three forests were negative at most sites, and they all decreased along the precipitation gradient. There were significant positive correlations between increment SOC and increment STN (p < .01), and 1-g STN stock accumulation was accompanied by 8.40-, 6.10-, and 10.48-g SOC accumulation for young forest, middle-aged forest, and old forest, respectively. The different patterns of SOC and STN stock changes should be incorporated into soil C and N modelling and estimation.

However, unclear understanding of rational crop rotation and the lack of global quantitative assessment limit our deeper insight into soil nutrient cycling under conservation agriculture. Considering the important role of soil extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) on soil nutrient cycling, a meta-analysis with 3238 observations was conducted on the effects of no tillage (NT) and legumes incorporation into rotation system (LRS) on soil EEAs. NT significantly increased the activities of C-acquiring, N-acquiring, P-acquiring, and oxidative enzymes by 18.3%, 17.4%, 7.1%, and 14.0%, respectively, while LRS significantly increased only P-acquiring enzymes. The combination of NT and legume cultivation had no significant effect on EEAs. In contrast, crop diversity had a positive effect on the NT-induced increase in EEAs. In addition, the extent of NT-induced changes varied depending on other factors. Through further analysis, we clarified the important factors affecting NT-induced changes in EEAs, such as climatic conditions, soil properties, and agronomic practices at the experimental sites. Overall, our findings provide insights into the understanding of the mechanisms of conservation agriculture impacts on the soil nutrient cycling.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				JAN	2024	235								105870	10.1016/j.still.2023.105870	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2023.105870		SEP 2023											WOS:001118642400001

Sexually selected traits, such as sexual signals that contribute to reproductive isolation, were thought to promote diversification. However, studies exploring links between sexually selected traits and species diversification have thus far primarily focused on visual or acoustic signals. Many animals often employ chemical signals (i.e., pheromones) for sexual communications, but large-scale analyses on the role of chemical communications in driving species diversification have been missing. Here, for the first time, we investigate whether traits associated with chemical communications-the presence of follicular epidermal glands-promote diversification across 6,672 lizard species. In most analyses, we found no strong association between the presence of follicular epidermal glands and species diversification rates, either across all lizard species or at lower phylogenetic scales. Previous studies suggest that follicular gland secretions act as species recognition signals that prevent hybridization during speciation in lizards. However, we show that geographic range overlap was no different in sibling species pairs with and without follicular epidermal glands. Together, these results imply that either follicular epidermal glands do not primarily function in sexual communications or sexually selected traits in general (here chemical communication) have a limited effect on species diversification. In our additional analysis accounting for sex-specific differences in glands, we again found no detectable effect of follicular epidermal glands on species diversification rates. Thus, our study challenges the general role of sexually selected traits in broad-scale species diversification patterns.

Successful symbiosis is regulated by signals from both legume hosts and their rhizobial partners. HmuS is a heme degrading factor widely distributed in bacteria, but little is known about the role of rhizobial hmuS in symbiosis with legumes. Here, we found that inactivation of hmuS(pSym) in the symbiotic plasmid of Mesorhizobium amorphae CCNWGS0123 disrupted rhizobial infection, primordium formation, and nitrogen fixation in symbiosis with Robinia pseudoacacia. Although there was no difference in bacteroids differentiation, infected plant cells were shrunken and bacteroids were disintegrated in nodules of plants infected by the Delta hmuS(pSym) mutant strain. The balance of defence reaction was also impaired in Delta hmuS(pSym) strain-infected root nodules. hmuS(pSym) was strongly expressed in the nitrogen-fixation zone of mature nodules. Furthermore, the HmuS(pSym) protein could bind to heme but not degrade it. Inactivation of hmuS(pSym) led to significantly decreased expression levels of oxygen-sensing related genes in nodules. In summary, hmuS(pSym) of M. amorphae CCNWGS0123 plays an essential role in nodule development and maintenance of bacteroid survival within R. pseudoacacia cells, possibly through heme-binding in symbiosis.

However, high potato yield depends on a large amount of irrigation that raises a series of environment problems. Assessing the water-saving potential across China's potato planting regions is of importance for maintaining sustainable development of potato production. In this study, we firstly evaluated the potential yields, rainfed yields, and their gaps of potato across different potato planting regions, and then presented optimal agronomic management options (planting date, cultivar maturity, and irrigation schedule) by considering both yield and water use efficiency of potato under the limitation of available water resources with validated APSIM-Potato model. Along the distribution of growth period solar radiation, potential yield of potato was highest in the North Single planting region (NS), followed by the Central Double planting region (CD), Southwest Mixed planting region (SWM), and South Winter planting region (SW). However, rainfed yield of potato was highest in CD followed by NS, SW, and SWM along the distribution of the reproductive growth period precipitation. Under the limitation of available water resources, most potato planting regions should select middle-late maturing cultivars while optimal planting dates varied among regions with earlier planting in north China and later planting in south China compared with normal planting date. Based on the optimization of planting date, cultivar maturity, and irrigation schedule, there is a large water-saving potential in China's potato planting regions. Average irrigation amount could be decreased by 66% in SW, 49% in SWM, 40% in NS, and 29% in CD, respectively, relative to irrigation quota. Our study suggests that optimizing planting date, cultivar maturity, and irrigation management could realize win-win of yield and water use efficiency and provide a scientific support for water-saving irrigation of potato production in China.					wang, ya/HQZ-7558-2023; Wang, Jing/AFK-1683-2022; Wang, Yu/GZL-9655-2022; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009; Liu, Jie/JCP-1070-2023; Wu, Yiping/JJF-6185-2023; Wang, Yixuan/GZK-6559-2022; Zhang, Yanchao/JMB-7717-2023; Wang, Yiru/JMB-2281-2023; yuan, lin/JDW-7387-2023; Wang, Yin/HCI-9352-2022; Wang, Yiping/IZQ-2052-2023; wang, yiran/IAP-0414-2023; wang, yixuan/GXW-2866-2022; Wang, Yijun/GXW-1763-2022; Zhao, Gang/JMC-6248-2023; wang, yi/GVT-8516-2022; wang, yixuan/JGM-3893-2023; wang, yi/HOF-6668-2023; Wang, yanru/JAX-5241-2023	Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Wu, Yiping/0009-0000-6223-5786; 													1161-0301	1873-7331				MAR	2022	134								126450	10.1016/j.eja.2021.126450	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2021.126450		JAN 2022											WOS:000743025100002

Chlorophyll content and fluorescence, leaf temperature, and stomatal conductance were evaluated at 12 h, 36 h, 60 h, and 84 h after herbicides application. U46 Combi Fluid, Cruz, and MR did not have a significant effect on chlorophyll fluorescence induction curves as compared to the control treatment. However, Basagran, Bromicide, Lumax, and Gramoxone showed significant changes in the shape of polyphasic fluorescence transients (OJIP transients). Variations in chlorophyll content index, leaf temperature, and stomatal conductance parameters were dependent on the type of applied herbicide. Our study revealed that the specific impact of the applied herbicides on the photosynthetic efficiency of plants is related to their chemical groups and their mechanism of action.					porheidar, soheila/ABA-7128-2020; rastogi, Anshu/F-3003-2013; Kalaji, Mohamed Hazem/E-8086-2012; Oukarroum, Abdallah/AAW-2558-2021	porheidar, soheila/0000-0003-0789-2534; rastogi, Anshu/0000-0002-0953-7045; Kalaji, Mohamed Hazem/0000-0002-3833-4917; Oukarroum, Abdallah/0000-0002-1942-5610														2223-7747				APR	2020	9	4							529	10.3390/plants9040529	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants9040529								32325997					WOS:000539578900123

To evaluate flow resistance relations and sediment transport for landscape vegetation coverage and combinate effect of vegetation patches, field simulated rainfall experiments were conducted using a series of overland runoff and sediment transport rates in 3 m (L) x 2 m (W) experimental plots with coverages of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 90% in a uniformly distributed condition and composited flow paths of different patches (horizonal path, vertical path, random patches and S-shaped path) in the same coverage (40% and 60%). The runoff rates for the grassland with coverages of 20-90% were decreased by 19.3-61.4% (P < 0.05), and the sediment concentrations were reduced by 81.7-97.8% (P < 0.05) compared to the bare land. The Darcy-Weisbach resistance coefficient doubled and the stream power declined by 60.0% when grassland coverage increases to 90%. The runoff rates varied little among the conditions of horizontal, vertical, random and S-shaped flow paths at the coverage of 60%, while the rate apparently reduced by 34.1% (P < 0.05) when the vertical flow path became horizontal under the same coverage of 40%. The sediments for poorly connected flow paths could reduce sediment > 90% either on high-coverage or low-coverage grassland. Our field experiments confirmed that the increase of vegetation coverage and the combination of landscape patches could significantly reduce runoff rates, sediment yields and flow velocities, increase surface roughness, promote flow resistance and diminish hydraulic shear stress and the stream power. The poorly-connected paths (horizontal and random) exhibited a stronger flow resistance and weaker sediment transport capacity than the well-connected paths (vertical and S-shaped).

However, the impact of crop rotational regimes on the soil phosphorus (P) fractions and associated phosphorus cycling (P-cycling) profiles driven by microbial communities are not well elucidated. Hence, we used metagenomics to comprehensively investigate the variations in soil microbial P-cycling functional genes and representative processes, as well their regulations for soil P fractions among distinct crop rotational regimes and complexity. Most soil properties, particularly P fractions, were significantly greater in corn rotations than other crop rotations. The composition of P-cycling functional genes and microbial communities was also distinctly clustered in accordance with crop rotational regimes to varying degrees. The potential of representative P-cycling processes was all significantly higher in the complex rotation. Notably, the key functional genes including phoD, ppx, pstB, ugpA were differently screened from each P-cycling process and assembled toward the middle of their networks. Furthermore, soil potential carbon mineralization as a dominant property regulated several P-cycling processes and was intimately associated with the key P-cycling functional genes. Crop rotational complexity and the P-uptake and transport process had profoundly total effects on soil P fractions. Overall, this study provides a deep insight into soil microbial P-cycling functional profiles for developing sustainable soil P management practices at crop rotational agroecosystems.																			0167-1987	1879-3444				SEP	2023	233								105809	10.1016/j.still.2023.105809	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2023.105809		JUN 2023											WOS:001036464800001

Natural forests account for 71% of China's forested area, but their carbon stocks and sequestration potentials remain unclear. Here, we compiled data from 762 natural forest sites across China and found that natural forests had a carbon stock of 9.40 +/- 1.45 Pg C in 2010. When naturally regenerated to the over-mature stage, existing natural forests can additionally sequestrate 8.67 +/- 6.93 Pg C in the next two centuries, accounting for 48% of the carbon carrying capacity of the natural forest ecosystem in China, i.e. 18.07 +/- 6.78 Pg C. Future carbon sequestration potential in natural forests is dominated by the tree layer at 6.88 +/- 6.87 Pg, followed by the shrub layer at 1.02 +/- 0.55 Pg, floor layer at 0.72 +/- 0.74 Pg and herb layer at 0.05 +/- 0.10 Pg. The natural forests are expected to achieve 70% of their future carbon sequestration potential by 2100. We also note that assisted regeneration via tree planting can play a significant role in natural forest restoration, as the carbon densities of natural and planted forests are rarely significantly different at the same age under 60 years old. Therefore, the preservation and expansion of natural forests is the key strategy for achieving long-term carbon sequestration.

Information on pregnancy outcomes and management risk factors were collected for 299 goat and 242 sheep flocks. Blood samples were collected from 133 sheep and 90 goat flocks and tested for Coxiella burnetii, Brucella spp., Chlamydia abortus, and Toxoplasma gondii. A causal diagram outlined relationships between potential predictor variables and abortion in the flock. The effect of management and exposure to infectious causes on the number of abortions in the flock across agroecology was tested using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Results showed that 142 (58.68%) goats and 53 (17.73%) sheep flocks reported abortions in the 12 months before the survey. The mean annual flock abortion percentages were 16.1% (+/- 26.23) for does and 12.6% (+/- 23.5) for ewes. Farmers perceived infectious diseases, extreme weather conditions, feed shortage, physical traumas, and plant poisoning as the most important causes of abortion. A higher proportion of abortion was recorded during the short rainy season (March to May) and start of the short dry and cold season (June to August) in the lowland mixed crop-livestock and pastoral agroecology and production system, respectively. Overall, 65.41% sheep and 92.22% goat flocks tested positive for one or more abortion causing agents, namely, C. burnetti, C. abortus, Brucella spp., and T. gondii; mixed infection was found in 31.58% sheep and 63.33% goat flocks. Spending the night in a traditional house and providing supplementary feed for pregnant dams were important management factors which significantly (p <= 0.05) decreased the risk of abortion by 2.63 and 4.55 times, respectively. However, the presence of other livestock species and dogs in the household and exposure of the flock to Brucella spp. or anyone of the four tested infectious agents significantly (p <= 0.05) increased the risk of abortion in sheep and goat flocks. In general, abortion is a challenge for small ruminant production in the study area especially in lowland agroecology and calls for improvement in husbandry practices, health care and biosecurity practices.

The changes in LULC were analyzed by integrating field observations, remote-sensing data (aerial photographs [1: 50,000 scale] and very high resolution [0.5-3.2 m] satellite images), and geographic information systems. The drivers of LULC were explored using key informant interviews and relevant literature reviews. The implications of LULC change on soil erosion and surface runoff responses were also evaluated. A minimum of four and maximum of six LULC classes were identified in each watershed over the study period. The study revealed that forest land was the dominant LULC class accounting for 40.9% and 32.0% in Guder and Aba Gerima, respectively in 1982. While in the same period, bush land (36.6%) was the dominant LULC class in Debatie watershed. From 1982 to 2016/2017, forest land, bush land, and grazing land respectively decreased by about 70%, 50%, and 27% in Guder; 65%, 49%, and 63% in Aba Gerima; and 63%, 59%, and 38% in Debatie. During the same period, cultivated land increased by approximately 40%, 129%, and 704% in Guder, Aba Gerima and Debatie, respectively. In contrast, between 2012 and 2017, plantation cover increased by about 400% in the Guder, mainly at the expense of cultivated land, which decreased by 40% for the same period. Population growth and associated changes in the farming practices were the major driving forces for the observed LULC changes in the study watersheds. The traditionally deleterious impacts of human activities on the environment have been recently reversed at an unprecedented rate, particularly at Guder and to a lesser extent at Aba Gerima, following the shift from the traditional annual cropping to more economically attractive tree-based farming practices such as Acacia decurrens plantation in Guder and khat (Cathy edulis) cultivation in Aba Gerima. The continued expansion of cultivated land combined with population growth positively linked to the increase of gully erosion and surface runoff potential in the study watersheds particularly, in Aba Gerima and Debatie watersheds. The Upper Blue Nile basin is currently experiencing both positive and negative socio-economic and environmental consequences of LULC dynamics. Hence, the present study can help form a basis for the appropriate development of land management policies and strategies in this and other basins experiencing similar problems.

This study gives an overview of the existing algorithms for flow accumulation calculations for single-flow direction matrices. A fast and simple algorithm for calculating flow accumulation matrices is proposed in this study. The algorithm identifies three types of cells in a flow direction matrix: source cells, intersection cells, and interior cells. It traverses all source cells and traces the downstream interior cells of each source cell until an intersection cell is encountered. An intersection cell is treated as an interior cell when its last drainage path is traced and the tracing continues with its downstream cells. Experiments are conducted on thirty datasets with a resolution of 3 m. Compared with the existing algorithms for flow accumulation calculation, the proposed algorithm is easy to implement, runs much faster than existing algorithms, and generally requires less memory space.																			2095-0195	2095-0209				JUN	2019	13	2					317	326		10.1007/s11707-018-0725-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-018-0725-9													WOS:000468328700006

Accurately calculating the sediment transport capacity is key to the construction of soil erosion process models. Research on Tc has focused mainly on the dynamics of a single particle of sediment and hydraulic variables. There have been few studies of the impact of soil aggregates on the Tc. To clarify how sediment characteristics, including those for single particles and aggregates, affect the Tc of overland flow with no raindrop import, flume experiments were implemented at slope gradients varying from 5.24% to 26.80% and flow discharges ranging from 0.68 to 5.41 x 10-3 m2 s-1. The experimental materials were five typical soils in China. The results indicated that the correlation between the measured Tc and sediment mechanical composition indexes of the five soils was indistinctive in this study. The sediment settling velocity with aggregates has a significant corre-lation with the measured Tc. New equations, including for the sediment settling velocity with aggregates uud75, were established to calculate the Tc. The empirical equation that included uud75, slope gradient and unit discharge performed greatly in predicting Tc (R2 = 0.93, NSE = 0.90). uud75 can effectively improve the calculation accuracy of Tc. The new equation including flow and sediment properties obtained through dimensional analysis performed well in predicting Tc (R2 = 0.99, NSE = 0.91), and the calculation accuracy was better than that of the empirical model derived in this study. These findings indicate that the sediment settling velocity is an important variable in the equation for predicting sediment transport capacity of overland flow.

Six treatments were employed in which additives were applied to alfalfa on a fresh weight basis: CK (no additive), FA (0.6% formic acid), CaO (3% calcium oxide and 3% urea), LB (1 x 10(6) cfu/g Lentilactobacillus buchneri), GLB (2% glucose and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g L. buchneri), and FLB (2% fucoidan and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g L. buchneri). After 60 days of ensiling, all treatments altered the bacterial communities, improved the fermentation quality, reduced dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) losses, and enhanced the rumen degradation of nutrients. The addition of LB increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. (p < 0.05), whereas GLB reduced (p < 0.05) the NH3-N:TN ratio and elevated (p < 0.05) the concentrations of Lactobacillus and lactic acid content. The FA treatment reduced (p < 0.05) the pH, as well as the DM and CP degradations, while the CaO treatment increased the degradations of DM, acid detergent fiber, and neutral detergent fiber. We concluded that FA, LB, GLB, and FLB had beneficial effects on alfalfa fermentation, and that CaO increased alfalfa silage rumen degradation.					xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; Wang, Jiacheng/ABE-5948-2020	Degen, Allan/0000-0003-4563-6195														2311-5637				NOV	2022	8	11							660	10.3390/fermentation8110660	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fermentation8110660													WOS:000894771200001

Restoring soil carbon in marginal land of Indian Himalayas: Impact of crop intensification and conservation tillage	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Soil carbon (C) loss is the prime sign of land degradation, and C pools have a great impact on soil quality and climate change mitigation. Hence, a field experiment was conducted for three consecutive years to assess the impact of crop intensification and conservation tillage practices on changes in the C pool at different soil depths of marginal land of the Indian Himalayas. The experiment consisted of two intensified cropping systems viz., CS1-Summer maize (Zea mays L.) -rainy season maize-lentil (Lens esculenta L.) and CS2-Summer maize-rainy season maize-mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern) and five tillage practices viz., No-till (NT); NT + live mulch of cowpea (NT + LMC); reduced tillage (RT); RT + LMC and conventional tillage (CT). Results revealed that CS2 produced significantly higher biomass, C retention efficiency (9.85%), and sequestrated greater C (0.42 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) in the soil system than CS1. Of the various tillage practices, RT + LMC registered higher biomass and recycled greater biomass and C than those under other tillage practices. However, the highest soil organic carbon (SOC) content (7.03 g kg( -1)) and pool (9.62 Mg ha( -1)) in 0-10 cm depth were observed under NT + LMC. The non-labile C pool size under NT in 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depths was significantly greater than those under CT. The NT + LMC sequestrated significantly higher SOC (0.57 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) than other tillage practices. Thus, the study indicated that the adoption of an intensified maize-based system under RT + LMC or NT + LMC would increase SOC storage and C sequestration in marginal lands of the Indian Himalayas.

This study aims at developing a model to predict noise in a largely informal urban Kano, the second most populated city in Nigeria. Sound level meter (SLM) 200 TL was used to measure noise at locations covering different land use: residential, industrial, commercial, educational, and administrative areas. Data were collected for seven days, and each day measurements were taken for six hours: 8-10 a.m., 12-2 p.m. and 4-6 p.m. Land use, population density, residential division, traffic volume, and land cover were used to generate a noise model using weighted geographic regression. The findings revealed that noise in the area is higher than the permissible limits set by the WHO and Nigeria's regulatory agency. The model identified population density as the most influencing factor, followed by land cover, traffic volume and distance to the road, then land use. Seventy three percent of the model's residual are below five, indicating a significant association between noise and the variables used. The R-2 ranges between 18% and 26% depending on the time of the day. Noise in the area can be effectively control by paying serious attention to city planning and enforcing traffic regulation measures.

A family of alpha/beta-hydrolases have been proposed to be the SL receptor proteins. Effective assays for measuring the activity of SL receptors could promote the development of SL-related biology and chemistry. In this study, we developed a new approach called pharmacophore-linked probe virtual screening (PPVS). Its application yielded an effective "off-on" probe named Xilatone Red (XLR). This probe showed a broad spectrum and excellent sensitivity toward SL receptors, including ShD14 (Striga D14), for which the detection limit was determined to be in the micromolar range, outperforming that of the commercial fluorogenic agonist Yoshimulactone Green (YLG). Upon hydrolysis by SL receptors, XLR provided fluorogenic and colorimetric signaling responses. Furthermore, XLR could induce germination of Phelipanche aegyptiaca seeds and prevent Arabidopsis max4-1 branching defects at micromolar concentrations. Our molecular simulations revealed the essential factors in the molecular perception of XLR. We anticipate that this study can prompt the discovery of high-performance SL agonists/antagonists to combat parasitic weeds.

Therefore, the relationship between delta O-18 in precipitation (delta O-18(PPT)) and the affecting factors need to be thoroughly understood. We present a model considering the combined effects of temperature, altitude, and latitude on the spatial variability of annual average of stable isotopes in precipitation across China. This new model performed significantly better (P<0.05) than the widely used Farquhar and Bowen & Wilkinson models. Our model allows modelling the spatial distribution of isotopes in precipitation depending on temperature variation. The residuals of presented model did not significantly correlate with altitude. Based on the model and residuals, a high-resolution map of annual average delta O-18(ppt) across China was generated. delta O-18(ppt) decreased from low toward high latitudes and from low towards high altitudes area. The model application provides important information for ancient climate, hydrological cycle and water vapor sources studies.

The aim of this paper was to quantify the effect of changes in vegetation coverage on soil erosion control in the red soil hilly region of China. Based on a literature review, a database was collected from 35 typical small watersheds. The database covered extensive geographical locations, including 6 provinces and 1 autonomous region of China, with vegetation coverage ranging from 8% to 96%, and the soil erosion modulus ranging from 67 to 13,000 t.km(-2).a(-1). The results confirmed that vegetation coverage significantly and positively affected soil loss. It also indicated that there is a threshold phenomenon between vegetation coverage and soil loss. The vegetation coverage in the small watersheds could be divided into three threshold zones: the lower threshold (0-40%), the transition zone (40-80%), and the upper threshold (80-100%). In these zones, the vegetation soil conservation efficiency and its changing rates were unlike. Thus, different vegetation restoration strategies should be adopted in these zones. In the lower threshold, it is suitable to adopt artificial restoration; in the upper threshold, natural recovery is more reasonable; and in the transition zone, combination of artificial and natural restoration is preferable. This study revealed the vegetation coverage threshold values and the corresponding restoration strategies with respect to soil erosion control at the region scale, which serve as a scientific basis for decision makers.

Here, we used a simplified raster remote sensing model based on MODIS data across South Africa for five different time slices for the period 2001-2019. The aims of the study were to quantify the economic changes in ecosystem services due to land degradation and land-cover changes based on areal values (in USD ha(-1) yr(-1)) for ecosystem services reported in the literature. Results show progressive and systematic changes in land-cover classes across different regions of South Africa for the time period of analysis, which are attributed to climate change. Total ecosystem service values for South Africa change somewhat over time as a result of land-use change, but for 2019 this calculated value is USD 437 billion, which is ~125% of GDP. This is the first estimation of ecosystem service value made for South Africa at the national scale. In detail, changes in land cover over time within each of the nine constituent provinces in South Africa mean that ecosystem service values also change regionally. There is a clear disparity between the provinces with the greatest ecosystem service values when compared to their populations and contribution to GDP. This highlights the potential for untapped ecosystem services to be exploited as a tool for regional sustainable development.</p>					Elbasit, Mohamed A. M.

J	Ye, JZ; Yue, C; Hu, YF; Ma, H				Ye, Junzhi; Yue, Chao; Hu, Yunfeng; Ma, Hui			Spatial patterns of global-scale forest root-shoot ratio and their controlling factors	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The forest root-shoot ratio (R/S), i.e., the ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass at the stand level, is widely used in global and regional forest carbon stock estimation and in modeling of the forest carbon cycle. Despite recent advances in understanding forest R/S variations at the individual-tree level, spatial patterns of standlevel forest R/S ratio across the globe and their driving factors remain relatively unknown. Here, we compiled and analyzed an extensive dataset from 873 forest sites worldwide, analyzed and quantified the effects of major environmental and forest growth-related variables on the stand-level R/S ratio. Based on this analysis, we further mapped the spatial pattern of the global forest R/S ratio. Our results show that, globally, variations on the stand-level forest R/S ratio are largely affected by canopy height, latitude, climatic water deficit, forest type and regeneration method, which collectively explain 37% of the variations in R/S ratio. In addition, our results suggest significant intercontinental and national variations in forest R/S ratio. At the continental scale, forest R/S ratio is highest in Oceania and lowest in South America. At the national scale, Australia has the highest forest R/S ratio while Russia has the lowest values. The forest R/S ratio is generally lower in moist tropical regions, but increases when moving to the extra-tropics when seasonality in precipitation increases. The R/S ratio in temperate and boreal regions shows prominent spatial features regulated by forest species composition and regeneration method. We conclude that future changes in environmental, biotic and anthropogenic factors, such as increased climatic water deficit and forest management, might influence the forest R/S ratio, with implications for the global and regional land carbon cycle.

Surface cover is an important factor that affects Tc; investigation into the potential effect of litter cover on Tc is limited. The objectives of this study were to quantify the effects of Pinus tabulaeformis litter cover on Tc; to explore various relationships between hydraulic variables, litter cover, and Tc; and to compare the similarities and differences of the effect of litter and stem cover on Tc. Experiments were conducted in a 5 x 0.38 m flume. The unit flow discharge varied from 1.316 x 10(-3) to 3.947 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1), and the slope gradient varied from 8.8 to 26.8 %. Pine needles of Pinus tabulaeformis were selected to simulate litter cover. Seven levels of litter cover were considered: 0%, 5%, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 50 %, and 70 %. The median diameter of the test sediment was 0.35 mm. The results showed that Tc decreased exponentially as litter cover increased. Measured Tc could be predicted adequately (R-2 = 0.96) by unit flow discharge, slope gradient and litter cover, or the stream power and litter cover. Flow velocity or unit stream power could predict the Tc equally well (R-2 = 0.95) without including the cover term because the effect of litter cover on the Tc manifests itself in the increased resistance and reduced flow velocity. Tc is most sensitive to the slope gradient when the level of cover is low. The effect of litter cover on Tc could be greater than the unit flow discharge and slope gradient in relative terms when the level of cover exceeded 38 % and 81 %, respectively. The effect of stem cover on Tc is greater than that of litter cover, other variables being the same.

Soil carbon sequestration potential in a Vertisol in central India- results from a 43-year long-term experiment and APSIM modeling	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												Soil organic matter dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems are controlled by complex interactions between various factors such as climate, soil, and agricultural management practices. We utilized a process-based crop model, APSIM, to simulate long-term soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics for a soybean-wheat cropping system under nitrogen (N) and farmyard manure management (FYM) practices for a 43-year old experimental dataset in India. The APSIM was parameterized and validated to predict grain yield and SOC stock. The validated model was then used to evaluate the impacts of different management practices on SOC dynamics in the top 30 cm of soil through scenario modeling. The results of the APSIM simulations demonstrated that improved N and FYM management practices had great potential to increase SOC sequestration in these Vertisols. The equilibrium SOC concentration under different N management practices increased with a higher N application rate, with the integrated application of N with FYM showing the maximum rate. The optimum N (N-opt) rate for maximum SOC sequestration was estimated to be 155 kg ha(-1) for wheat in the studied Vertisol and the time to reach steady-state of the site was 104 years. The N-opt increased SOC by about 28.6% over the initial concentration. We found that the APSIM was robust in predicting long-term changes in SOC stock (Index of agreement = 0.79 and root mean square error = 3.33 Mg ha(-1), R-2 = 0.92, mean bias error = - 1.08) for a Vertisol soil of central India, in this case under a soybean-wheat cropping system. The study results highlighted that balanced fertilization is the key to sustaining SOC stock in the long-term for Vertisols.

Calcium (Ca) is an essential element and participates in various physiological responses to environmental stress. Here, the aim of this work was to study the role of exogenous Ca in alleviating Al toxicity in Arabidopsis thaliana. For that we used the methods of physiology and proteomics. Results showed that Ca alleviated Al-induced growth inhibition and decreased Al accumulation. Proteomic analyses showed that 75 differentially expressed protein spots, including those related to organic acid metabolism, cell wall components, cellular transport, signal transduction and antioxidant activity, transcription and protein metabolism were identified during the response of Arabidopsis to Ca alleviated Al toxicity. Ca regulated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-related protein abundances and affected organic acid concentrations and related enzyme activities under Al stress. Vacuolar and mitochondrion adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, and cell wall component-related proteins played important roles in Ca-alleviated Al toxicity. Ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3) participated in Ca-alleviated Al toxicity. Glutathione S-transferase (GST6) and glutathione S-transferase tau 19 (ATGSTU19) were associated with antioxidant activities induced by Ca under Al stress. Our results may contribute to an understanding of the functional mechanism by which Ca alleviates Al stress in plants. Significant Our results elucidated how Ca alleviate the effects of Al toxicity on the inhibition of plant growth and Al accumulation in plants using the proteomics and physiological methods, which may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of Ca alleviation Al stress in plants.

However, how the soil properties influence infiltration after farmland conversions remain unclear in the semiarid areas. This study used a double-ring infiltrometer to conduct infiltration experiments in soil surface and subsurface among land-uses on the Loess Plateau, to explore the mechanism of soil physicochemical properties and crusts on infiltration. The results showed that the revegetation lands effectively improved infiltration properties, while no significant differences were observed between the orchards and the farmlands. The loose soil structure, stable aggregates, higher organic matter and root mass density improved while soil crusts impeded infiltration capacity after farmland conversions. The impeding effect of the biocrusts presented throughout the infiltration process while physical crusts impeded infiltration only at the initial stage. Soil physical properties (i.e., bulk density, porosity, macroaggregate, texture, moisture), biochemical properties (i.e., soil organic matter, roots) and crusts were major factors in the variation of the surface (0-20 cm) infiltration properties, while subsurface (20-40 cm) infiltration were mainly influenced by soil physical properties. The deeper soils had a greater impact on steady infiltration rate than initial infiltration rate. Due to the plough pan in agricultural lands, the subsurface soil (20-40 cm) had a strong effect (42.1%) on the steady infiltration rate of the surface (0-20 cm) soil, even close to the surface (0-20 cm) soils (49.8%). These findings improve the comprehensive understanding of the soil hydrological processes after farmlands conversions in semiarid areas.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV	2023	626		A						130283	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.130283		OCT 2023											WOS:001097691600001

A 6-year study of mature jojoba plants grown under field conditions with an intensive management regime evaluated the effect of N application rate on plant nutrient status, growth, and productivity, and nitrate accumulation in the soil. Five levels of N application were tested: 50, 150, 250, 370, and 500 kg N ha(-1). Fertilizers were provided throughout the growing season via a subsurface drip irrigation system. Leaf N concentration, in both spring and summer, reflected the level of N applied. A diagnostic leaf (youngest leaf that has reached full size) concentration of 1.3% N was identified as the threshold for N deficiency. Increasing rates of N application resulted in higher P levels in young leaves. Plant K status, as reflected in the leaf analysis, was not affected by N treatment but was strongly affected by fruit load. Vegetative growth was inhibited when only 50 kg N ha(-1) was applied. Soil analysis at the end of the fertilization season showed substantial accumulation of nitrate for the two highest application rates. Considering productivity, N costs, and environmental risk, 150 kg N ha(-1) is the recommended dosage for intensively grown jojoba. N deficiencies can be identified using leaf analysis, and excess N can be detected via soil sampling toward the end of the growing season. These results and tools will facilitate precise N fertilization in intensive jojoba plantations.

A cross-sectional study was carried out sampling 77 randomly selected households in four districts representing two agroecologies and production systems. E. coli was isolated and the susceptibility to 15 antimicrobials was assessed. Of 462 E. coli isolates tested, resistance to at least one antimicrobial was detected in 52% (43.7-60.8) of isolates from cattle fecal samples, 34% (95% CI, 26.2-41.8) from sheep samples, 58% (95% CI, 47.9-68.2) from goat samples and 53% (95% CI, 43.2-62.4) from soil samples. AMR patterns for E. coli from livestock and soil showed some similarities, with the highest prevalence of resistance detected against streptomycin (33%), followed by amoxycillin/clavulanate (23%) and tetracycline (8%). The odds of detecting E. coli resistance to =2 antimicrobials in livestock fecal samples were nearly three times (Odd Ratio-OR: 2.9; 95% CI, 1.72-5.17; p = 0.000) higher in lowland pastoral than in highland mixed crop-livestock production systems. These findings provide insights into the status of resistance in livestock and soil, and associated risk factors in low-resource settings in Ethiopia.

Forage is preserved mainly as silage, and microbial fermentation is key to high-quality silage. The fermentation quality of silage depends on the microbial community structure and the metabolites produced during silage fermentation. The current study provides evidence that the addition of malic or citric acid and/or Lactobacillus acidophilus (L) improves the quality of silage and inhibits the growth of harmful microorganisms. This study aimed to investigate the effects of citric acid, malic acid, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (L) on fermentation parameters and the microbial community of leguminous Chamaecrista rotundifolia silage. Fresh C. rotundifolia was treated without any additive (CK), or with L (10(6) CFU/g fresh weight), different levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1% fresh weight) of organic acid (malic or citric acid), and the combinations of L and the different levels of organic acids for 30, 45, and 60 days of ensiling. The effects of malic acid and citric acid were similar during the ensiling process. Treatment with either citric or malic acid and also when combined with L inhibited crude protein degradation, lowered pH and ammonia nitrogen, and increased lactic acid concentration and dry matter content (p < 0.05). The neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber increased initially and then decreased with fermentation time in all treatments (p < 0.05). Increasing the level of organic acid positively affected the chemical composition of C. rotundifolia silage. In addition, the addition of 1% organic acid increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, while the relative abundances of Clostridium and Enterobacter decreased at 60 days (p < 0.05). Moreover, both organic acids and combined additives increased (p < 0.05) the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria at 60 days of fermentation. We concluded that adding malic acid, citric acid, and L combined with an organic acid could improve the quality of C. rotundifolia silage and increase the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria. The addition of organic acid at a level of 1% was the most effective.

The demand for teff products is also increasing globally due to its health benefits as a gluten-free grain. However, teff productivity is low compared with other cereals. Crop yields vary widely among farms in rainfed production system. Identifying the key crop management practices and soil properties responsible for these variations will help to raise crop productivity through informed decision making by farmers, experts, researchers, and policy makers. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to assess the characteristics of the Ethiopian teff-cropping system, quantify the variability of grain yields among farms, and identify the impacts of different crop management practices and soil fertility parameters on yield variability. METHODS: The study examined 82 teff farms at three sites representing different teff-growing agro-ecologies in Ethiopia. Practices used to manage crops and soil on each farm were assessed. Composite topsoil samples were collected from farms at each site and analyzed for selected physical and chemical parameters. Grain and straw yields were quantified when crops were matured. Descriptive statistics, and factor analysis followed by multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that caused the variability of yields among farms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Teff yields were highly variable within and across different agro-ecologies. The crop management factors that greatly affected yields were N and P application rates and days to harvesting. The most important soil characteristics were total nitrogen, texture and micronutrients. Poor teff yields were attributable to failure to implement improved agronomic practices, poor soil fertility, and inefficient production systems. Teff production system is a low-yielding, less-profitable, and resource-intensive enterprise. The observed variations in yields among farms indicated that there is a big opportunity to improve teff productivity. The high frequency of tillage, monocropping, and complete removal of crop residues were major causes of the low soil fertility. SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding teff yield variability among farms helps to design appropriate yield improvement strategies. The use of low-cost crop-intensification options such as planting of improved cultivars using improved sowing methods, reduced tillage, incorporation of crop residues and legume-based crop rotation could sustainably improve productivity and restore soil fertility with minimal increases of costs in rainfed teff production system.

Energy substrate metabolism in skeletal muscle and liver when consuming diets of different energy levels: comparison between Tibetan and Small-tailed Han sheep	ANIMAL												The energy intake of Tibetan sheep on the harsh Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) varies greatlywith seasonal forage fluctuations and is often below maintenance requirements, especially during the long, cold winter. The liver plays a crucial role in gluconeogenesis and skeletal muscle is the primary tissue of energy expenditure in mammals. Both play important roles in energy substrate metabolism and regulating energymetabolism homeostasis of the body. This study aimed to gain insight into how skeletal muscle and liver of Tibetan sheep regulate energy substrate metabolism to cope with low energy intake under the harsh environment of the QTP. Tibetan sheep (n = 24; 48.5 +/- 1.89 kg BW) were compared with Small-tailed Han sheep (n = 24; 49.2 +/- 2.21 kg BW), which were allocated randomly into one of four groups that differed in dietary digestible energy densities: 8.21, 9.33, 10.45 and 11.57 MJ /kg DM. The sheep were slaughtered after a 49-d feeding period, skeletal muscle and liver tissueswere collected and measurements were made of the activities of the key enzymes of energy substrate metabolismand the expressions of genes related to energy homeostasis regulation. Compared with Small-tailed Han sheep, Tibetan sheep exhibited higher capacities of propionate to glucose conversion and fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis in the liver, higher glucose utilization efficiency in both skeletal muscle and liver, but lower activities of fatty acid oxidation and protein mobilization in skeletal muscle, especially when in negative energy balance. However, the Small-tailed Han sheep exhibited higher capacities to convert amino acids and lactate to glucose and higher levels of glycolysis and lipogenesis in the liver than Tibetan sheep. These differences in gluconeogenesis and energy substrate metabolism conferred the Tibetan sheep an advantage over Small-tailed Han sheep to cope with low energy intake and regulate whole-body energy homeostasis under the harsh environment of the QTP.

An integrated research framework combining genomics, systems biology, physiology, modelling and breeding for legume improvement in response to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> under climate change scenario	CURRENT PLANT BIOLOGY												How unprecedented changes in climatic conditions will impact yield and productivity of some crops and their response to existing stresses, abiotic and biotic interactions is a key global concern. Climate change can also alter natural species' abundance and distribution or favor invasive species, which in turn can modify ecosystem dynamics and the provisioning of ecosystem services. Basic anatomical differences in C-3 and C-4 plants lead to their varied responses to climate variations. In plants having a C-3 pathway of photosynthesis, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) positively regulates photosynthetic carbon (C) assimilation and depresses photorespiration. Legumes being C-3 plants, they may be in a favorable position to increase biomass and yield through various strategies. This paper comprehensively presents recent progress made in the physiological and molecular attributes in plants with special emphasis on legumes under elevated CO2 conditions in a climate change scenario. A strategic research framework for future action integrating genomics, systems biology, physiology and crop modelling approaches to cope with changing climate is also discussed. Advances in sequencing and phenotyping methodologies make it possible to use vast genetic and genomic resources by deploying high resolution phenotyping coupled with high throughput multi-omics approaches for trait improvement. Integrated crop modelling studies focusing on farming systems design and management, prediction of climate impacts and disease forecasting may also help in planning adaptation. Hence, an integrated research framework combining genomics, plant molecular physiology, crop breeding, systems biology and integrated crop-soil-climate modelling will be very effective to cope with climate change.

Hydrometeorological processes and evaporation from falling rain in Indian sub-continent: Insights from stable isotopes and meteorological parameters	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Rigorous analysis of measured isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta D) of 556 daily rainwater samples collected at four Indian stations viz., Jammu, Jorhat, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, is done in conjunction with satellite and model derived meteorological and isotopic parameters to discern prominent hydrometeorological processes and factors in four different climatic zones in the Indian subcontinent. A new Indian Meteoric Water Line (IMWL), better representing the different climatic zones, including the semi-arid western India, has been defined: [delta D = (7.6 +/- 0.1) delta O-18 + (8 +/- 1); R-2 = 0.96; P < 0.05; N = 556]. The lower slope of IMWL compared to the Global Meteoric Water Line signifies the role of evaporation from falling rain throughout the Indian subcontinent, though it is surrounded by large marine water body, and bordered by lofty Himalayan mountains in the north obstructing the monsoonal winds. This study provides new quantitative insights about various hydrometeorological processes across the Indian subcontinent. Some of the important inferences drawn from this study are: (i) The estimated evaporative losses from falling raindrops for the four stations are [Jammu: Maximum 52% and Minimum 8%; Jorhat: Max 15% and Min 4%; Ahmedabad Min 8% and Hyderabad Max 29% and Min 15%]. (ii) Increased availability of surface waters due to flood in Brahmaputra River and high value (88%) of column averaged RH results in the lowest evaporative loss from falling raindrops at Jorhat in Northeast. (iii) The high Cloud Liquid Water Content (CLWC) over a longer span of altitude facilitates the interaction of falling raindrop with isotopically depleted ambient vapor and results in isotopically depleted rain. (iv) The observed inverse relationship between the evaporative loss from falling raindrop and the column averaged RH confirms that the post condensation kinetic processes are realistically accounted in this study. (v) Validation with measured isotope data of rain shows that the LMDZ-iso modelled rain fails to incorporate evaporative isotopic enrichment and generates negative bias.

Transcriptional responses of toxigenic and atoxigenic isolates of <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> to oxidative stress in aflatoxin-conducive and non-conducive media	WORLD MYCOTOXIN JOURNAL												Aflatoxin production by isolates of Aspergillus flavus varies, ranging from highly toxigenic to completely atoxigenic. Several mechanisms have been identified which regulate aflatoxin production including medium carbon source and oxidative stress. In recent studies, aflatoxin production has been implicated in partially ameliorating oxidative stress in A. flavus. To better understand the role of aflatoxin production in oxidative stress responses, a selection of toxigenic and atoxigenic isolates of A. flavus with moderate to high oxidative stress tolerance were exposed to increasing concentrations of H2O2 in both aflatoxin-conducive and non-conducive media. Mycelial mats were collected for global transcriptome sequencing followed by differential expression, functional prediction, and weighted co-expression analyses. Oxidative stress and medium carbon source had a significant effect on the expression of several secondary metabolite gene clusters including those for aflatoxin, aflatrem, aflavarin, cyclopiazonic acid, and kojic acid. Atoxigenic biological control isolates showed less differential expression under stress than other atoxigenic isolates suggesting expression profiles may be useful in screening. Increasing stress also resulted in regulation of SakA/Hog1 and MpkA MAP kinase signalling pathways pointing to their potential roles in regulating oxidative stress responses. Their expression was also influenced by medium carbon source. These results suggest that aflatoxin production along with that of other mycotoxins may occur as part of a concerted coping mechanism for oxidative stress and its effects in the environment. This mechanism is also regulated by availability of simple sugars and glycolytic compounds for their biosynthesis.

Long-term drought forecasting is of great importance for the development of risk management strategies. Recently, large-scale climate drivers (e.g. El Nino-Southern Oscillation) have been demonstrated as useful in the application of drought forecasting. Machine learning-based models that use climate drivers as input are commonly adopted to provide drought forecasts as these models are easy to develop and require less information compared to physical-based models. However, few machine learning-based models have been developed to forecast drought conditions during growing season across all Australian cropping areas. In this study, we developed a growing season (Apr.-Nov.) meteorological drought forecasting model for each climate gauging location across the Australian wheatbelt based on multiple lagged (past) large-scale climate indices and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was used as the response variable to measure the degree of meteorological drought. Results showed that the RF model could provide satisfactory drought forecasts in the eastern areas of the wheatbelt with Pearson's correlation coefficient r > 0.5 and normalized Root Mean Square Error (nRMSE) < 23%. Forecasted drought maps matched well with observed drought maps for three representative periods. We identified NINO3.4 sea surface temperature and Multivariate ENSO Index as the most influential indices dominating growing season drought conditions across the wheatbelt. In addition, lagged impacts of large-scale climate drivers on growing season drought conditions were long-lasting and the indices in previous year could also potentially affect drought conditions during current year. As large-scale climate indices are readily available and can be rapidly used to feed data driven models, we believe the proposed meteorological drought forecasting models can be easily extended to other regions to provide drought outlooks which can help mitigate adverse drought impacts.

Soil organic carbon (SOC) potentially regulates the agricultural sustainability. Unfortunately, the SOC has been widely degraded through unsustainable land uses and agricultural practices. Hence, the efficacy of conservation tilling and diversified cropping were assessed in terms of restoration of SOC and associated soil properties in fixed plots, which are related with farm productivity and other ecosystem services under organic production systems of the Indian Himalayas. Three tillage management were selected as treatments of the study: i) conventional tilling (CT), ii) reduced tilling (RT), and iii) Zero tilling (ZT) applied to four diversified cropping systems [CS1- maize-black gram-toria, CS2 maize-black gram-buckwheat, CS3- maize-rajmash-toria and CS4 maize-rajmash-buckwheat]. The ZT had the highest SOC content (19.58 g kg-1) as well as the C pool (25.24 Mg ha-1) at a soil depth of 0-10 cm. On the contrary, ZT had the lowest rho b (1.29 Mg m3) and soil penetration resistance (1.32 MPa) at 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm soil depth. Concerning SOC partitioning, regardless of soil depth, it had been evident that more SOC were allocated in the active pool over the passive pool. Out of the diversified cropping systems, the CS2 produced a considerably higher total carbon pool of 24.98, and 23.0 Mg ha-1 at 0-10 cm, and 10-20 cm soil depths, respectively, and active and passive C pools. Hence, abolition of tillage and cultivation of legume embedding cropping systems resulted as a sustainable management system under organic farming for SOC restoration and soil quality improvement in the Himalayan ecosystem.

To fill this important gap, we designed an in vitro study to examine the effects of three Cu sources, namely Cu methionine (Met-Cu), Cu chloride (CuCl2) and tribasic Cu chloride (TBCC), at five levels, namely 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg/kg DM (includes Cu in substrate), on rumen fermentation in yaks. In vitro dry matter degradability (IVDMD) and amylase activity were greater (p < 0.05) with added Met-Cu than the other two Cu sources, and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), microbial protein (MCP) and propionate contents were greater with Met-Cu and CuCl2 than with TBCC. Total gas production and lipase activity were greater with Met-Cu and TBCC than CuCl2 (p < 0.05), which meant that the metabolizable energy yield was greater in the two former Cu sources than the latter, but CH4 production did not differ (p = 0.92) among Cu sources. IVDMD and lipase activity were greatest (p < 0.05) at 15 mg Cu/kg DM in the substrate and MCP, isobutyrate, butyrate and isovalerate contents, and amylase and trypsin activities were greatest or second greatest at 10 and 15 mg Cu/kg DM. It was concluded that Met-Cu was the best source of Cu and 10 to 15 mg Cu/kg DM was the optimal level for yaks, at least under in vitro conditions.

In previous studies, various relationships between various abiotic factors and PFTs have been reported. However, how these factors work together to influence PFTs is not clear. This study attempted to quantify the effects of topographic conditions, soil factors and vegetation structure on PFTs. Four categories of variables were represented using 29 variables collected from 171 herb plots of 57 sites (from different topographic and various herb types) in Xindian SWDP. The partial least squares structural equation modeling showed that the topographic conditions and soil properties also have a direct effect on plant functional traits. Among the topographic conditions, slope (SLO) has the biggest weight of 0.629, indicating that SLO contributed the most to plant functional traits and vegetation structure. Among soil properties, maximum water capacity (MWC) contributes the most and is followed by soil water content (SWC), weighted at 0.588 and 0.416, respectively. In a word, the research provides new points into the quantification of the correlation between different drivers that may be important for understanding the mechanisms of resource utilization, competition and adaptation to the environment during plant recovery.

The relationship between the distribution of roots in topsoil (0-0.4 m) and soil water use, dry matter and nitrogen (N) accumulations, and grain yield was examined in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with contrasting root size in the topsoil. Two old landraces (CW134 and JM47, larger root length and biomass in the topsoil) and two modern wheat cultivars (CH58 and LH7, smaller root system size in the topsoil), were grown in the field during two seasons (2016-2017 and 2017-2018) under rainfed and irrigation conditions in the semi-arid farmland on the Loess Plateau. Root biomass and root length density (RLD) in topsoil (0-0.4 m) was significantly higher in the old landraces than in the modern cultivars (P < 0.05) under rainfed and irrigation in both seasons (no such difference in subsoil, 0.4-1.0 m). The modern cultivars had significantly higher grain yield, grain N concentration, wateruse efficiency (WUE), and 1000-grain weight (P < 0.05). Seasonal water use was similar among all cultivars, but post-anthesis water use was higher in the modern cultivars, particularly under rainfed conditions in both seasons. Root biomass and RLD in the topsoil was positively correlated with pre-anthesis water use, but negatively correlated with after anthesis water use. Post-anthesis water use was closely related to post-anthesis dry matter, N accumulation, yield and WUE under rainfed conditions. To conclude, large distribution of mots in the topsoil had non-advantage for wheat grown under rainfed conditions. The small distribution of roots in the topsoil (characteristics of modern wheat cultivars) enhanced post-anthesis water use, increased post-anthesis dry matter and N accumulation, and hence attained higher grain yield and grain N when grown in the semi-arid environment.

Plastic mulching (PM) is widely used in China aiming to the increase of crop productivity. However, the impact of PM on reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions and nitrogen (N) footprint has not been explicitly described. In this study, we collected 4051 observations from 394 published papers for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and used meta-analysis to investigate how PM affected crop yield, net economic return, Nr emissions, and N footprints including nitrogen footprint per unit of output energy (NFo) and nitrogen footprint per unit of net economic return (NFe) at regional scale and across a range of precipitation and N fertilization gradients in China. The meta-analysis showed that compared to non-PM practice, PM increased grain yield by 25, 27, and 20% in potato, maize, and wheat, respectively, and enhanced net economic return by 19, 29, and 22%, respectively, with corresponding reduction in NFo of 24, 36, and 18% and NFe of 19, 37, and 19%, respectively. Potato and maize had greater energy output and net economic return than wheat. Plastic mulching was more effective in improving net economic return (or energy output) and reducing N footprints (i.e., NFe and NFo) in the semiarid region (i.e., annual precipitation <600 mm) when N was applied at 100-200 kg N ha(-1), especially in potato and maize. Our analysis suggests that the use of PMenhanced grain yield and net economic returnwhile lowering theNfootprint without increasingNr emission. Therefore, PM has great potential tomitigate Nr loss in Chinawhen crop species, N fertilization rate, and local environmental factors (i.e., growing region and annual precipitation) are appropriately considered.

The results showed that Y-p would decrease by 10.6-14.9% and 15.0-31.4% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for summer maize, and 13.9-19.7% and 18.5-36.3% for spring maize, respectively. The Y-w would decrease by 17.1-19.0% and 23.6-41.1% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for summer maize, and 20.9-24.5% and 27.8-45.5% for spring maize, respectively. The loss of Y-p and Y-w could be reduced by 2.6-9.7% and 0-9.9%, respectively, under future climate for summer maize through countermeasures. For spring maize, the loss of Y-p was mitigated by 14.0-25.0% and 2.0-21.8% for Y-w. The contribution of changing sowing date and plant density on spring maize yield was more than summer maize, and the optimal adaptation options were more effective for spring maize. Additionally, the influences of changing sowing date and planting density on yields become weak as climate changes become more severe. Therefore, it is important to investigate the potential of other adaptation measures to cope with climate change in the Guanzhong Plain of China.

In this study, four machine learning (ML) models, including random tree (RT), random forest (RF), additive regression (AR) and reduced error pruning tree (REPT) were used to model blue and green water footprint (BWFP and GWFP) for the present and future stages in the Yunnan Province, southwest China. Climate variables of daily precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, sunshine hours, wind speed, relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit data, yield and sown areas of rice were collected form 16 districts from 1990 to 2018. Six different scenarios (Sc1-Sc6) with different combinations of climate variables, crop coefficient and sown areas were used as inputs of the ML models for each of blue and green water footprint. Also, future climate projections of maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures, precipitation and sunshine were adopted for two different emission scenarios, RCP 4.5 and 8.5 from 2021to 2050, based on Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL-ESM2M) model. For BWFP, the RT model in Sc1 with inputs of solar radiation, humidity, and vapor pressure deficit, was superior to the other scenarios with root mean square error (RMSE) and mean average percentage error (MAPE) values of 11.82 (m(3) ton(-1)) and 0.5%, respectively. Sc4 (sown area, Tmin, sunshine hours) and Sc5 (sown area, Tmin, Tmax, crop coefficient) were the best two scenarios for all models applied for BWFP, while addition of precipitation to these two scenarios were the best for GWFP. Further, GWFP was highly negative anomaly in 2011 by 46%, 34% and 32% for the districts 5, 1 and 2 respectively, followed by 2010. Predictions of variable trends in the future showed that crop evapotranspiration during the growing season would increase in all the districts, although effective precipitation (Peff) would have both decreasing and increasing trends. Furthermore, BWFP and GWFP will have an upward trend in the future based on RCP4.5 in Sc4. This investigation addresses water footprint prediction which may assist in mitigation plans such as policies for sustainable water-use and development plans for food security.

Towards this end, the coupled sorption and abiotic oxidation kinetics of Sb(III) were examined across 12 soils with a 24 h timeframe. The soil-solution distribution coefficients (Kd) of Sb ranged between 214 and 5965 L kg- 1. Both apparent and mechanistic kinetic models were used to described the process. The apparent kinetic model indicated a two-rate oxidation and associated stabilization behavior of Sb in soils. The fast oxidation rate constants ranged from 0.147 to 0.763 h-1, which were one to two orders of magnitudes higher than the slow rate constants (0.002-0.039 h-1). Iron and Mn oxides were identified as the key soil components associated with adsorptive-oxidative sites (SOH) and oxidative sites (Mn-OH) of soils for Sb species, and these were subsequently integrated into the mechanistic kinetic model. This model included the adsorption-desorption of Sb(III) as well as the oxidation product, Sb(V) on the SOH, the oxidation of Sb(III) by SOH and Mn-OH, and the stabilization of both Sb(III) and Sb(V). The model produced a global fit for dissolved and adsorbed Sb species across the 12 soils. This study provides new information for predicting the dynamics of Sb in soils when multiple adsorption-desorption, oxidation and stabilization reactions are coupled in natural environments.

However, it has yet to be established how different microbial functional genes influence the rate of soil net N mineralisation along such gradients. To address this deficiency in our current knowledge, we performed metagenomic sequencing to identify soil microbial functional genes encoding enzymes involved in N cycling at five forest sites along an elevational gradient spanning a range from 1503 to 3182 m above sea level. Our results indicate that the rate of net N mineralisation follows a unimodal pattern with increasing elevation, with a peak (0.18 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) being detected at the mid-high elevation site. Further, we detected a significant correlation between the abundance of genes encoding enzymes involved in denitrification and ammonia assimilation pathways and net N mineralisation rate (p < 0.05). Moreover, we established that microbial species in the phyla Cyanobacteria, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes, harbouring keystone functional genes, play a predominant role in determining the rate of net N mineralisation. Our findings also revealed soil substrate content (ammonium nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen, soil organic carbon, and C:N ratio) and soil environment (soil temperature and soil moisture) to be the major drivers of net N mineralisation in soil via their regulatory effects on the composition of microbial communities and functional genes. Our characterisation of the microbial metagenomic basis of net N mineralisation in forest soils accordingly highlights the importance of the combined contributions of soil microbial functional genes, soil substrate, and environmental factors in determining the cycling of N in forest soils at different elevations. Highlights Net N mineralisation rate followed a unimodal pattern along an elevational gradient. Denitrification and ammonia assimilation genes were correlated with net N mineralisation rate. Cyanobacteria play a dominant role in determining net N mineralisation rate. Soil substrate and environment determine microbial functional gene distribution.

We evaluated the effect of K on fiber elongation using two cotton cultivars, Simian 3 and Siza 3, grown in well-watered and drought-stressed conditions. Potassium fertilizer (K2O) was applied 0, 150, or 300 kg ha(-1) in each growing condition. Drought stress reduced the final fiber length due to a decline in the maximum rate of rapid elongation (V-max, mm day(-1)). The application of K alleviated the drought-induced fiber length reduction by increasing V-max. At 10 and 15 days post-anthesis (DPA), drought significantly reduced osmotic potential (OP) and increased K+ and malate contents at all K rates, relative to well-watered conditions, which was associated with increased activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), V-ATPase, PPase, and PM H+-ATPase in cotton fiber. However, the relative contribution of K+ and malate to OP declined under drought in comparison with well-watered condition. Compared with control without K, K application decreased OP and increased the accumulation of osmolytes (K+, malate and soluble sugar) as well as the activities of related enzymes in fiber irrespective of water treatments. Moreover, K application increased osmotic adjustment during drought, and improved the contribution of K+ and malate to OP, especially under drought stress. This study showed that drought decreased fiber length by reducing V-max, and K application ameliorates the decline in fiber elongation due to drought by enhancing osmolytes accumulation and their contribution to OP in fiber cells.

In recent decades, incor-porating straw in farmland fields has become an effective method of utilizing maize straw resources. However, the effect of straw incorporation on the rill flow velocity of sloping farmland is unclear. In this study, experi-mental treatments with three gradients of maize straw length (6, 9, and 12 cm), incorporation depth (9, 12, and 15 cm), and straw amount (1000, 4500, and 8000 kg ha-1) were set up. Flow velocity was measured via an electrolyte tracer measurement system, and the comprehensive effect of straw incorporation on the rill erosion flow velocity of sloping farmland was clarified using structural equation modeling. The results showed that the mean flow velocity of straw-incorporated sloping land was 0.120-0.189 m s-1, which was 13.25-44.92% lower than that of bare land. The flow path became convoluted owing to the residual straw on the soil surface, which increased the flow resistance thereby reducing the flow velocity. Straw length had the greatest effect on flow velocity (with a contribution rate of 46.67%), and significant increases in velocity were observed with increases in straw length owing to the water-collecting function of the exposed straw on the soil surface. In addition, the flow velocity increased with an increase in runoff and decreased with an increase in infiltration but had no evident response to sediment yield. Increasing the straw amount had a negative impact on soil bulk density and infiltration, resulting in an increase in rill flow velocity. The incorporation depth had a very small effect on flow velocity. The results are helpful for understanding the changes in rill flow velocity and interpreting the soil erosion process on sloping farmland with straw incorporation.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				JUN	2023	621								129550	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129550	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2023.129550		MAY 2023											WOS:000998072700001

The Penman-Monteith model (P-M) has been widely used to simulate crop ET. In the P-M model, the estimation accuracy of canopy resistance (r(c)) has a direct impact on ET. In this study, based on the eddy covariance system, large-scale lysimeter and meteorological station data from three sites (Yucheng, Yangling and Shangqiu) in semi-humid regions of northern China, the P-M model was applied to obtain canopy resistance (r(c)-(PM)) and correlation significances between r(c-PM )and different impact factors (R-n net radiation, T temperature, VPD saturated vapor pressure difference, theta soil moisture content, LAI leaf area index) were analysed. The whole growth period of maize was divided according to different LAI thresholds (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 m(2)m(- 2)). The Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms were used to optimize the empirical parameters of the Jarvis model, and the P-M model was applied to estimate ET under different LAI thresholds at the three stations. The correlation significances of r(c-PM) with different influencing factors followed the order R-n > LAI > theta > VPD > T, and it was extremely significant with Rn (P < 0.01) and significant with LAI and theta (P < 0.05). The GA and DE algorithm optimization results showed that the calculation accuracy of r(c) was highest when LAI=0.5 m(2) m(- 2 )at Yucheng station, with R(2 )of 0.80 and 0.81, respectively, and when LAI=1.0 m(2) m(-2), and the accuracy of r(c) was highest at Yangling station, with R-2 of 0.87 and 0.89, respectively, and when LAI = 1.0 m(2) m( -2), and the accuracy of r(c) was highest at Shangqiu station, with R-2 of 0.84 and 0.84, respectively. Combined with P-M model to calculate maize ET under different LAI thresholds, the simulation accuracy of ET was best when LAI = 0.5 m(2 )m(-2 )at Yucheng station, with averege R-2 of 0.85, the order of simulation ET accuracy was: 0.5 > 1.0 > 1.5 > 2.0 > 3.0 > 0.1 m(2) m(-2). When LAI = 1.0 m(2 )m(-2), and the accuracy of maize ET was highest at Yangling and Shangqiu stations, with averege R-2 of 0.83 and 0.85, respectively, the order of simulation ET accuracy was: 1.0 > 0.5 > 1.5 > 2.0 > 3.0 > 0.1 m(2) m-( 2). ET accuracy calculated by the DE optimization algorithm was better than that of the GA optimization algorithm, with R-2 of 0.40-0.84 and 0.58-0.86, respectively. This study suggests that the algorithm is of great importance to optimize the empirical parameters of the Jarvis model, of which DE optimization algorithm is recommended to simulate maize ET in semi-humid regions of northern China.

Gastrointestinal nematodes in two galliform birds from South Africa: patterns associated with host sex and age	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												Parasite ecology has recently focused on elucidating patterns and processes that shape helminth communities in avian hosts. However, helminths parasitizing gamebirds are still poorly understood. Here we describe the gastrointestinal nematode fauna of Swainson's spurfowl, Pternistis swainsonii (Phasianidae) and helmeted guineafowl, Numida meleagris (Numididae), collected at three and four localities, respectively, in South Africa and analyze the prevalence, mean abundance and diversity of their helminth communities. Eleven nematode species were collected from spurfowl, which had a mean number of nematode species per host of 3.01 +/- 0.18, whereas guineafowl harboured 15 nematode species, with a mean number of nematode species per host of 3.93 +/- 0.12. Focusing on the most prevalent species, we also asked if host sex and/or age were associated with infracommunity structure with regard to nematode counts and species richness, as well as the species and taxonomic composition of infracommunities. While pooling data of nematode species masked the influence of host characteristics on helminth communities, analysis of individual nematode species revealed a number of patterns. In particular, adult female bias was seen in Tetrameres swainsonii in spurfowl and in Allodapa dentigera and Gongylonema congolense in guineafowl; Acuaria gruveli reached higher numbers in adult spurfowl than in juveniles, and helminth infracommunities in juvenile male guineafowl were more species rich than those in adult males. Combined, our results suggest that helminth communities of spurfowl and guineafowl are associated with a complex interplay of numerous factors, including host characteristics, parasite traits and environmental conditions.

M.; Chen, Yinglong			Maize genotypes with deep root systems tolerate salt stress better than those with shallow root systems during early growth	JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE												Maize (Zea maysL.) is susceptible to salinity but shows genotypic variation for salt tolerance. How maize genotypes with contrasting root morphological traits respond to salt stress remains unclear. This study assessed genotypic variation in salinity tolerance of 20 maize genotypes with contrasting root systems exposed to NaCl for 10 days (0, 50 mM or 100 mM NaCl, added in four increments every other day from 14 days after transplanting, DAT) in a semi-hydroponic phenotyping system in a temperature-controlled greenhouse. Considerable variation was observed for each of the 12 measured shoot and root traits among the 20 genotypes under NaCl treatments. Salt stress significantly decreased biomass production by up to 54% in shoots and 37% in roots compared with the non-saline control. The 20 genotypes were classified as salt-tolerant (8 genotypes), moderately tolerant (5) and salt-sensitive (7) genotypes based on the mean shoot dry weight ratio (the ratio of shoot dry weight at 100 mM NaCl and non-saline control) +/- one standard error. The more salt-tolerant genotypes (such as Jindan52) had less reductions in growth, and lower shoot Na(+)contents and higher shoot K+/Na(+)ratios under salt stress. The declared salt tolerance was positively correlated with shoot height, shoot dry weight and primary root depth, and negatively correlated with shoot Na(+)content at 100 mM NaCl. Primary root depth is critical for identifying salt responsiveness in maize plants and could be suggested as a selection criterion for screening salt tolerance of maize during early growth. The selected salt-tolerant genotypes have potentials for cultivation in saline soils and for developing high-yielding salt-tolerant maize hybrids in future breeding programmes.

Application of silicon (Si) or nitric oxide (NO) could alleviate Cd accumulation and toxicity in plants, but whether they have joint effects on alleviating of Cd accumulation and toxicity are not known. Therefore, the combined effect of Si and NO application on maize growth, Cd uptake, Cd transports and Cd accumulation were investigated in a pot experiment. Here, we reported that Cd stress decreased growth, caused Cd accumulation in plants. The combined application of Si and NO triggered a significant response in maize, increasing plant growth and reducing Cd uptake, accumulation, translocation and bioaccumulation factors under Cd stress. The grain Cd concentration was decreased by 66 % in the Si and NO combined treatment than Cd treatment. Moreover, the combined application of Si and NO reduced Cd health risk index in maize more effectively than either treatment alone. This study provided new evidence that Si and NO have a strong joint effect on alleviating the adverse effects of Cd toxicity by decreasing Cd uptake and accumulation. We advocate for supplement of Cd-contaminated soil with Si fertilizers and treatment of crops with NO as a practical approach to alleviating Cd toxicity.

However, the effects of nitrogen (N) fertilization on photosynthate C allocation to rhizodeposition of wheat grown in an intensively farmed alkaline soil remain elusive. In this study, pot-grown winter wheat under N fertilization of 250 kg N ha(-1) was pulse-labeled with (CO2)-C-13 at tillering, elongation, anthesis, and grain-filling stages. The C-13 in shoots, roots, soil organic carbon (SOC), and rhizosphere-respired CO2 was measured 28 d after each C-13 labeling. The proportion of net-photosynthesized C-13 recovered (shoots + roots + soil + soil respired CO2) in the shoots increased from 58-64% at the tillering to 86-91% at the grain-filling stage. Likewise, the proportion in the roots decreased from 21-28% to 2-3%, and that in the SOC pool increased from 1-2% to 6-7%. However, the C-13 respired CO2 allocated to soil peaked (17-18%) at the elongation stage and decreased to 6-8% at the grain-filling stage. Over the entire growth season of wheat, N fertilization decreased the proportion of net photosynthate C translocated to the below-ground pool by about 20%, but increased the total amount of fixed photosynthate C, and therefore increased the below-ground photosynthate C input. We found that the chase period of about 4 weeks is sufficient to accurately monitor the recovery of C-13 after pulse labeling in a wheat-soil system. We conclude that N fertilization increased the deposition of photoassimilate C into SOC pools over the entire growth season of wheat compared to the control treatment.

Muscle tissue, comprising 30-40% of the total body mass, produces heat during cold exposure. However, little is known about the genetic mechanisms of this tissue and its rote in thermogenesis in lambs. We examined genes in skeletal muscle tissue in a cold-adapted sheep breed, Altay, and a coldintolerant sheep breed, Hu, when exposed to low air temperature. Three ewe-lambs of each breed were maintained at -5 degrees C and three ewe-lambs of each breed were maintained at 20 degrees C. After cold exposure for 25 days, the longissimus dorsi of each lamb was collected, and transcriptome profiles were sequenced and analyzed. The results of RNA-seq showed that the average reads among the four groups were 11.0 Gbase. The genome mapping rate averaged 88.1% and the gene mapping rate averaged 82.5%. The analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicated that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), cAMP, and calcium signaling pathways and muscle contraction in muscle tissue were linked to thermogenesis in cold-exposed lambs. Furthermore, POU (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinasel) increased glyceroneogenesis in cold-exposed Altay lambs, and APOC3 (apolipoprotein C3), LPL (lipoprotein lipase), and FABP4 (fatty acid binding protein 4, adipocyte) were involved in the intake and transport of free fatty acids. In Hu sheep, cAMP biosynthesis from ATP hydrolysis was regulated by ADCY10 (adenylate cyclase) and ADORA2a (adenosine Ala receptor). Skeletal muscle contraction was regulated by MYL2 (myosin light chain 2). In conclusion, cold exposure altered the expression level of genes involved in heat production in muscle tissue. Some potential mechanisms were revealed, including calcium ion transport in the calcium signaling pathway, fatty acid metabolism in the PPAR signaling pathway, and cAMP biosynthesis in the cAMP signaling pathway. This study implied that skeletal muscle plays an important role in thermoregulation in lambs.																				1664-8021				OCT 21	2022	13								1011458	10.3389/fgene.2022.1017458	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.1017458								36338953					WOS:000880299500001

A long-term (19 year) rice-wheat system experiment was examined to find out the best nutrient management practices (BNMP) through recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF), integrated plant nutrition system (IPNS), soil test crop response (STCR), farmyard manure (FYM), along with the inclusion of pulses (berseem and cowpea). Seven nutrient management practices were applied in combination of organic and chemical fertilizer in the rice-wheat system. Results showed that a significant variation was seen in phosphorus (P) fractions among the treatments and soil depths. The results showed a significantly (p < 0.05) higher contribution to phosphorus availability by Residual-P followed by NaHCO3-Po > NaOH-Pi > NaOH-Po > HCl-P > NaHCO3-Pi > available P and lowest in WSP under different long-term management options in rice-wheat system after completing 19 crop cycles. Variations in soil P-fractions with depth were compared to different treatment combination, and a considerable increase in all the major P-fractions was noticed. The continuous application of various IPNS options as organic farming (OF), RDF, STCR, and the inclusion of pulses (berseem and cowpea) significantly improved all P fractions in the soil system and offered an added benefit in terms of sustainability of production and soil health compared to the solo application of chemical fertilizers. Overall, results showed that IPNS options (berseem and cowpea) showed its superiority over the rest of the treatment. This study suggests that the inclusion of pulses would increase P-availability in soil system.

A wide range of input data are often needed to forecast crop yield in a region where sophisticated approaches such as machine learning and process-based models are used. This requires considerable effort for data preparation in addition to identifying data sources. Here, we propose a simpler approach called the Analogy Based Crop-yield (ABC) forecast scheme to make timely and accurate prediction of regional crop yield using a minimum set of inputs. In the ABC method, a growing season from a prior long-term period, e.g., 10 years, is first identified as analogous to the current season by the use of a similarity index based on the time series leaf area index (LAI) patterns. Crop yield in the given growing season is then forecasted using the weighted yield average reported in the analogous seasons for the area of interest. The ABC approach was used to predict corn and soybean yields in the Midwestern U.S. at the county level for the period of 2017-2019. The MOD15A2H, which is a satellite data product for LAI, was used to compile inputs. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of crop yield forecasts was <10% for corn and soybean in each growing season when the time series of LAI from the day of year 89 to 209 was used as inputs to the ABC approach. The prediction error for the ABC approach was comparable to results from a deep neural network model that relied on soil and weather data as well as satellite data in a previous study. These results indicate that the ABC approach allowed for crop yield forecast with a lead-time of at least two months before harvest. In particular, the ABC scheme would be useful for regions where crop yield forecasts are limited by availability of reliable environmental data.

J	Zhang, ZC; Liu, Y; Sun, J; Wu, GL				Zhang, Zhenchao; Liu, Yu; Sun, Jian; Wu, Gao-Lin			Suitable duration of grazing exclusion for restoration of a degraded alpine meadow on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	CATENA												Grazing exclusion (GE) is a key national ecological restoration project widely applied to rehabilitate degraded grasslands. To date, there have been many debates on the effectiveness of GE for grassland recovery, and it is still poorly understood how degraded alpine meadows in the semi-humid area with relative rich rainfall in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau respond to GE with different durations. We selected a chronosequence of grazing-excluded alpine meadows to examine the dynamics of grassland functions. The results showed that the dominant functional group shifted from forbs to graminoids after 8 to 10 years GE and then returned to forbs. The plant population density increased significantly with GE time (P < 0.01). The total biomass, species richness, Shannon diversity index, and relative importance value of graminoids first increased and then decreased with increasing plant population density, whereas the relative importance value of forbs presented the opposite trend. All turning points were between 1350 and 1650 plants per m(2) which occurred from 8 to 10 years of GE. As the duration of GE increased, the ecosystem multifunctionality first dramatically increased and then became steady after 8 to 10 years of GE. These findings imply that GE is of great practical significance to prevent degradation in semi-humid regions of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, where we recommend that GE should cease after approximately 8 to 10 years to restore degraded alpine meadows from the perspective of plant productivity, diversity, community structure, and ecosystem multifunctionality.

J	Mu, HL; Fu, SH; Yu, BF; Zhang, GH				Mu, Hongli; Fu, Suhua; Yu, Bofu; Zhang, Guanghui			Predicting the sediment transport capacity from flow condition and particle size in the presence of vegetation cover	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												The sediment transport capacity plays a pivotal role in erosion research, and is usually predicted using hydraulic variables. The transport capacity and hydraulic variables are affected by vegetation cover. Our understanding of the effect of vegetation cover, including the size, density, and arrangement of vegetation stems, on the relationship between the sediment transport capacity and hydraulic variables were rather limited. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect vegetation stem cover on the relationship between hydraulic variables and the sediment transport capacity and to derive an equation for predicting the sediment transport capacity in the presence of vegetation cover. Five data sets from 288 flume experiments with a wide range of discharge (0.25-2 x 10(-3)m(3)s(-1)), slope (8.8-42.3%), median sediment diameter (0.11-1.16 x 10(-3) m), stem cover (0-30%), stem diameter (2-36 mm), and stem arrangement (bead, tessellation, zigzag, random, and banding) were compiled for this study. Extensive regression analysis has shown that the sediment transport capacity could be expressed as a power function of flow velocity, shear stress, stream power, or unit stream power. Predictors of the sediment transport capacity were ranked from the unit stream power as the strongest, followed by the stream power, flow velocity, and the shear stress. Vegetation stem cover had no apparent and direct effect on the relationship between hydraulic variables and the sediment transport capacity so long as the unit stream power or stream power was used as its predictor. Vegetation cover became a significant factor only when the shear stress was used to predict the sediment transport capacity. Finally, a new equation involving the slope gradient, flow velocity, and median sediment diameter in a nondimensional form was shown to be a superior predictor of the sediment transport capacity with the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency of 0.92. The product of slope and flow velocity, that is, the unit stream power, captures the effect of vegetation stem cover and surface roughness and was shown to be an effective predictor of the transport capacity in the presence of vegetation cover.

Satellite measurements can complement the restrictive coverage afforded by in-situ measurements and have the potential to facilitate the monitoring of cropland photosynthesis over a large spatial scale in a cost-effective manner. Traditionally, space-based monitoring of cropland photosynthetic activity, especially Light-use efficiency (LUE), has relied on empirical relationships between satellite spectral reflectance and ground climate and vegetation conditions. Space-borne retrievals of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an independent measurement, has shown to provide a more direct estimation of photosynthetic activity than traditional methods, and may further allow the inference of LUE. This study has empirically explored the possibility of remotely monitoring large-scale LUE by calculating the ratio of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) normalized SIF to the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). We applied this calculation to demonstrate the spatial patterns and seasonal dynamics of LUE and its related measurements in response to land surface temperature (LST) across Australian rainfed croplands from 2007 to 2016. LST was used to provide an integrated measure of vegetation water and heat stress at the canopy level. Our results showed that LUE tends to be higher in the geographical middle zones than in either the warmer northern or the cooler southern regions. Temporally, we found that there was a seasonal asymmetry of LUE and its related measurements in response to LST change throughout the winter crop-growing season. Statistical tests revealed that the optimum LST range for satellite-based LUE was 16.6-17.6 degrees C during August. The more LST exceeded this optimum, the more sensitive LUE was found to be. Pixels in August with optimum LST across the ten-year sampling period (Augusts of 2007-2016) were distributed in the southern-middle to middle zones of the Australian rainfed croplands.

Impact of Fusarium verticillioides on chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of two maize lines	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY												Fusarium verticillioides is one of the most common phytopathogenic fungi affecting maize production, worldwide. The early identification of F. verticillioides infection in maize could be helpful to prevent the spreading of the fungus. Therefore, this study represents the use of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters to identify F. verticillioides infection in maize. Chlorophyll a fluorescence of control and F. verticillioides infected plants showed a typical polyphasic OJIP transient curve in both MO17 and B73 lines. Infected plants from both maize lines showed a different pattern of OJIP transient curve when compared to the control plants, respectively. This indicated that F. verticillioides had an effect on the photosynthesis of infected maize plants. This study demonstrated the importance of parameters such as: the activity of the water-splitting complex on the donor side of PSII (F-v/F-0), minimum fluorescence (F-0), maximum fluorescence (F-m), and absorption flux per one active reaction center (ABS/RC) to identify F. verticillioides infection in maize.

Large land restoration projects (e.g., the "Grain for Green" launched in 1999 and the "Gully Land Consolidation" launched in 2011) had substantial impacts on the storage, distribution, and spatial patterns of soil water, and these factors remain poorly understood across watershed scales. We measured the amount of water stored in soil layers from the surface down to 5 m depth and characterized the vertical distribution of gravimetric soil water content (SWC) among four land uses (cropland, shrubland, forestland, and orchard), two slope aspects (shady vs. sunny), and two landforms (slope vs. gully) in three watersheds on the Chinese Loess Plateau. All three of the watersheds were affected by Grain for Green project, two were affected by the Gully Land Consolidation project (named NG and GT-T watersheds) and one was unaffected by restoration efforts (named GT-U watershed). In the three watersheds, the slope and gully SWCs varied from 2.4 to 24.2% and from 4.8 to 46.6%, respectively, during the sampling period in October 2015 (end of the rainy season). The amount and vertical distribution of slope SWC differed significantly among the land uses and between shady and sunny slopes in the three watersheds (p < 0.05). The mean gully SWC (20.4%) was significantly higher than the mean slope SWC (8.7%) for each of the three watersheds (p < 0.01). Gullies filled by the Gully Land Consolidation project had a large capacity to store soil water by increasing the infiltration of precipitation, which accounted for 14.7% and 11.3% of the total annual rainfall in the NG and GT-T watersheds, respectively. Filled gullies can serve as large reservoirs of soil water to relieve the problem of water shortage and can also increase the amount of land available for cultivation to ease deficits in food production. A combination of the Grain for Green project on slopes for soil conservation and the Gully Land Consolidation project in gullies for storing more soil water and increasing farmland area is an effective land restoration strategy on the Chinese Loess Plateau and is helpful for managing water cycles in regions around the world with deep soils.

However, information regarding these soil properties in existing datasets is often scarce and inaccurate for high, cold mountainous areas such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). To help bridge this gap, we have compiled an SHP and SM dataset for the northeastern QTP (a major high, cold mountainous area) using measurements of soil collected at 5 and 25 cm depths from 206 sampling sites, and in-situ observations from 32 SM monitoring stations at 5, 15, 25, 40, and 60 cm depths. We used this dataset to explore large-scale variations (spatial and temporal) in SHPs and SM across the study area. We also evaluated several widely used SHP (soil texture, bulk density, and saturated hydraulic conductivity) and SM datasets derived by remote-sensing methods, reanalysis and data assimilation. Our datasets showed that SM significantly decreases from the southeastern part to the northwestern part in the study area, and SM decreases with increases in depth over 0-70 cm. Moreover, the regional annual SM showed decreased trend from 2014 to 2020 in the study area. Additionally, we detected substantial bias in the currently available large SHP datasets, which do not capture the spatial variability recorded in the in-situ observations. Especially, clay and sand estimates from both HWSD and SoilGrid datasets were significantly overestimated, and silt was significantly underestimated within the depth of 0-30 cm in the study area. We also found that SM values derived from remote sensing datasets fitted the in-situ SM observations better than those derived from the reanalysis data (which had higher bias) and data assimilation (which did not capture the temporal variability of SM). Our findings emphasize the unneglectable bias of the widely-used large-scale SHP datasets, especially for the soil texture data. Thus, an urgent need for large-scale field sampling of SHP in mountainous areas. The in-situ observation dataset presented here provides important information with unprecedented coverage and resolution regarding the SHP variability and long-term SM trends across a large, high, cold mountainous area, thereby enhancing our understanding of water cycles and energy exchange processes over the QTP.					tian, jie/ABD-4663-2021; shuqian, liu/CAF-5267-2022; Wang, Xuejin/HLX-4185-2023; He, Chansheng/A-3337-2008	tian, jie/0000-0002-4845-5085; Wang, Xuejin/0000-0002-0763-4597; He, Chansheng/0000-0001-7748-0485													1674-7313	1869-1897				AUG	2023	66	8					1757	1775		10.1007/s11430-022-1120-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-022-1120-5		JUL 2023											WOS:001036676800001

Most of the CANDs are membrane proteins and play indispensable roles in signal transduction. In this study, the CANDs from four cotton species were characterized, and the phylogenetic relationships, expression patterns, stress responses of cotton CANDs were analyzed by bioinformatics. Through the analysis of phylogenetic and protein structure, it was found that the CANDs in clade II might function as cotton melatonin receptors, and most of the GhCANDs in clade II were induced by melatonin. A putative cotton melatonin receptor, GhCAND2-D5, was functionally probed by gene silencing. The plants with silenced expression of this gene exhibited decreased salt tolerance. Protein interaction prediction identified that GhCAND2-D5 interacted with several membrane proteins and played an important role in melatonin signaling. This study provided a theoretical reference for further investigation of melatonin signaling in cotton.

Whether reduced tillage with stubble remaining (RTS) and nitrogen (N) application improve soil carbon storage and grain yield simul-taneously and its impact on soil aggregation and soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions are still controversial. A 4 -year experiment, including four treatments (CT, rotary tillage with stubble removing; RTS; CT+N; RTS+N), was conducted to explore the effects of RTS and N application on soil aggregates and soil organic carbon fractions, and answer whether the combination of RTS and N application can simultaneously improve soil carbon storage, crop yield and water productivity in summer maize-winter wheat rotation (MWR) system. The results showed that soil aggregates stability and SOC content of RTS+N increased by 34.9% and 9.2% due to increased pro-portion of large macroaggregate (LM, increased by 6.6%) and small macroaggregate (SM, increased by 6.9%), respectively, compared to CT+N at the end of the 4-year experiment. RTS significantly increased particular organic carbon (POC) content, and N application significantly increased the mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) content. Compared with CT, the POC, MAOC and POC/MAOC increased by 42.7%, 18.7% and 20.4% in bulk soil, increased by 19.6%, 8.5% and 10.5% in LM, increased by 33.2%, 14.2% and 17.1% in SM, increased by 25.9%, 16.8% and 8.3% in microaggregate, respectively, under RTS+N. Meanwhile, the mean grain yield, yield stability and water productivity of RTS+N increased by 33.7%, 206.4% and 43.4% for summer maize, and increased by 7.0%, 29.3% and 3.0% for winter wheat compared with CT+N. Therefore, reduced tillage with stubble remaining combined with nitrogen application in semi humid and drought-prone areas can simulta-neously increase soil carbon storage, grain yield and water productivity in the MWR system.

Cold Response	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Cold stress is a major environmental factor that affects plant growth and development, as well as fruit postharvest life and quality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding small RNAs that play crucial roles in various abiotic stresses. Peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.), one of the most important grain legumes and source of edible oils and proteins, are cultivated in the semi-arid tropical and subtropical regions of the world. To date, there has been no report on the role of miRNAs in the response to cold stress in cultivated peanuts. In this study, we profiled cold-responsive miRNAs in peanuts using deep sequencing in cold-sensitive (WQL20) alongside a tolerant variety (WQL30). A total of 407 known miRNAs and 143 novel peanut-specific miRNAs were identified. The expression of selected known and novel miRNAs was validated by northern blotting and six known cold-responsive miRNAs were revealed. Degradome sequencing identified six cold-responsive miRNAs that regulate 12 target genes. The correlative expression patterns of several miRNAs and their target genes were further validated using qRT-PCR. Our data showed that miR160-ARF, miR482-WDRL, miR2118-DR, miR396-GRF, miR162-DCL, miR1511-SRF, and miR1511-SPIRAL1 modules may mediate cold stress responses. Transient expression analysis in Nicotiana benthamiana found that miR160, miR482, and miR2118 may play positive roles, and miR396, miR162, and miR1511 play negative roles in the regulation of peanut cold tolerance. Our results provide a foundation for understanding miRNA-dependent cold stress response in peanuts. The characterized correlations between miRNAs and their response to cold stress could serve as markers in breeding programs or tools for improving cold tolerance of peanuts.																			1664-462X					JUN 2	2022	13								920195	10.3389/fpls.2022.920195	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.920195								35720560					WOS:000811835100001

Notable concentrations of Ca-containing compounds were detected in Teflon holders, which are routinely used in many experimental setups, including for solution deposition of semiconductor thin films. It was found that Ca2+ cations leached out from the Teflon sample holders into the aqueous deposition solution and contaminated the PbS:Th thin films.

(yellow water lily) have been used to treat several inflammatory and pathogen-related diseases. It has shown that Nuphar lutea extracts (NUP) are active against various pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and leishmanial parasites. In an effort to detect novel therapeutic agents against negative-stranded RNA (- RNA) viruses, we have tested the effect of a partially-purified alkaloid mixture of Nuphar lutea leaves on the measles virus (MV). The MV vaccine's Edmonston strain was used to acutely or persistently infect cells. The levels of several MV proteins were detected by a Western blot and immunocytochemistry. Viral RNAs were quantitated by qRT-PCR. Virus infectivity was monitored by infecting African green monkey kidney VERO cells' monolayers. We showed that NUP protected cells from acute infection. Decreases in the MV P-, N-, and V-proteins were observed in persistently infected cells and the amount of infective virus released was reduced as compared to untreated cells. By examining viral RNAs, we suggest that NUP acts at the post-transcriptional level. We conclude, as a proof of concept, that NUP has anti-viral therapeutic activity against the MV. Future studies will determine the mechanism of action and the effect of NUP on other related viruses.

Using noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD), our objective was to inspect the scale-dependent interactions between K-ns and various soil properties and to estimate K-ns based on such relationships. In a rectangular field evenly across cropland and grassland, a total of 44 sampling points separated by 5 m were selected and measured for K-ns at soil water pressure heads of -1, -5 and -10 cm. At each point, the saturated conductivity K-s was estimated using Gardner's exponential function, and six soil structural and textural properties were investigated. Decomposed into four intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue by NA-MEMD, each K was found to significantly correlate with all six properties at one spatial scale at least. The variations in K were primarily regulated by soil structure, especially at the relatively small scales. Multiple linear regression (MLR) failed to regress either IMF1 or IMF2 of each K from the soil properties of the equivalent scales and only accounted for 13.7 to 43.6% of the total variance in calibration for the remaining half of the IMF1s and IMF2s. An artificial neural network was then adopted to estimate IMF1 and IMF2, and the corresponding results were added to the MLR estimates at other scales for which each K was estimated at the measurement scale. This prediction greatly outperformed the MLR modeling before NA-MEMD and, on average, accounted for additional 74.4 and 73.4% of the total variance in calibration and validation, respectively. These findings suggest nonlinear correlations between K and the soil properties investigated at the small scales and hold important implications for future estimations of K-ns and K-s as well as other hydraulic properties.

Soil inorganic carbon is mainly composed of carbonates and represents globally more than half of the total soil carbon stock up to a 2-m depth. The dissolution of carbonates by fertilization-induced acidification may offset the global efforts aimed at organic carbon sequestration, yet this process is poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the effects of fertilization strategies on inorganic carbon contents and stocks to 120 cm soil depth by using natural delta C-13 signature of organic and inorganic carbon in 32- and 40-year field experiments. Results show that long-term application of mineral nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizers acidified soils by 0.2 pH units. This caused inorganic carbon dissolution and carbon dioxide emissions of 9-12 Mg C per hectare, representing 12-18% of the initial stock in the top 60 cm. By contrast, manure application increased inorganic carbon stock by 8.9-11 Mg C per hectare, representing 4.8-17% of the initial stock up to 120 cm depth. The main pathway of inorganic carbon accumulation under organic fertilization is the neoformation of pedogenic carbonates and the conservation of lithogenic carbonates. Manure combined with mineral fertilizers did not affect inorganic carbon and therefore provides an optimal solution to mitigate carbon losses from soil.

However, due to the inconsistent spatial resolution, the sensitivity of Sentinel-2 data to detect iron-bearing minerals may be decreased by excluding the 60 m bands and neglecting the 20 m vegetation red-edge bands. Hence, the capability of Sentinel-2 for iron-bearing minerals mapping were assessed by applying a multivariate (MV) method to pansharpen Sentinel-2 data. Firstly, the Sentinel-2 bands with spatial resolution 20 m and 60 m (except band 10) were pansharpened to 10 m. Then, extraction of iron-bearing minerals from the MV-fused image was explored in the Cuprite area, Nevada, USA. With the complete set of 12 bands with a fine spatial resolution, three band ratios (6/1, 6/8A and (6 + 7)/8A) of the fused image were proposed for the extraction of hematite + goethite, hematite + jarosite and the mixture of iron-bearing minerals, respectively. Additionally, band ratios of Sentinel-2 data for iron-bearing minerals in previous studies were modified with substitution of narrow near infrared band 8A for band 8. Results demonstrated that the capability for detection of iron-bearing minerals using Sentinel-2 data was improved by consideration of two extra bands and the unified fine spatial resolution.					戈, 文艳/ACN-1857-2022; Fei, Wang/J-8497-2013	Fei, Wang/0000-0002-5213-4399; Ge, Wenyan/0000-0003-3462-9045														2072-4292				SEP	2020	12	18							3028	10.3390/rs12183028	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12183028													WOS:000580168100001

This can affect the accuracy of carbon-nitrogen-water cycle simulations for the soil-crop systems and hamper our understanding of internal mechanisms that control plant leaf stomatal conductance (g(sw)). To evaluate the simulations of PFM effects on g(sw), the three models (i.e., Ball-Woodrow-Berry (BWB), Ball-Berry-Leuning (BBL), and unified stomatal optimization (USO) models) were used. The two model modification factors were leaf-air temperature difference (delta T) and a water response function (f(theta)). A two-year maize (Zea mays L.) field experiment was conducted under different PFM (black, transparent, and no-mulch). The performance of the BWB model was poor under varying water status in the arid irrigation area. As for the BBL and USO models, the coefficient of determination and modified efficiency coef-ficient of the modified models increased 5.8%-90.6% and 6.5%-145.4%, respectively, compared with the initial models. The root mean square error and relative error of the modified models decreased 3.5%-67.9% and 4.8%- 65.6%, respectively. The delta T and f(theta) factors effectively improved the BBL and USO models, but the f(theta)-modified models performed better than delta T-modified models under PFM. Overall, our results suggest that the maize land implemented with plastic film mulching has altered biophysical conditions, leading to significant changes in crop photosynthesis, leaf-air temperature difference and top-soil water conditions. Accurate estimates of stomatal conductance require the model to consider water response functions and leaf-air temperature difference, particularly in environmental conditions associated with different extents of water deficit or drought.

At present, the applicability evaluation system of ET0 models is still lacking in several climate regions in China, leading to the confusion in application of the ET0 model in some specific regions. In this study, the daily meteorological data of 84 representative stations in four climate regions of China during the past 30 years (1991-2019) were selected to evaluate the ET0 simulation results of twelve empirical models (four temperature models, five radiation models, and three hybrid models) on the daily scale, and the optimal models suitable for each climate region were screened. Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) was used to optimize the optimal model to improve the simulation accuracy, and the ET0 results were compared with those predicted by extreme learning machine (ELM). The results showed that the estimation accuracy of the hybrid model was the best throughout China, followed by the radiation model, and the temperature model was relatively poor, with R-2 ranges of 0.77-0.88, 0.60-0.86, and 0.58-0.82, respectively. Among the temperature-based models, Hargreaves-Samani and Improve Baier-Robertson model had the highest accuracy, with R-2 of 0.80 and 0.79. Among the radiation-based models, Priestley-Taylor and Jensen-Haise models had the best accuracy, with R-2 of 0.82 and 0.79. Among the hybrid models, Penman model had the highest accuracy, with R-2 of 0.84. The accuracy of Hargreaves-Samani and Improve Baier-Robertson model in SMZ climate region was higher than TCZ, TMZ, and MPZ, and the accuracy of Jensen-Haise model in TCZ was the highest. The estimation accuracy of Priestley-Taylor and Penman models was similar in SMZ, TCZ, TMZ and MPZ. Using WOA to optimize the optimal temperature, radiation, and hybrid models, the prediction accuracy was improved by 12.05 %, 11.06 %, and 10.46 %, which were higher than the result of ELM model, with R-2 of 0.90, 0.91, 0.95 and 0.90, respectively. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt WOA to optimize the empirical model to estimate the ET0 all over China.

Considering the non-normal and nonlinear nature of time series data of spiders, non-parametric techniques were applied with developed algorithm based on combinations of wavelet-regression and wavelet-artificial neural network (ANN) models. Haar wavelet filter decomposed each of the series to extract the actual signal from the noisy data. Prediction accuracy of developed models, viz., multiple regression, wavelet-regression, and wavelet-ANN, tested using root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), indicated better performance of wavelet-ANN model. Diebold Mariano (DM) test also confirmed that the prediction accuracy of wavelet-ANN model, and hence its use to forecast spiders in conjunction with the values of pest-defender ratios, would not only reduce insecticidal sprays, but also add ecological and economic value to the integrated pest management of insects of pigeon pea.

J	Bai, XJ; Yang, X; Zhang, SM; An, SS				Bai, Xuejuan; Yang, Xuan; Zhang, Shumeng; An, Shaoshan			Newly assimilated carbon allocation in grassland communities under different grazing enclosure times	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS												The flow of photosynthesized carbon (C) from plants to soil and its loss from the respiration in the soil-plant system were measured via in situ(13)CO(2) pulse labeling pasture in overgrazed and long-term grazing exclosures (where grazing was not permitted for 5, 10, and 30 years). During a 30-day chase period, the allocation of newly assimilated C in the shoots, roots, and soil of grazing-excluded grasslands was higher than that in overgrazed grasslands. But the newly assimilated C allocated to shoots and soil respiration in overgrazed grasslands was significantly higher than that in grazing-excluded grasslands. Thirty days after labeling, 35% and 40% of the newly assimilated C in overgrazed grasslands were lost through shoots and soil respiration, respectively. The shoot C-13 recovery was 32% in the 30 years 30 days after labeling, which was significantly higher than that obtained at the 5 and 10 years exclosure sites. Root and soil C-13 recoveries in the 5- and 10-year exclosures were higher than those at the 30-year sites. In the grazing-excluded grasslands, the amount of C-13 in soil organic C peaked 3 days after (CO2)-C-13 exposure and became relatively stable after 19 days of assimilation. The mean C residence time for non-structural C used in the soil respiration under overgrazing (10 days) was shorter than that under 5- (20 days) and 10- (17 days) or 30-year exclosures (14 days). Compared to overgrazing, grazing exclosure, especially moderate grazing exclosure, led to more allocation of newly assimilated C in the plant-soil system but fewer allocation in shoots and soil respiration.																			0178-2762	1432-0789				MAY	2021	57	4					563	574		10.1007/s00374-021-01549-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-021-01549-1		MAR 2021											WOS:000626780800001

However, H-g measurements are highly costly and time-consuming, which makes H-g data unavailable in most regions of the world. Therefore, numerous empirical and data-driven models have been established to predict H-g using other commonly available meteorological data. The present study proposed three data-driven models, i.e., extreme learning machine (ELM), random forests (RF) as well as the hybrid genetic algorithm and backpropagation neural networks (GANN), for accurate prediction of daily H-g in Northwest China. Daily minimum, maximum air temperature, sunshine duration and relative humidity were used to train and assess the models. The performance of the three data-driven models were also compared against two widely used empirical models (Angstrom Prescott and Ogelman models). The results demonstrated that the estimated H-g had statistically significant correlations (P < 0.001) with the measured values. A sensitivity analysis indicated that sunshine duration was the most influential variable on H-g prediction in the three data-driven models. Generally, the data-driven models provided better estimates, compared with the two empirical models. The ELM model had the closest daily H-g estimates, followed by the GANN and RF models, with average global performance index (GPI) of 1.516, 1.261 and 0.000, respectively. Thus, the ELM model is highly recommended for daily H-g estimation in Northwest China. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, a critically needed comparison on the effectiveness of C sequestration between planted forest (PF) and natural forest (NF) in water-limited areas has rarely been conducted at a regional scale. This study synthesized 275 publications to examine the changes of C stock in above-ground biomass (AGB), below-ground biomass (BGB) and deep soils (0-200 cm) between PF and NF in the China's Loess Plateau, a typical water-limited region with extensive afforestation. We found that, NF stored more than twice as much C as did PF in both biomass and soil. But PF allocated relatively higher proportion of C stock to BGB and deep soil layer (> 100 cm) than NF. Moreover, the C sequestration rates in biomass and soil for PF were 1.42 and 1.72 Mg C ha-1 yr-1, respectively, much higher than that of NF (0.13 and -1.38 Mg C ha-1 yr- 1). In addition, afforestation in areas with the mean annual precipitation (MAP) greater than 505 mm may promote both biomass and soil C accumulation without causing severe soil water deficit. Moreover, the increase in mean annual temperature (MAT) could significantly promote the C accumulation in both biomass and soil of PF but accelerated the soil C loss of NF. Overall, our results indicate that afforestation in water-limited areas may exhibit higher potential to sequester C than naturally regeneration, and afforestation is worth promoting with careful consideration of planting density and rainfall zones to avoid causing excessive water depletion. This study has important implications for the forest management in water-limited areas particularly under global climate change.

In this study, 43 NtBBX genes were identified and divided into five subgroups in tobacco. The members in each subgroup had similar characteristics. The promoter region of NtBBX genes had cis-acting elements related to light response, hormone regulation and stress response. Transcriptome analysis showed that NtBBX30 was significantly up-regulated, and NtBBX12, NtBBX13, NtBBX16 and NtBBX17 were significantly down-regulated under abiotic stresses. The NtBBX genes also responded to the infection of Ralstonia solanacearum. NtBBX9, NtBBX1, NtBBX15 and NtBBX17 showed the greatest response under stresses. The NtBBX genes are expressed in various degrees under different tissues. This research will provide a solid foundation for further study of the biological function of NtBBX genes in tobacco.

Such knowledge gap hinders our comprehensively understanding about biogeochemistry cycling, the development of sustainable soil management practices and the restoration of degraded lands in an eroding environment. Herein, we compared the bacterial communities in the eroding, depositional, and adjacent non-eroding forest zones in the China's Loess Plateau to explore how erosion and deposition alter soil bacterial communities and multifunctionality. We used the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess bacterial richness and community composition and analyzed co-occurrence networks to elucidate the associations among microbes. We also measured a series of soil functional parameters to assess soil multifunctionality and analyzed the relationship between soil multifunctionality and bacterial community structures. While erosion significantly reduced soil bacterial richness and multifunctionality, much of this loss was recovered in the depositional zone, with greater values in depositional zone than eroding zone. Soil erosion and subsequent deposition significantly decreased the complexity and connectivity of bacterial co-occurrence network compared with the forest. Soil multifunctionality was regulated by bacterial richness, community compositions and network complexity. Random forest modeling showed specific ecological clusters were the optimal predictors of multifunctionality, which was positively affected by Acidobacteria dominated network module but negatively affected by Actinobacteria dominated network module. This study suggests deposition can alleviate negative impacts of erosion on bacterial community richness and soil multifunctionality, and thus would be helpful for developing sustainable soil management and restoring degraded lands in eroding environments.

We conducted a field survey to investigate the relationship between plant community composition and soil physical and chemical properties alongside different degradation stages of alpine grassland. Results showed that with the increasing severity of degradation, the dominant plants shifted from sedge and graminoid species, respectively, to forbs species in alpine meadow (AM) and alpine steppe (AS). Species richness and diversity indices were unchanged until the severely degraded stage in both AM and AS. Forward selection showed bulk density (BD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+) at 1020 cm, pH and the ratio of soil organic carbon to total nitrogen (C/N) at 010 cm were the four important variables being responsible for the species community variation alongside degradation of AS, which explained 18.7% of the total variance. Soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3-) and C/N at 2030 cm, NH4+ at 1020, and BD at 010 cm were the important variables in driving the community variance alongside degradation stages, which only explained 9.5% of the total variance of AM. The loss of dense root layer and the species community change induced change in BD, and difference in plant competition for available resources would lead to the stronger association between vegetation community and soil properties in AS than that in AM. Our results indicate that though improving soil nutrients and soil texture to restore the degraded AS may be more effective than to restore degraded AM.

Identifying regional changes in frequency and severity of drought induced by climate change is required to develop regionally specific adaptation strategies. In this study, we provided a first look at the impacts of climate change on 21st century drought characteristics over the New South Wales wheat belt of southeastern Australia. These impacts were assessed from an ensemble of 28 statistical downscaled global climate models under representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5). A modified relative standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index (rSPEI) at the seasonal scale (3 months) was used to analyse temporal and spatial changes in drought. Results indicated that there was a tendency towards more frequent and severe winter-spring droughts over the study area. Moreover, winter-spring drought prone areas were expected to expand from west to east. Until the end of the 21st century, more than half the wheat belt would be vulnerable to winter-spring drought. The combined effects of reduced precipitation and increased temperature during future winter and spring seasons were the main reasons causing these changes of drought. In addition, summer and autumn droughts would have both slight temporal and spatial changes across the study region. This study also revealed that traditionally dry areas would likely experience an increased frequency of drought compared to wetter areas when subjected to a same increase in temperature or decrease in precipitation. Furthermore, the western part of the wheat belt might be unsuitable for winter crops in the future, or at least exposed to an increased risk of variable yield and would require a gradual transformation which might include summer crops or pastures. Investments in cropping land should be focused on the east part of the wheat belt to achieve more consistent financial returns.					, De Li Liu/Y-4656-2019; zhang, mingxi/GYI-9562-2022; Wang, Bin/AFI-6568-2022; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009	Wang, Bin/0000-0002-6422-5802; Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821; Liu, De Li/0000-0003-2574-1908; Waters, Cathleen/0000-0003-1020-5248; Feng, Puyu/0000-0003-4845-9876													0899-8418	1097-0088				FEB	2019	39	2					1041	1053		10.1002/joc.5861	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.5861													WOS:000459665000030

Machine learning algorithms are promising methods for drought prediction as they require less time, minimal inputs, and are relatively less complex than dynamic or physical models. In this study, a combination of machine learning with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) is proposed for analysis of drought within a representative case study in the Tibetan Plateau, China, for the period of 1980-2019. Two timescales of 3 months (SPEI-3) and 6 months (SPEI-6) aggregation were considered. Four machine learning models of Random Forest (RF), the Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB), the Convolutional neural network (CNN) and the Long-term short memory (LSTM) were developed for the estimation of the SPEIs. Seven scenarios of various combinations of climate variables as input were adopted to build the models. The best models were XGB with scenario 5 (precipitation, average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, wind speed and relative humidity) and RF with scenario 6 (precipitation, average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and sunshine) for estimating SPEI-3. LSTM with scenario 4 (precipitation, average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, wind speed) was relatively better for SPEI-6 estimation. The best model for SPEI-6 was XGB with scenario 5 and RF with scenario 7 (all input climate variables, i.e., scenario 6 + solar radiation).

These responses may help leaves maintain advantageous photosynthetic capacity and/or be a response to recent photosynthate accumulation, and can occur within days after a change in thermal regime. It is not clear, however, how the sensitivity and magnitude of this response change over time, or which time period prior to a given measurement best predicts R-20. Nor is it known whether nighttime, daytime, or 24-hour temperatures should be most influential. To address these issues, we used data from 1620 R-d temperature response curves of 10 temperate and boreal tree species in a long-term field experiment in Minnesota, USA to assess how the observed nearly complete acclimation of R-20 was related to past temperatures during periods of differing lengths. We hypothesized that R-20 would be best related to prior midday temperatures associated with both photosynthetic biochemistry and peak carbon uptake rates that drive carbohydrate accumulation. Inconsistent with this hypothesis, prior night temperatures were the best predictors of R-20 for all species. We had also hypothesized that recent (prior 3-10 days) temperatures should best predict R-20 because they likely have stronger residual impacts on leaf-level physiology than periods extending further back in time, whereas a prior 1- to 2-day period might be a span shorter than one to which photosynthetic capacity and R-d adjust. There was little to no support for this idea, as for angiosperms, long time windows (prior 30-60 nights) were the best predictors, while for gymnosperms both near-term (prior 3-8 nights for pines, prior 10-14 nights for spruce/fir) and longer-term periods (prior 45 nights) were the best predictors. The importance of nighttime temperatures, the relatively long "time-averaging" that best explained acclimation, and dual peaks of temporal acclimation responsiveness in some species were all results that were unanticipated.

A factorial [urea (0, 60, 120, and 180 kg N ha(-1))] and tank silt (0 and 30 t ha(-1)) replicated thrice randomized block design was employed for this investigation. Results of the study showed that maize grain yield was significantly influenced by the sole application of both N fertilizer and TS. When both the N fertilizer and TS were combined, the grain yield was significantly (p < 0.01) improved by 5% (4870 kg ha(-1)) over the highest yield observed under only N. We have noticed a significant (p < 0.01) residual effect of N and TS on horsegram straw yield during all the years of experimentation. With the increase in N-rate, there was an increasing trend in CO2 emission noticed in all the years including the pooled year data. Compared to CO2 emission, N2O emission was greatly influenced by nutrient management and amendment application. Among the seasons, the post-rainy season (Rabi) had a slightly lower emission trend of CO2, during all the years as compared to the rainy season (Kharif). The observed results marked the marginal increasing trend of cumulative CO2 (cCO(2)) emissions with regard to increasing doses of urea. Tank silt addition slightly favoured a CO2 emissions. The trend of cumulative N2O (cN(2)O) emission was greatly influenced by the dose of urea following the order of N-180 > N-120 > N-60 > N-0. However, N fertilizer application influenced the cCO(2) emissions (r = 0.83), and significantly increased the cN(2)O emission (r = 0.99). Therefore, optimum and timely application of urea combined with TS is recommended as an effective strategy to combat GHG-based emissions (specifically N2O based) in semiarid rainfed regions.

However, less is known about how soil modulates regionally specific impacts and soil properties that are able to alleviate adverse impacts of climate warming on maize productivity. In this study, we investigated the impacts of multiple soil inherent properties on the sensitivity of maize yield (S-Y,S-T) to growing season temperature across China. Our results show that a 1 degrees C warming resulted in the largest yield decline (11.2 +/- 6.1%) in the mid-eastern region, but the moderate yield increase (1.5 +/- 2.9%) in the north-eastern region. Spatial variability in soil properties explained around 72% of the variation in S-Y,S-T. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content positively contributed the greatest extent (28.9%) to spatial variation of S-Y,S-T, followed by field capacity (9.7%). Beneficial impacts of increasing SOC content were pronounced in the north-eastern region where SOC content (11.9 +/- 4.3 g kg(-1)) was much higher than other regions. Other soil properties (e.g., plant wilting point, sand content, bulk density, and saturated water content) were generally negatively correlated with S-Y,S-T. This study is the first one to answer how soil inherent properties can modulate the negative impacts of climate warming on maize yield in China. Our findings highlight the importance of SOC in alleviating adverse global warming impacts on maize productivity. To ensure food security for a rapidly increasing population under a changing climate, appropriate farming management practices that improve SOC content could reduce risk of adverse effects of global climate warming through a gain in yield stability and more resilient production in China's maize belt.

The yak is a bovid on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau that traditionally only grazes natural pasture all year. During lactation, energy intake of yaks is often well below requirements, and yaks lose body weight. Today, to mitigate body weight losses during lactation, suckling yaks are often offered supplementary feed. This study examined the effect of dietary supplements on rumen bacteria in lactating yak. The yaks were offered supplementary concentrate feed (C), rumen-protected Lys and Met (RPA), or both (RPA+C). The ratio of the relative abundance of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in RPA+C was greater than in the RPA group, while there was no difference between C and RPA+C. The intakes of supplements resulted in a number of alterations in the abundances of bacteria at the genus level. When supplemented with C, yaks increased the concentration of ruminal total volatile fatty acids (VFAs), acetate, and butyrate. These results demonstrate that supplementary feed: (1) alters the composition of rumen microbiota and VFAs of lactating yaks; and (2) can be used to manipulate the composition of rumen microbiota. Traditionally, yaks graze only natural pasture all year round without supplements. Forage intake of lactating yaks is below energy and protein requirements, even in the summer, and suckling yaks lose a substantial amount of significant body weight. Today, to mitigate the loss in body weight, supplementary feed is being offered to lactating yaks. However, the effects of supplementary feed on ruminal bacterial communities in lactating yaks is unknown. In the current study, we examined the effect of supplementary feed on ruminal microbiota, using 16S rRNA sequencing, and on volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Twenty-four lactating yaks of similar body weight (218 +/- 19.5 kg) and grazing natural pasture were divided randomly into four groups and received different supplements: (1) rumen-protected amino acids (RPA); (2) concentrate feed (C); (3) RPA plus C (RPA+C); and (4) no supplements (control-CON). The concentrations of total VFAs, acetate, and butyrate were greater (p < 0.05) when supplemented with concentrate feed (C and RPA+C) than without concentrate feed (CON and RPA). Bacteroidetes (B) and Firmicutes (F) were the dominant ruminal bacterial phyla in all groups. The ratio of relative abundance of F:B in RPA+C was greater than in the RPA group, while there was no difference between CON and RPC (interaction, p = 0.026). At the genus level, the relative abundances of Absconditabacteriales_SR1, Bacteroidales-RF16-group, Bacteroidales_BS11_gut_ group, Prevotellaceae, and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group were lesser (p < 0.05) with supplementary concentrate feed (C and RPA+C) than without concentrate feed (CON and RPA), whereas Butyrivibrio_2 and Pseudobutyrivibrio were greater (p < 0.05) with supplementary rumen-protected amino acids (RPA and RPA+C) than without rumen-protected amino acids (CON and C). These results demonstrate that supplementary feed: (1) alters the composition of rumen microbiota and concentrations of ruminal VFAs in lactating yaks; and (2) can be used to manipulate the composition of rumen microbiota.

Farm-level adaptation could serve as an important tool to manage these production risks. This study took the case of a vulnerable farming community of Raya Azebo district of Tigray region of Ethiopia to map household level perceptions of climate change and its induced risks, adaptation strategies, and associated factors. A multi-stage sampling approach is used to select a sample of 397 farm households from the study area and analyzed using descriptive and interferential statistics. Results show that farm households perceived significant changes in the climate, such as an increase in temperature (overall), a decline in precipitation (overall), and altering patterns of rainfall. Further, farmers' reported risks include droughts, floods, and increased pests and disease attacks on the crops. Farmers, in response to climate variability, were adopting various adaptation measures to manage climate risks at the farm-level. Crop diversification (99%), mulching (88%), soil and water management practices (78%), and use of alternative tillage practices (74%) were reported to be the most, while the use of improved seed (27%), planting trees (26%), mixed farming (12%), and home farm practice (3%) were reported to be the least adopted adaptation strategies. Results of the binary logit model showed that household head's age, literacy level, utilization of credit service, utilization of extension services, and access to farm water were the significant determinants of important adaptation strategies. This study implies improving rural households' access to various institutions-led services (i.e., climate information, advisory, and credit) to improve their adaptation and livelihood resilience.

Trottor) Accessions	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Susceptibility to lodging is a major constraint on teff production in Ethiopia, but efforts to develop lodging-resistant cultivars have not been successful. We studied the mechanical properties of teff culms and associated agro-morphological traits in field experiments with 320 teff accessions at two sites in northwestern Ethiopia during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The results showed significant variability in both mechanical properties and agro-morphological traits among accessions. Traits contributing to lodging resistance, such as internode diameter, pushing resistance, and base failure moment, were significantly positively correlated with each other and with plant height. Similarly, the correlation of those traits with lodging index was significant and positive. In contrast, tiller number showed a significant negative correlation with lodging index. The peduncle-panicle length, which generally accounted for 59% of the plant height, should be a target when breeding for semi-dwarfism. Root system development, which reached a depth of more than 1 m in tall and 57 cm in dwarf teff accessions, signifies the presence of genetic variabilities for future root lodging studies in teff, and it may also explain why teff performs well in drought-prone areas of Ethiopia. Breeding programs for lodging resistance might focus on accessions with good standing ability (high base failure moment) and introgression of stem strength with a semi-dwarf phenotype. Alternatively, selection for a large internode diameter, increased pushing resistance and base failure moment, and a reduced tiller number should be considered.

This study investigated the impacts of drought on ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) in southwest China. The spatiotemporal distribution of drought and ecosystem WUE were analysed through integrated approaches based on observed climate and satellite remote sensing datasets to understand the response of ecosystem WUE to drought. Also, the impacts of climatic variables on gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET) and WUE have been discussed. More than 30% of the total area can be categorized as suffering moderate drought. Six drought events (autumn 2006, autumn 2009, winter 2010, summer 2011, autumn 2011 and winter 2013) were identified during the period of 2001-2016. The average monthly WUE was 2.37 gC/kgH(2)O, showing a decreasing trend under the combined effects of drought and other environmental factors. Autumn 2006 exhibited the highest significant positive effect of drought on WUE on more than 80% of the total area that concentrated in the forest, shrubland, savanna and agriculture ecosystems. The results of this study have implications for ecosystem management and climate policy making that could allow implementing feasible water use strategies under a warming climate.

In the present study, we have utilized the RClimDex software to compute the trend in temperature and precipitation extreme events in the Varanasi district of Uttar Pradesh, India, from 1980 to 2018. We employed both Mann-Kendall test and linear regression to test the statistical significance of the computed trend. Out of 13 temperature indices, 8 showed a significant trend while the remaining showed a non-significant trend. The annual mean maximum temperature, warm days, diurnal temperature range and a monthly minimum of maximum temperature had decreased significantly by 0.029 & DEG;C, 0.159 days, 0.032 & DEG;C and 0.122 & DEG;C/yr respectively, whereas cool days and cold spell duration had increased significantly by 0.264 & DEG;C and 0.372 days/yr respectively, indicating an increased cooling effect over the study area. Similarly, out of the 11 rainfall indices, only two showed a significant trend, while the remaining showed a nonsignificant trend. The increasing drought over the study area is evident as the number of rainy days and consecutive wet days have decreased significantly by 0.262 days and 0.058 days/yr respectively, with a non-significant increase in consecutive dry days during the same period. The weak negative non-significant trend of a maximum of five consecutive days of rainfall, very heavy rainfall days and total annual precipitation indicate the decreasing trend of floods. This study stresses the development of adaptation plans to overcome the adverse consequences of extreme weather events in Varanasi district.

Quantification of drought and its impact on crop yield is essential to agricultural water resource management and food security. We investigated drought and its impact on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield in the Chinese Loess Plateau from 2001 to 2015. Specifically, we performed a varimax rotated principal component analysis on drought severity index (DSI) separately for four winter wheat growth periods: pre-sowing growth period (PG), early growth period (EG), middle growth period (MG), and late growth period (LG), resulting in three major subregional DSI dynamics for each growth period. The county-level projections of these major dynamics were then used to evaluate the growth period-specific impacts of DSI on winter wheat yields by using multiple linear regression analysis. Our results showed that the growth period-specific subregions had different major DSI dynamics. During PG, the northwestern area exhibited a rapid wetting trend, while small areas in the south showed a slight drying trend. The remaining subregions fluctuated between dryness and wetness. During EG, the northeastern and western areas exhibited a mild wetting trend. The remaining subregions did not display clear wetting or drying trends. During MG, the eastern and southwestern areas showed slight drying and wetting trends, respectively. The subregions scattered in the north and south had a significant wetting trend. During LG, large areas in the east and west exhibited wetting trends, whereas small parts in south-central area had a slight drying trend. Most counties in the north showed significant and slight wetting trends during PG, EG, and LG, whereas a few southwestern counties exhibited significant drying trends during PG and MG. Our analysis identified close and positive relationships between yields and DSI during LG, and revealed that almost all of the counties were vulnerable to drought. Similar but less strong relationships existed for MG, in which northeastern and eastern counties were more drought-vulnerable than other counties. In contrast, a few drought-sensitive counties were mainly located in the southwestern and eastern areas during PG, and in the northeastern corner of the study region during EG. Overall, our study dissociated growth period-specific and spatial location-specific impacts of drought on winter wheat yield, and might contribute to a better understanding of monitoring and early warning of yield loss.

And timely assessment of drought stress using remote sensing is valuable for improving the crop management level. In this study, the drought stress was evaluated in the maize planting areas of the Northeast and North China Plain using satellite remote sensing technology. The absolute distance index was used to identify the spatial pattern of the maize planting areas using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived enhanced vegetation index data that processed with Savitzky-Golay filter. The temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) was derived from MODIS normalized difference vegetation index and land surface temperature data. Simultaneously, soil moisture content (SMC) was obtained for an eight-day period and matched with satellite remote sensing data to characterize the drought stress of maize. After estimating the field capacity and wilting point, the SMC was further transformed into the real available water content (RAWC) of the soil. Our results indicated that negative correlations between RAWC and TVDI was observed for the 0-10 cm (R-2 = 0.594) and 20-30 cm (R-2 = 0.641) soil layers, respectively, which was significantly better than the correlation between the SMC and TVDI in the 0-10 (R-2 = 0.396) and 20-30 cm (R-2 = 0.499) soil layers. Moreover, the sensitive period regarding the maize water demand were identified (day of year 161, 169, 233, 241, and 249) via the linear regression analysis of the measured maize yield and TVDI for eight-day intervals. Furthermore, the weights of the water demand of maize in different growth stages was determined via multiple linear regression analysis, and a comprehensive drought index (TVDISW) was established to evaluate the drought stress in the whole maize growth period. Eventually, a comprehensive analysis for the drought stress in the study area was conducted combined with various environmental factors. Furthermore, the performance of this method was independent of the meteorological and field survey data, which may facilitate the mapping of drought monitoring of crops planting areas at a large scale.

Registration of 'Resilience CL plus ' soft white winter wheat	JOURNAL OF PLANT REGISTRATIONS												'Resilience CL+' (Reg. no. CV-1176, PI 686413; PVP 201800104) is a soft white common winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar carrying two-gene tolerance to imazamox herbicide that was developed and released in October 2016 by the Agricultural Research Center of Washington State University. It was tested under the experimental designations KCF9002 and WA 8187. Resilience CL+ was developed using marker-assisted background selection and marker-assisted forward breeding approaches involving a cross between a soft white winter wheat cultivar 'Madsen' and CL0618 (an Australian hard red spring two-gene Clearfield line). Resilience CL+ carries two mutation alleles (Als1 and Als2) of the acetolactate synthase gene (ALS) located on chromosomes 6DL and 6B1,. Resilience CL+ has high grain-yield potential, intermediate plant height, and is well adapted to regions of the inland Pacific Northwest (PNW) with >500 mm of annual precipitation. Resilience CL+ exhibited herbicide tolerance equivalent to AP503 CL2' and greater than the single-gene Clearfield cultivar 'ORCF-102'. Compared with the other Clearfield cultivars grown in the PNW, Resilience CL+ has a high level of resistance to stripe rust and foot rot resistance, similar to that of Madsen. Resilience CL+ has soft kernels, an excellent milling score, and good end-use quality characteristics. Yield comparison of Resilience CL+ with other popular cultivars demonstrated that it has greater yield than 'SY Ovation' and Madsen but is similar to ORCF-102.

Meanwhile, researchers reported that S plays a significant role in the productivity of the rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS). For the quantification of S response, a long-term field experiment was started at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research (ICAR-IIFSR), Modipuram, India. In total, 7 nutrient supply options were applied, i.e., organic, mineral fertilizer in the combination of integrated plant nutrition system (IPNS), and IPNS + berseem (B)/IPNS + cowpea (C) in the S availability of the soil in the RWCS. The results showed that the highest contribution in S availability by the total S (39%) is followed by the organic S (35%), sodium bicarbonate extractable sulfur (NaHCO3-ES; 7%), heat-soluble sulfur (SS; 7%), water-soluble sulfur (WSS; 4%), available S (4%), and inorganic S (4%) under different long-term nutrient supply options of RWCS. The continuous application of organic fertilizer and various IPNS options, such as the inclusion of pulses, significantly improved all S fractions in the soil and also offers an additional benefit in terms of sustainability of production and soil health as compared to the inorganic fertilizer fields. Overall, the results showed that IPNS showed its superiority over the rest of the treatment. The results also supported that the inclusion of pulses gives a further gain in terms of sulfur availability in soil systems under RWCS.																				2571-581X				SEP 16	2022	6								997269	10.3389/fsufs.2022.997269	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2022.997269													WOS:000862445900001

Histone acetylation is co-regulated by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). HAT plays an essential regulatory role in various growth and development processes by modifying the chromatin structure through interactions with other histone modifications and transcription factors in eukaryotic cells, affecting the transcription of genes. Comprehensive analyses of HAT genes have been performed in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. However, little information is available on the HAT genes in foxtail millet (Setaria italica [L.] P. Beauv). Results In this study, 24 HAT genes (SiHATs) were identified and divided into four groups with conserved gene structures via motif composition analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the genes was performed to predict functional similarities between Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and foxtail millet; 19 and 2 orthologous gene pairs were individually identified. Moreover, all identified HAT gene pairs likely underwent purified selection based on their non-synonymous/synonymous nucleotide substitutions. Using published transcriptome data, we found that SiHAT genes were preferentially expressed in some tissues and organs. Stress responses were also examined, and data showed that SiHAT gene transcription was influenced by drought, salt, low nitrogen, and low phosphorus stress, and that the expression of four SiHATs was altered as a result of infection by Sclerospora graminicola. Conclusions Results indicated that histone acetylation may play an important role in plant growth and development and stress adaptations. These findings suggest that SiHATs play specific roles in the response to abiotic stress and viral infection. This study lays a foundation for further analysis of the biological functions of SiHATs in foxtail millet.

Samples from the Meijiang River Basin were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after being pretreated by Soxhlet extraction, and their compositions, distributions and sources were evaluated. The current study presents the distribution of OCPs in the soils and sediments of the Meijiang River Basin. The results demonstrate that OCPs contamination is an important environmental concern due to the excessive use of these compounds in the agricultural and industrial sectors. The ratios of alpha-HCH/gamma-HCH, (DDE + DDD)/Sigma DDTs, p,p-DDT/o,p-DDT, and DDD/DDE were used as indices for identifying the possible pollution sources and assessing the decomposition of the parent compounds and the recent gamma-HCH and DDT inputs. At the XY (Xiyang) and DSGYY (Dongshenggongyeyan) sites, the pollutants had industrial origins. At other sites (QTH (Qutianhu), LXC (Longxichun), ZJC (Zhenjiaochun), HKC (Hekouchun), GS (Guangshan) and RGQ (Raogongqiao)), the pollution was caused by dissolved organic matter. The SHB site was polluted by transportation and upstream pollutants. At the SXC (Shixichun), YZX (Youzhihe), DSH (Dongshihe) and ZGG (Zhegupai) sites, the metabolite was p,p'-DDD and was produced in an environment with anaerobic conditions. At the FJC (Fujiangkou), QTH (Qiutianhu), GS (Guangshang) and MX (Meixi) sites, the metabolite was DDE and was produced under aerobic conditions. In view of the health risks, the risk quotients for these contaminants were evaluated, and all risk quotients were less than 1 under the best-case scenario. This result suggests that the investigated pollutants may pose little hazard to the local ecosystem. The sediments containing toxic pesticides had a less than 55% ecological risk, indicating that the ecological risk of HCHs in the soils from the Meijiang River Basin is low.

Leaf photosynthetic light response of summer maize: comparison of models and analysis of parameters	PHOTOSYNTHETICA												An experiment was performed in order to study the applicability of light-response models for summer maize (Zea mays L.) by using rectangular hyperbola model, nonrectangular hyperbola model, exponential model, binomial regression model, and modified rectangular hyperbola model (Ye model), respectively. Our results showed that the fitted effect of Ye model was best and photosynthetic parameters were closest to the observation. The photoinhibition coefficient was significantly negatively correlated with the light-saturation point (I-s), the light-saturation coefficient (gamma), and maximum net photosynthetic rate at light-saturation point (P-Nmax), respectively. P-Nmax and I-s, apparent quantum yield, and gamma performed significantly positive relationship, respectively. When the soil volumetric water content varied from 13 to 21%, P-Nmax had significant positive correlation with the soil water content and stomatal conductance. Under water and temperature stress, the net photosynthetic rate decreased and photoinhibition occurred, which could be well simulated by the Ye model. It seems that Ye model would have more applications, especially for the regions with strong solar radiation.

J	Zhao, CL; Shao, MA; Jia, XX; Zhu, YJ				Zhao, Chunlei; Shao, Ming'an; Jia, Xiaoxu; Zhu, Yuanjun			Factors Affecting Soil Desiccation Spatial Variability in the Loess Plateau of China	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Soil desiccation has occurred widely across the Loess Plateau (LP) of China because of excessive depletion of soil water by artificial ecosystems and limited long-term rainfall recharge. This may lead to soil degradation and failure of afforestation efforts, which threatens ecosystem health in the LP. However, spatial characteristics and controlling factors of soil water generally vary within different soil layers. This has implications of vegetation recovery in the LP and has been overlooked in previous studies. This study investigates the spatial characteristics of soil desiccation in different layers from the 0- to 5-m depth across the entire LP and explores the relationships between soil desiccation and environmental factors. The soil desiccated index (SDI) in the 0- to 1-m soil layer was patchy, while in the 1- to 5-m soil layer, the degree of soil desiccation generally increased from southeast to northwest following a gradient of decreasing rainfall. Soil desiccation in the forestland and grassland were more severe than that in the cropland because of higher evapotranspiration, lower precipitation recharge and lower soil water holding capacity. Soil desiccation at the shallow depth (0-1 m) was mainly attributed to climate factors whereas deep soil desiccation (1-5 m depth) was more likely attributed to the joint effects of climate factors and non-climate factors. The results of this study can help develop practical sustainable land management practices, regional water budgets and help restoration of environment in the LP of China.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				MAR-APR	2019	83	2					266	275		10.2136/sssaj2017.11.0391	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2017.11.0391													WOS:000466157500001

PLANT GENOME												Genetic enhancement for resistance against the pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera is crucial for enhancing production and productivity of chickpea. Here we provide some novel insights into the genetic architecture of natural variation in H. armigera resistance in chickpea, an important legume, which plays a major role in food and nutritional security. An interspecific recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from a cross between H. armigera susceptible accession ICC 4958 (Cicer arietinum) and resistant accession PI 489777 (Cicer reticulatum) was evaluated for H. armigera resistance component traits using detached leaf assay and under field conditions. A high-throughput AxiomCicerSNP array was utilized to construct a dense linkage map comprising of 3,873 loci and spanning a distance of 949.27 cM. Comprehensive analyses of extensive genotyping and phenotyping data identified nine main-effect QTLs and 955 epistatic QTLs explaining up to 42.49% and 38.05% phenotypic variance, respectively, for H. armigera resistance component traits. The main-effect QTLs identified in this RIL population were linked with previously described genes, known to modulate resistance against lepidopteran insects in crop plants. One QTL cluster harbouring main-effect QTLs for three H. armigera resistance component traits and explaining up to 42.49% of the phenotypic variance, was identified on CaLG03. This genomic region, after validation, may be useful to improve H. armigera resistance component traits in elite chickpea cultivars.

Effect of Nutrient Management on Soil Carbon Quantities, Qualities, and Stock under Rice-Wheat Production System	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												The nutrient management options have been contemplated to be sustainable strategies to sustain rice-wheat production systems and a conceivable option to maintain soil organic carbon (SOC) in soil systems. We hypothesized that carbon fraction could be a critical factor in improving carbon storage in cereal-based production systems. The results suggested that the adoption of IPNS legumes (berseem and cowpea), STCR, and OF improved SOC concentrations. It was observed that significantly higher (57%) contribution in carbon concentration very labile carbon (VLC) was trailed by the non-labile carbon (NLC, 23%), labile carbon (LC, 12%), and less labile carbon (LLC 8%) in the surface soil layer. Results showed that carbon stock varied from 11.73 to 18.39 and 9.95 to 11.75 t ha(-1) in the surface and subsurface soil depths, respectively, and significantly higher carbon stock was maintained in OF in both soil depths over the other nutrient management practices. Results showed that for the surface layer C-stocks registered in the following order (0-15 cm soil depth) OF (18.39 t ha(-1)) > IPNS + C (17.54 t ha(-1)) > IPNS + B (17.26 t ha(-1)) > IPNS (16.86 t ha(-1)) > STCR (15.54 t ha(-1)) > NPK (15.32 t ha(-1)) and unfertilized control (11.73 t ha(-1)). Overall, results suggested that the adoption of IPNS options addition of legumes significantly enhanced all carbon pools.

Trotter) Germplasms under Intensive and Conventional Management Conditions	AGRONOMY-BASEL												Teff is the most strategic cereal crop grown from high rainfall to drought prone areas of Ethiopia, where it covers nearly 30% of the land allotted for cereals. However, its productivity remains very low due to lack of knowledge and research interventions. To investigate the grain yield potential, estimate the genetic parameters, and the diversity, a pot experiment with intensive management and a field experiment with conventional management at two contrasting locations for two seasons using the same 317 genotypes and additional 3 improved cultivars in the field experiment were carried out. The results showed highly significant variation among the genotypes for grain yield, biomass, harvest index, and phenological traits under both experiments. The best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP)-adjusted grain yield performance of the genotypes ranged from 4.2 to 8.8 g/plant in the intensive management and 1.8 to 4.3 g/plant in the field growing condition with conventional management. Coefficient of genetic variation, heritability, and expected genetic advance for grain yield were the highest in both experiments. Among the phenological traits, the grain filling period in the intensive growing condition exceptionally showed the highest genetic coefficient of variation and genetic advance. The high grain yield performance and wider range of the harvest index observed under the intensive management condition with moderate to high heritability signifies the genetic potential of teff for further improvement through trait recombination.

This study measured CH4 fluxes by five pathways (sediments, pneumatophores, water surface, leaves, and stems) from four typical mangrove forests, including Kandelia candel without pneumatophores and three species with pneumatophores: Sonneratia apetala, Laguncularia racemosa and Bruguiera gymnorhiza-Bruguiera sexangula. The CH4 fluxes from sediments were 4.82 +/- 1.46 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) for K. candel and 1.36 +/- 0.17 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) for the other three with pneumatophores. Among the three communities with pneumatophores, S. apetala community had significantly greater emission rate than the other two(P < 0.05). Pneumatophores in S. apetala were found to significantly decrease CH4 emission from sediments (P < 0.01), while those in B. gymnorhiza-B. sexangula were significantly increase it (P < 0.05). CH4 fluxes from waters were 3.48 +/- 1.11 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), with the highest emission rate in the K. candel community for the duck farming. Leaves of mangroves except for those of K. candel were a weak CH4 daytime sink, but stems were a weak source. The total 72 ha of mangroves in the Changning river basin emitted about 8.10 Gg CH4 per year, with a weighted emission rate of about 1.29 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). Our results suggested that mangroves are only a small methane source to atmosphere with great contribution from sediments and waters, only slight contribution from leaves and stems. Pneumatophores of different mangrove species played different roles in CH4 fluxes from sediments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The model QUEFTS (QUantitative Evaluation of Fertility of Tropical Soils) was used to estimate balanced nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) requirements for maize production in the Northern Nigerian Savanna. Data from on-farm nutrient omission trials conducted in 2015 and 2016 rainy seasons in two agro-ecological zones in the Northern Nigerian Savanna (i.e. Northern Guinea Savanna "NGS" and Sudan Savanna "SS") were used to parameterize and validate the QUEFTS model. The relations between indigenous soil N, P, and K supply and soil properties were not well described with the QUEFTS default equations and consequently new and better fitting equations were derived. The parameters of maximum accumulation (a) and dilution (d) in kg grain per kg nutrient for the QUEFTS model obtained were respectively 35 and 79 for N, 200 and 527 for P and 25 and 117 for K in the NGS zone; 32 and 79 for N, 164 and 528 for P and 24 and 136 for K in the SS zone; and 35 and 79 for N, 199 and 528 for P and 24 and 124 for K when the data of the two zones were combined. There was a close agreement between observed and parameterized QUEFTS predicted yields in each of the agro-ecological zone (R-2 = 0.69 for the NGS and 0.75 for the SS). Although with a slight reduction in the prediction power, a good fit between the observed and model predicted grain yield was also detected when the data for the two agro-ecological zones were combined (R-2 = 0.67). Therefore, across the two agro-ecological zones, the model predicted a linear relationship between grain yield and above-ground nutrient uptake until yield reached about 50 to 60% of the yield potential. When the yield target reached 60% of the potential yield (i.e. 6.0 t ha(-1)), the model showed above-ground balanced nutrient uptake of 20.7, 3.4 and 27.1 kg N, P, and K, respectively, per one tonne of maize grain. These results suggest an average NPK ratio in the plant dry matter of about 6.1:1:7.9. We concluded that the QUEFTS model can be widely used for balanced nutrient requirement estimations and development of site-specific fertilizer recommendations for maize intensification in the Northern Nigerian Savanna.						vanlauwe, bernard/0000-0001-6016-6027; Jibrin, Jibrin Mohammed/0000-0003-3757-289X; Shehu, Bello Muhammad/0000-0001-5042-6542; Merckx, Roel/0000-0001-6440-5363													0378-4290	1872-6852				SEP 1	2019	241								107585	10.1016/j.fcr.2019.107585	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2019.107585								31534300					WOS:000484872000027

The task is much more daunting in the fragile ecosystem of the Eastern Himalayan region of India. Soil disturbance from conventional tillage reduces soil productivity and is not sustainable and environmentally friendly. Conservation tillage is regarded as the best crop production practice in the Indian Himalayas, where soil is very easily erodible. Zero tillage alone encourages the growth of different species of weed flora in fragile hill ecosystems. However, live mulching of a pulse crop under zero tillage may be a very beneficial practice, as it aids several soil quality benefits and promotes root proliferation with good crop harvest. Hence, a field investigation was carried out for 3 consecutive years to assess the impact of live mulch-based conservation tillage on soil properties and productivity of summer maize. Five tillage practices, viz. no-till (NT), NT and cowpea coculture live mulch (CLM), minimum tillage (MT), MT+CLM, and conventional tillage (CT), were assessed in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Results revealed that continuous adoption of MT+CLM had the lowest bulk density (1.31 and 1.37 Mg m(-3)) and maximum water holding capacity (48.49% and 43.1%) and moisture content (22.4% and 25%) at 0-10 and 10-20 cm soil layers, respectively, after 3 years. The infiltration rate (2.35 mm min(-1)) was also maximum under MT+CLM, followed by NT+CLM. MT+LMC had 13.8 and 27.15% higher available nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, than CT at 0-10 cm soil depth. The MT+CLM gave a significantly higher maize grain yield (2.63 Mg ha(-1)), followed by NT+CLM (2.63 Mg ha(-1)) over the others. A cowpea green pod yield of 1.65 Mg ha(-1) was also obtained from the legume coculture. Thus, the study found that live mulch of cowpea under MT/NT improved soil quality and subsequently led to greater productivity of summer maize in the Himalayan region of India.					wani, Owais Ali Wani/AAZ-9585-2021; Rathore, S S/ABH-1847-2021; Kumar, Sanjeev/JTV-5459-2023	wani, Owais Ali Wani/0000-0002-0423-8329; Rathore, S S/0000-0001-6725-1478; Dr. SK Yadav, Sanjay Kumar Yadav/0000-0003-4647-5661; Babu, Subhash/0000-0003-4469-0157; SINGH, RAGHAVENDRA/0000-0002-0766-3806														2071-1050				OCT	2022	14	19							12078	10.3390/su141912078	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141912078													WOS:000867192000001

When combined with external agents such as climate, these alterations facilitate geomorphological evolution, such as gully erosion in hilly regions. The lack of fundamental understanding about how gully erosion forms have led to an increasing trend of gully erosion in recent years. Because the weathering-controlled properties of granite regolith have a significant effect on gully development, it is vital to assess the chemical weathering degree. However, despite extensive studies on quantifying weathering degree using chemical weathering indices, less is known about how these parameters are correlated with the mechanical properties of granite regolith. To this end, a typical weathering profile is established for granite in Jiangmen, China. This paper investigates the chemical weathering of granite, evaluates the appropriateness of previous chemical weathering indices, and correlates them with the mechanical parameters of granite regolith. Several suitable indices, including CIA, Bases/Al2O3, Bases/R2O3, ba(1), ba(3), CIW, I-mob, and PIA, are selected and correlated with the mechanical parameters. These indices apply well, with some scattering when they are correlated with the internal frictional angle of granite residual soil. This paper provides a comprehensive datset regarding the physical, mineralogical, petrographical, geochemical, and mechanical properties of granite regolith, and enhances the understanding of chemical weathering, especially its correlations with the mechanical properties of regolith.

However, there are some drawbacks and limitations in the automatic extraction of terraces, such as difficulty of outlining the overall boundary for individual terrace and the limitation of applying methods and parameters. In this study, we used machine learning methods on the basis of Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis using K-nearest neighbours and spectral angle mapper algorithms to extract terraces in the hilly and gully regions on the Loess Plateau, China. This study relied on medium-resolution image Landsat-8 combined with Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model to extract the overall boundary of terraces and relies on high-resolution images GaoFen-1 to extract the terraced edges of terraces. It used the methods of principal component analysis and Laplacian convolution filter to enhance and extract terraced edges inside of the boundary of terraces. Our estimates are with overall accuracy of 62.2% in K-nearest neighbours and 74.8% in spectral angle mapper methods, indicating the advantages of the proposed method despite the use of much lower resolution data than previous studies that used both high-resolution terrain and remote sensing imageries data. This study highlights the importance of using appropriate methods plus reasonable spatial resolution of remote sensing data for outlining the overall boundary of terraces in the hilly and gully regions.

Many of the previous approaches are from single year or single date measurements, even though the complete crop growth with multiple years would be required for an appropriate estimation of biomass. The aim of this study was to estimate the fresh matter biomass (FMB) by terrestrial hyperspectral imaging of the three crops (lablab, maize and finger millet) under different levels of nitrogen fertiliser and water supply. Further, the importance of the different spectral regions for the estimation of FMB was assessed. The study was conducted in two experimental layouts (rainfed (R) and irrigated (I)) at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, India. Spectral images and the FMB were collected over three years (2016-2018) during the growing season of the crops. Random forest regression method was applied to build FMB models. R-2 validation (R-val(2)) and relative root mean square error prediction (rRMSEP) was used to evaluate the FMB models. The Generalised model (combination of R and I data) performed better for lablab (R-val(2) = 0.53, rRMSEP = 13.9%), maize (R-val(2) = 0.53, rRMSEP = 18.7%) and finger millet (R-val(2) = 0.46, rRMSEP = 18%) than the separate FMB models for R and I. In the best derived model, the most important variables contributing to the estimation of biomass were in the wavelength ranges of 546-910 nm (lablab), 750-794 nm (maize) and 686-814 nm (finger millet). The deviation of predicted and measured FMB did not differ much among the different levels of N and water supply. However, there was a trend of overestimation at the initial stage and underestimation at the later stages of crop growth.

In this study, three types of instruments (a laser precipitation monitor, LPM; piezoelectric transducer, PT; and particle imaging transient visual measure-ment technology, PIV) were employed to measure and compare the raindrop size distribution (DSD) and rainfall kinetic energy rate (KEt) under simulated rainfall conditions. Comparisons of the results indicated that under the same simulated rainfall conditions, the number of raindrops per unit area measured by LPM was larger than that measured by PIV. The DSD measured by PIV was more uniform than that of the PT and LPM under the same rainfall conditions. The raindrop size range measured by the LPM was smaller than that measured by the PT and PIV. In addition, the geometric mean diameter was a more accurate representation of raindrop size because PIV can capture the true irregular shape of raindrops. Compared to the PIV sensor, the LPM underestimates the raindrop diameter. The median raindrop diameter measured and calculated by PIV using the geometric mean diameter was approximately 1.61 times that of LPM. The KEt values measured by PIV and PT were approximately similar, while the KEt calculated by LPM was 0.51 and 0.57 times that of PIV and PT for the same rainfall conditions, respectively. A correction factor of 1.75 provided an approximate reference for the calibration of the kinetic energy calculation of the LPM instrument. The above results can provide basic insights for calibration and application of the three instruments.					Liu, Gang/I-8858-2019; Elbasit, Mohamed A. M.

J	Alsafadi, K; Mohammed, S; Mokhtar, A; Sharaf, M; He, HM				Alsafadi, Karam; Mohammed, Safwan; Mokhtar, Ali; Sharaf, Mohammed; He, Hongming			Fine-resolution precipitation mapping over Syria using local regression and spatial interpolation	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Annual precipitation at 1 km2 spatial resolution have been produced over Syria for a referenced period of 1975?2010. The observations from 410 rain-gauges were interpolated over a regular grid by applying multivariate regression models (PSMRM) and local equations for sub-regions of the study area. This statistical method aims to model the influences of the essential geographical and topographical climatic factors, such as longitude, latitude, elevation, slopes, and aspects on the precipitation field in multiple local regions. The PSMRM is composed of two steps, (i) a potential surface of precipitation is calculated through multi-linear local regressions based on geographical and topographical information, then (ii) a kriging and IDW interpolation is applied to adjust the potential surface so as to better fit the station residuals (i.e. the difference between the observed values and the predicted values which are obtained from PSMRM). Ultimately, the models? accuracy was evaluated by 43 stations. The PSRMR-IDW-3 is found to be superior to all other models; the value of RMSE was 92.5 mm and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency NSE was 0.9187, while the Willmott index of agreement was 0.9808. In contrast, the PSMRM-OK-EXP was only superior to other models with the least mean absolute error (MEA) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE); the difference was 64.07 mm, i.e. 11.44%. However, all the proposed models were shown to be highly efficient compared to global models and can be considered an appropriate alternative to studying precipitation variability spatially over Syria.
